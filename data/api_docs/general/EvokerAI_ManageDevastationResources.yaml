  signature: void EvokerAI::ManageDevastationResources()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the resource allocation and usage for the Evoker's Devastation ability.
  description: The ManageDevastationResources method is responsible for handling the
    internal logic that governs how an Evoker AI allocates and utilizes resources
    required to cast the Devastation spell. This includes checking if sufficient mana
    or other resources are available, managing cooldown states, and determining when
    it is appropriate to use the ability based on game mechanics and AI decision-making
    criteria. The method ensures that the Evoker does not overuse or misuse the Devastation
    ability in a way that would break gameplay balance or violate the intended behavior
    of the spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      \    ManageDevastationResources();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to ensure proper resource management. It may interact with internal
    state variables such as cooldown timers, mana levels, or target conditions.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to resource depletion,
    incorrect ability usage, or unbalanced gameplay behavior for Evoker NPCs. Ensure
    that all checks and transitions are properly synchronized with the AI's overall
    decision-making flow.
