  class: Player
  method: GetLootGUID
  signature: const int & Player::GetLootGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player's loot object.
  description: The GetLootGUID method retrieves the GUID associated with a player's
    loot object, which is used to identify specific loot items within the game world.
    This GUID is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods and
    systems to manage player loot distribution and tracking. The method serves as
    a getter for the internal loot GUID variable, ensuring that players can access
    their own loot identifiers without direct manipulation of internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player's loot object, which
    is typically an integer value representing the specific loot item or container
    in the game world. This GUID is used for tracking and managing loot distribution
    across different players and instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int lootGUID = player->GetLootGUID();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class's internal loot management system
    and should be used carefully when dealing with loot-related operations. The GUID
    returned by this method is typically associated with a specific loot object and
    may not be directly usable for other purposes without proper context.
  warnings: The method should not be used to directly manipulate or modify loot objects;
    it only retrieves the GUID for tracking purposes. Incorrect usage can lead to
    unexpected behavior in loot distribution systems.
