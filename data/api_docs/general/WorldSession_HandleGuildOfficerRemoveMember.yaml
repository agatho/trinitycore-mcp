documentation:
  brief: Removes a guild member from the officer list, revoking their officer permissions.
  description: The HandleGuildOfficerRemoveMember method processes a client request
    to remove a specified guild member from the officer list. This action strips the
    target player of their guild officer privileges, including access to officer-only
    features such as managing guild members, setting guild information, and accessing
    the guild bank with elevated permissions. The method validates that the calling
    player has sufficient guild permissions (typically requiring officer or guild
    master status) before executing the removal. It ensures that the target is a valid
    guild member and that they currently hold officer status. This function is part
    of the core guild management system in TrinityCore, aligning with World of Warcraft's
    guild hierarchy mechanics where officers have elevated privileges within the guild
    structure.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildOfficerRemoveMember(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildOfficerRemoveMember&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would validate permissions and remove\
      \ officer status\n    // from the specified guild member.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a guild master or another officer sends
    a request to demote a guild member. The implementation should verify that the
    requesting player has appropriate authority and that the target is indeed an officer.
    It may also trigger updates to the guild's officer list in the database and broadcast
    changes to other guild members.
  warnings: Improper validation of permissions could lead to unauthorized removal
    of officers, potentially allowing players to strip privileges from others without
    proper authorization. This method must always validate that the calling player
    has sufficient rank before proceeding with any modifications.
