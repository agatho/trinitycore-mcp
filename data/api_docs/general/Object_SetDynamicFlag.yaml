  class: Object
  method: SetDynamicFlag
  signature: void Object::SetDynamicFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the dynamic flag of an object to control its behavior in the game world.
  description: This method allows developers to modify the dynamic flag of an Object,
    which determines how the object behaves within the game world. The dynamic flag
    is used to control various aspects such as whether an object is considered a 'dynamic'
    object, affecting its visibility and interaction with other players or NPCs. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with other object manipulation methods
    to ensure proper object state management.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The dynamic flag value to set for the object. Valid values are typically
      defined by the game's internal flags system, usually representing specific behaviors
      or states such as 'dynamic' or 'static'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->SetDynamicFlag(0x00000001); // Set dynamic flag to 1

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetDynamicFlag(DYNAMIC_FLAG_NONE);

      // This sets the player''s dynamic flag to none, making it static

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects how objects are handled
    in the game world. The dynamic flag is often used for determining visibility and
    interaction with other players or NPCs. It is recommended to understand the specific
    flags being set before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object behavior, including
    issues with visibility, interaction, or even potential crashes if not handled
    properly. Avoid setting invalid flag values.
