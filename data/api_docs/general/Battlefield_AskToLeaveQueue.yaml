documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the Battlefield queue.
  description: The AskToLeaveQueue method is responsible for removing a specified
    player from the Battlefield queue. This action typically occurs when a player
    wishes to leave the queue before being assigned to a battlefield instance. The
    method ensures that the player's queue status is properly updated and any associated
    resources are released. It is commonly invoked when players cancel their participation
    in a battlefield or when they are automatically removed from the queue due to
    inactivity or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that should be removed from the Battlefield
      queue. Must not be null and must represent a valid player currently in the queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Battlefield* bf = ...; // Get battlefield reference

      bf->AskToLeaveQueue(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Validation
    code: "if (player && player->InBattleground()) {\n    Battlefield* bg = player->GetBattlefield();\n\
      \    if (bg) {\n        bg->AskToLeaveQueue(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on players who are currently in a Battlefield
    queue. Calling it on players not in the queue may result in undefined behavior
    or errors. The method internally handles updating internal queue structures and
    notifying the player of their removal.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method does not validate whether the player
    is actually in a queue, so calling it on players not in queue may cause issues.
