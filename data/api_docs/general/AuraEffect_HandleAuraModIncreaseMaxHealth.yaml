  method: HandleAuraModIncreaseMaxHealth
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseMaxHealth(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the maximum health of a unit by applying or removing an aura effect
    that increases health.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseMaxHealth method is responsible for adjusting
    a unit's maximum health value when an aura that modifies health is applied or
    removed. This method is part of the aura effect handling system in TrinityCore,
    where it specifically manages the modification of a unit's base maximum health.
    When applied, it increases the unit's maximum health by a specified percentage
    or flat amount; when removed, it reverts the change. The method takes into account
    the AuraApplication context and the mode of operation to determine how the health
    modification should be processed. This is commonly used for effects like 'Increased
    Health' buffs, temporary health boosts, or debuffs that reduce maximum health.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains context about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating
      whether it's being applied (1) or removed (0). Used to control behavior during
      application/removal phases.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). Determines whether to increase or decrease the health value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Health Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 1; // Apply

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleAuraModIncreaseMaxHealth(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Health Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0; // Remove

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandleAuraModIncreaseMaxHealth(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the aura system when an aura
    is applied or removed. It directly modifies the target's maximum health attribute
    and may trigger recalculations of current health if necessary. The implementation
    relies on the AuraApplication context to determine the correct target and effect
    parameters.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper aura application context can
    lead to incorrect health modifications. Ensure that the AuraApplication object
    is valid and properly initialized before calling this method. Incorrect mode or
    apply flags may cause unexpected behavior in health calculations.
