  class: QuestStrategy
  method: ExploreQuestArea
  signature: void QuestStrategy::ExploreQuestArea(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates exploration of a quest area for the bot AI.
  description: The ExploreQuestArea method is responsible for triggering the bot AI
    to explore and interact with the designated quest area. This method typically
    handles the logic required to navigate to the quest's objective location, identify
    relevant NPCs or objects, and perform actions necessary to progress the quest.
    It integrates with the broader questing strategy system to ensure that the bot
    follows a logical path toward completing objectives within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and decision-making
      process.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the specific quest objective
      index or identifier within the current quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Strategy
    code: "void MyQuestStrategy::OnQuestAccept(BotAI* ai, uint32 questId)\n{\n   \
      \ int objective = 0;\n    ExploreQuestArea(ai, objective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot AI has been properly initialized and that
    the quest data is loaded in memory. The exploration behavior may vary depending
    on the type of quest (e.g., kill, collect, talk-to) and the specific implementation
    within the BotAI class.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective index passed to this method corresponds to a
    valid quest objective; otherwise, the bot may fail to perform expected actions
    or navigate incorrectly.
