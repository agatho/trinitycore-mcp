  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: EnableDetailedLogging
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::EnableDetailedLogging(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables detailed logging for combat behavior integration.
  description: The EnableDetailedLogging method controls whether detailed logging
    information is output for combat behavior events within the TrinityCore framework.
    This functionality is typically used during development and debugging to track
    the flow of combat-related actions, such as spell casts, damage calculations,
    and AI decision-making processes. When enabled, this method may increase log verbosity
    and potentially impact performance due to additional logging overhead. The setting
    persists until explicitly changed by another call to this method or until the
    system is reset.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether detailed logging should be
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Detailed Logging
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration integration;

      integration.EnableDetailedLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Detailed Logging
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration integration;

      integration.EnableDetailedLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or configuration settings within
    the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. It may affect performance in high-frequency
    combat scenarios due to increased logging output. Ensure that detailed logging
    is disabled in production environments to avoid excessive disk I/O and memory
    usage.
