  class: TurretAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int TurretAI::Permissible(const Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the TurretAI class can be used for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method is a virtual function in the TurretAI class
    that evaluates whether this AI type is appropriate for a specific creature. It
    is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and is called during AI assignment to determine
    if a creature should use the TurretAI behavior. The method typically returns a
    permissible value indicating the level of suitability, with higher values suggesting
    stronger compatibility. This allows for flexible AI selection based on creature
    properties or type.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the Creature object being evaluated for TurretAI usage.
      This parameter represents the specific creature instance that the AI system
      is attempting to assign an AI to.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the level of permissibility. A positive
    value suggests strong suitability, zero indicates no preference, and negative
    values imply incompatibility or disallowance of using TurretAI for this creature
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI assignment
    code: "int TurretAI::Permissible(const Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature\
      \ && creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->AIName == \"TurretAI\")\n        return\
      \ PERMIT_BASE_SPECIAL;\n    return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI assignment based on creature type
    code: "int TurretAI::Permissible(const Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (!creature)\n\
      \        return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n    \n    switch (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->Entry)\n\
      \    {\n        case 12345: // Example turret entry\n            return PERMIT_BASE_SPECIAL\
      \ + 10;\n        default:\n            return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI initialization phase when the
    game engine attempts to assign an appropriate AI behavior to a creature. It's
    important for developers to understand that returning values other than PERMIT_BASE_NO
    will allow the TurretAI to be considered for assignment, but it doesn't guarantee
    assignment. The actual assignment depends on other factors including AI priority
    and system load.
  warnings: Incorrect return values can lead to unexpected AI behavior or performance
    issues. Returning excessively high values may cause this AI type to override other
    more appropriate AIs. Always ensure that the permissible logic aligns with the
    intended creature behavior and game mechanics.
