  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: CalculateEmpoweredSpellDamage
  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateEmpoweredSpellDamage(int spellId, EmpowermentLevel
    level, int * caster, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates empowered spell damage for an evoker based on spell ID, empowerment
    level, and caster/target stats.
  description: 'The CalculateEmpoweredSpellDamage method computes the final damage
    value of an empowered spell cast by an evoker. It takes into account the specific
    spell being cast, the current empowerment level of the evoker, and the statistical
    attributes of both the caster and target. This method is used in the game''s combat
    system to determine how much damage an empowered spell will deal. The calculation
    considers various factors such as spell power, target resistance, and empowerment
    modifiers. Precondition: Valid spell ID and empowerment level must be provided;
    caster and target pointers should point to valid objects with appropriate stats.
    Postcondition: Returns calculated damage value or zero if calculation fails.'
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being empowered. Must correspond
      to a valid evoker spell in the game database.
  - name: level
    description: The empowerment level that determines the strength of the empowered
      effect. Should be one of the defined EmpowermentLevel enum values (e.g., LOW,
      MEDIUM, HIGH).
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the caster's stats or object data. Used to determine caster's
      spell power and other relevant attributes.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's stats or object data. Used to determine target's
      resistance and other relevant attributes.
  returns: Returns the calculated empowered spell damage as an integer. Zero is returned
    if the spell ID is invalid, empowerment level is unsupported, or calculation fails
    due to missing data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int damage = calculator.CalculateEmpoweredSpellDamage(12345, EmpowermentLevel::HIGH,
      &casterStats, &targetStats);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error checking
    code: "int spellId = 12345;\nEmpowermentLevel level = EmpowermentLevel::MEDIUM;\n\
      int damage = calculator.CalculateEmpoweredSpellDamage(spellId, level, &casterStats,\
      \ &targetStats);\nif (damage > 0) {\n    // Apply damage to target\n    target->TakeDamage(damage);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid calculation\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Failed\
      \ to calculate empowered spell damage for spell {}\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the evoker class's combat system and should only be
    called during active combat scenarios. The empowerment level affects the multiplier
    applied to base spell damage, with higher levels resulting in stronger effects.
    Performance-wise, this function may involve multiple lookups in spell databases
    and stat calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that both caster and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method; passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The spell ID must exist in the database, otherwise the calculation will fail.
    Be aware that empowerment levels beyond what is defined may cause unexpected results.
