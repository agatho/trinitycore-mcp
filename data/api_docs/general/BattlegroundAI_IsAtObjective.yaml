  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: IsAtObjective
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::IsAtObjective(int * player, const BGObjective &
    objective) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is at a specific battleground objective.
  description: The IsAtObjective method determines whether a given player is currently
    located at or near a specified battleground objective. This functionality is crucial
    for determining player proximity to objectives such as flags, bases, or capture
    points during battlegrounds like Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin. The method evaluates
    the player's current position against the objective's location and returns true
    if the player is within an acceptable range. It is commonly used in battleground
    AI logic to trigger events when players approach objectives, such as capturing
    flags or completing objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter specifies which player's position is being checked against the
      objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a BGObjective object that defines the battleground objective
      being evaluated. This contains information about the objective's location, type,
      and state.
  returns: Returns true if the player is at or near the specified objective, false
    otherwise. The exact distance threshold for 'at' is determined by the battleground's
    implementation and objective-specific logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI
    code: "if (BattlegroundAI::IsAtObjective(&playerGUID, objective)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is at the objective, trigger capture logic\n    objective->HandlePlayerEnter(playerGUID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple objectives for player proximity
    code: "for (auto& obj : battleground->GetBGObjectives()) {\n    if (IsAtObjective(&playerGUID,\
      \ *obj)) {\n        // Handle objective capture or interaction\n        HandleObjectiveInteraction(playerGUID,\
      \ obj);\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data and may be affected by network
    latency in multiplayer environments. The distance threshold for determining 'at'
    status is typically defined by the battleground's specific rules and objective
    type. Performance-wise, this method should be used judiciously in frequently called
    code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that player GUIDs are valid before passing them to this method.
    Passing null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior. The method assumes
    that the objective is active and properly initialized.
