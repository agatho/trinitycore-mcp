  class: GroupCoordinator

  signature: void GroupCoordinator::CoordinateCrowdControl(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates crowd control effects applied to a target unit within the group
  description: The CoordinateCrowdControl method manages and synchronizes crowd control
    mechanics across group members when applying effects to a specific target. This
    method ensures that group members properly coordinate their actions when casting
    crowd control spells or abilities on a shared target, preventing conflicts and
    maintaining proper group dynamics during combat situations. The method likely
    evaluates the current state of the group's crowd control abilities and adjusts
    their usage accordingly to maximize effectiveness while avoiding overlap or interference
    between group members' actions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be subjected to crowd control
      effects. This parameter must point to a valid Unit instance within the game
      world, typically representing an enemy target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Crowd Control Coordination
    code: "void ApplyCrowdControlToTarget(Unit* target)\n{\n    GroupCoordinator coordinator;\n\
      \    coordinator.CoordinateCrowdControl(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void GroupCombatManager::HandleEnemyTarget(Unit* enemy)\n{\n    if (HasCrowdControlAbilities())\n\
      \    {\n        GroupCoordinator coordinator;\n        coordinator.CoordinateCrowdControl(enemy);\n\
      \        // Proceed with coordinated CC application\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with group coordination systems and may involve
    checking for existing crowd control effects on the target, evaluating group member
    cooldowns, and ensuring optimal distribution of control abilities among group
    members. The implementation may include logic to prevent multiple players from
    applying the same type of crowd control simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is a valid Unit pointer before calling
    this method to avoid null pointer exceptions. This method should only be called
    in combat situations where group coordination is necessary for effective crowd
    control application.
