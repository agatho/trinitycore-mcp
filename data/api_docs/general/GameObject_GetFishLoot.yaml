  class: GameObject
  method: GetFishLoot
  signature: Loot * GameObject::GetFishLoot(int * lootOwner)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot table associated with fishing loot for the GameObject.
  description: The GetFishLoot method returns the Loot object that contains the fishing
    loot items for a specific GameObject. This method is used to access the fishing
    loot table which determines what items can be obtained when a player successfully
    fishes from this GameObject. The returned Loot object can be used to iterate through
    the loot items and apply appropriate loot rules or conditions. This functionality
    is essential for handling fishing mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly
    for objects that serve as fishing nodes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Loot object containing the fishing loot items associated
    with this GameObject. If no fishing loot exists, the method returns nullptr. The
    returned Loot object can be used to access and process the loot items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Loot * loot = gameobject->GetFishLoot();\nif (loot)\n{\n    for (auto i\
      \ = loot->begin(); i != loot->end(); ++i)\n    {\n        LootItem item = *i;\n\
      \        // Process the loot item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with fishing mechanics and requires
    proper initialization of the GameObject's loot table. Performance considerations
    include checking for null pointers before processing the loot items.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may return nullptr if no fishing
    loot exists for the GameObject, potentially causing a crash if not properly checked.
    The returned Loot object is only valid within the scope of the GameObject's lifetime.
