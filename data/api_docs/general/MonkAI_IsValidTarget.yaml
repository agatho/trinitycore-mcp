api:
  class: MonkAI
  method: IsValidTarget
  signature: bool MonkAI::IsValidTarget(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the current target is valid for the Monk AI.
  description: The IsValidTarget method evaluates whether the Monk AI's current target
    meets the criteria for valid engagement. This includes checking if the target
    exists, is within acceptable range, not dead, and not immune to the Monk's abilities.
    The method ensures that the AI does not attempt to attack invalid targets such
    as those that are out of range, dead, or otherwise ineligible for the Monk's combat
    actions. It serves as a crucial validation step in the Monk AI decision-making
    process before executing any attacks or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier. This
      parameter is used internally by the method to validate the target's state and
      eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the target is valid for the Monk AI to engage, otherwise
    returns false. A valid target must be alive, within range, and not immune to the
    Monk's abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI logic
    code: "if (monkAI->IsValidTarget(&targetId)) {\n    // Proceed with attack or\
      \ ability\n    monkAI->AttackTarget(targetId);\n} else {\n    // Find a new\
      \ target\n    monkAI->SelectNewTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with target selection system
    code: "void MonkAI::Update() {\n    if (!IsValidTarget(&currentTarget)) {\n  \
      \      // Find a new valid target\n        int newTarget = FindNearestValidTarget();\n\
      \        if (newTarget != 0) {\n            SetCurrentTarget(newTarget);\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before any combat action to ensure the AI
    does not waste resources on invalid targets. It may be optimized to avoid redundant
    checks by caching target validity states.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid memory location, as
    dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. The method
    assumes that the target ID is properly initialized before being passed.
