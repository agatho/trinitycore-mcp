documentation:
  brief: Returns the event subscription mask for group disbanded notifications
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method returns an integer value representing
    the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to. In the context of TrinityCore's
    group management system, this method indicates which specific group-related events
    the GroupDisbandedHandler instance will process. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a combination of event flags that define the scope of group lifecycle
    events the handler should respond to, particularly focusing on group disbanding
    scenarios. This method is part of the event-driven architecture used by the server
    to manage player groups and their associated notifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the subscribed events. Each bit in the
    integer corresponds to a specific event type, where group disbanded events are
    typically represented by a particular flag value within this mask.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GroupDisbandedHandler handler;\nint subscribedEvents = handler.GetSubscribedEvents();\n\
      if (subscribedEvents & GROUP_EVENT_DISBANDED)\n{\n    // Handle group disbanding\
      \ event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization or registration
    phase of event handlers. The returned bitmask should be checked against predefined
    event constants to determine which specific events are handled by this instance.
    Implementation may vary depending on how the TrinityCore event system is structured
    internally.
