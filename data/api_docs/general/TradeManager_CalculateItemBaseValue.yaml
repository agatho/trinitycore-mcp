  brief: Calculates the base value of an item for trade purposes based on its template
    data
  description: The CalculateItemBaseValue method computes a baseline monetary value
    for a given item template, which is used in trade negotiations and valuation within
    the TrinityCore framework. This calculation typically considers factors such as
    item quality, level, stats, and other intrinsic properties defined in the item's
    database template. The returned value serves as a foundation for determining fair
    trade prices between players or NPCs during trading interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated base monetary value of the item,
    typically expressed in copper coins. This value is used internally by the trading
    system to establish minimum acceptable trade values and to balance trade offers
    between parties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 baseValue = tradeManager->CalculateItemBaseValue(itemTemplate);\n\
      if (baseValue > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with trade logic using the calculated\
      \ value\n    std::cout << \"Item base value: \" << baseValue << \" copper\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal item template data structures and may
    perform calculations involving item stats, quality multipliers, and level-based
    modifiers. The exact formula used for calculation is not publicly documented but
    is consistent with World of Warcraft's trade valuation mechanics.
