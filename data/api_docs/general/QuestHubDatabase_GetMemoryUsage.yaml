  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: GetMemoryUsage
  signature: size_t QuestHubDatabase::GetMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of the QuestHubDatabase instance
    in bytes.
  description: The GetMemoryUsage method provides a snapshot of the current memory
    consumption by the QuestHubDatabase object. This includes all allocated memory
    for quest data structures, caches, and internal containers managed by the database.
    The method is typically used for performance monitoring, debugging, or memory
    profiling purposes within the TrinityCore framework. It performs a recursive calculation
    across all internal data members to determine total heap allocation. The returned
    value represents an approximate memory footprint and may include overhead from
    memory alignment and allocator metadata.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes of the QuestHubDatabase
    instance and its contained data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase* db = sQuestHubDatabase;

      size_t memoryUsed = db->GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("quest", "QuestHubDatabase is using %zu bytes of memory", memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Memory Growth Over Time
    code: 'auto startMemory = sQuestHubDatabase->GetMemoryUsage();

      // Perform some quest-related operations

      auto endMemory = sQuestHubDatabase->GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("quest", "Memory increased by %zu bytes", endMemory - startMemory);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve traversing large data structures and should not be
    called frequently in performance-critical code paths. The memory calculation includes
    both direct allocations and indirect memory overhead from STL containers and internal
    caching mechanisms.
  warnings: The returned memory usage value is approximate and may vary between different
    compiler versions or runtime environments due to memory allocator behavior. Do
    not rely on this method for precise memory accounting in production systems without
    additional verification.
