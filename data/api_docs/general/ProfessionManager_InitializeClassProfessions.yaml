documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific professions for all players in the world
  description: The InitializeClassProfessions method sets up and configures profession
    data specific to each player class within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically invoked during server startup or when loading player data to ensure
    that each class has access to their appropriate profession trees, skill levels,
    and associated abilities. It handles the internal population of profession-related
    tables and ensures that class-specific profession requirements are properly initialized
    for all active players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: ProfessionManager::InitializeClassProfessions();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It performs
    operations that affect all players in the world and may cause performance overhead
    if invoked multiple times. The method internally manages class-specific profession
    data structures and should not be called concurrently with other player loading
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this method after initial server startup may result in inconsistent
    profession states for existing players. Avoid invoking this during active gameplay
    sessions as it could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
