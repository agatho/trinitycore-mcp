  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float AdvancedBehaviorManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the advanced behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a float value representing the percentage
    of CPU time currently being consumed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager instance.
    This metric is useful for monitoring performance and identifying potential bottlenecks
    in AI behavior execution. The method typically calculates this value based on
    timing measurements taken during the manager's operation, often using high-resolution
    timers to determine how much time is spent processing behaviors versus idle time.
    The returned value ranges from 0.0 (no CPU usage) to 100.0 (full CPU utilization).
    This measurement can help developers optimize AI performance and ensure that behavior
    scripts do not consume excessive system resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 100.0 representing the percentage of CPU
    time currently used by this AdvancedBehaviorManager instance. A value of 0.0 indicates
    no active processing, while 100.0 indicates full CPU utilization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: "float cpuUsage = behaviorManager->GetCPUUsage();\nif (cpuUsage > 90.0f)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: High CPU usage detected: %.2f%%\", cpuUsage);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Logging with Thresholds
    code: "void LogBehaviorManagerPerformance()\n{\n    float usage = sObjectMgr->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->GetCPUUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 80.0f)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"High CPU Load: %.1f%%\"\
      , usage);\n    }\n    else if (usage < 10.0f)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Low CPU Load: %.1f%%\", usage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may use platform-specific timing functions to measure actual
    CPU time consumed. The accuracy of the measurement depends on the system's timer
    resolution and may vary between different platforms. The value returned is typically
    an average over a recent time window rather than instantaneous usage, which helps
    smooth out short-term fluctuations.
  warnings: The method should not be called excessively in performance-critical code
    paths as it may involve timing measurements that could introduce overhead. Additionally,
    the returned values are approximate and should be used for monitoring purposes
    rather than precise real-time control decisions.
