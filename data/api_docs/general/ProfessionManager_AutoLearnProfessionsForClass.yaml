  brief: Automatically learns all available professions for a given player class.
  description: The AutoLearnProfessionsForClass method automatically grants all applicable
    professions to a player based on their character's class. This function is typically
    used during character creation or when resetting profession data. It ensures that
    players start with the appropriate set of skills for their class, including primary
    and secondary professions. The method checks the player's class and applies the
    correct profession tree, considering game balance and progression mechanics. This
    functionality supports automated character setup and ensures consistent profession
    availability across different player classes.

      (GUID). The method uses this value to identify which player's professions should

    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionManager::AutoLearnProfessionsForClass(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Creation
    code: "void OnPlayerCreate(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\

  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's profession database and class-specific
    profession tables. It may be called during character creation or when resetting
    profession data to ensure proper skill distribution. The implementation might
    involve checking class-specific profession requirements and applying them in a
    predefined order.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player before calling this method. Incorrect usage could lead to undefined behavior
    or invalid profession assignments. This method should only be called during appropriate
    game states where player professions can be safely modified.
