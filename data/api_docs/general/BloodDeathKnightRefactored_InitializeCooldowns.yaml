documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for the Blood Death Knight's abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all initial cooldown
    timers for the Blood Death Knight's special abilities and spells. This method
    is typically called during the creation or reset of a Blood Death Knight character
    to ensure that all abilities start with their proper cooldown states. It initializes
    internal tracking structures for ability cooldowns, ensuring that the player cannot
    immediately use abilities after spawning or respawning. The method respects game
    balance by setting appropriate initial cooldown values based on the class's mechanics
    and spell properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = new BloodDeathKnightRefactored();

      dk->InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the character's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in unexpected cooldown behavior or conflicts
    with existing cooldown tracking. The method internally manages the cooldown state
    for abilities like Death Strike, Heart Strike, and other blood-oriented spells.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper initialization sequence
    as it may interfere with the normal cooldown management system. This method assumes
    all necessary spell data has been loaded and is available for cooldown assignment.
