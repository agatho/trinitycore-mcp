  method: LoadCreatureTemplates
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all creature templates from the database into memory for use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplates method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the ObjectMgr class with creature template information retrieved
    from the database. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    reloading creature data dynamically. It processes entries from the creature_template
    table and other related tables to construct CreatureTemplate objects that define
    the properties, behaviors, and statistics of all creatures in the game world.
    The loaded templates are stored in hash maps for fast lookup by entry ID, enabling
    efficient spawning and management of creatures during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadObjectTemplates()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureTemplates();\n\
      \    // Other template loading calls...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during server startup and should not
    be called repeatedly during runtime unless a full reload of creature templates
    is required. The method performs database queries to fetch all creature templates,
    which can be performance-intensive on large databases. It's recommended to run
    this method on a dedicated thread or during server initialization to avoid blocking
    the main game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal data structures. This method should
    not be called from within combat or high-frequency update loops as it may cause
    performance degradation or race conditions.
