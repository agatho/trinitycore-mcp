  class: Channel
  method: Say
  signature: void Channel::Say(const int & guid, const std::string & what, uint32
    lang) const
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts a message to all members of the channel with the specified language.
  description: The Say method sends a message to all players currently in the channel.
    It uses the provided GUID to identify the sender and broadcasts the message using
    the specified language. The method does not validate whether the GUID corresponds
    to an active player or if the language is valid, relying on higher-level systems
    for such checks. This method is typically used by the core's chat system when
    a player sends a message in a channel.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player sending the message. Used
      to identify the sender in the broadcast.
  - name: what
    description: The actual message content to be sent to all channel members. This
      is a string containing the text of the message.
  - name: lang
    description: The language identifier (LANG) used for the message. Determines how
      the message should be interpreted or displayed by clients.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a simple message in common language
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("General", player->GetTeam());

      channel->Say(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), "Hello everyone!", LANG_COMMON);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send a translated message using a specific language
    code: 'uint32 lang = LANG_ORCISH;

      std::string message = "Grats on your achievement!";

      channel->Say(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), message, lang);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the channel is already initialized and valid. It
    does not perform any checks for player presence or language validity internally.
    The actual message delivery is handled by lower-level systems in TrinityCore's
    networking layer.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid GUIDs or language values as it may
    cause undefined behavior or client-side issues. Ensure that the channel instance
    is valid and properly initialized before invoking this method.
