  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(int * target, int spellId,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an attempt to interrupt a spell cast by a target.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about a successful
    or failed spell interruption attempt made by a Demon Hunter AI. This method is
    typically used internally by the AI system to track combat interactions and maintain
    accurate combat state data. The method updates internal tracking mechanisms that
    may be used for cooldown management, threat calculation, or AI decision-making
    processes. It accepts a pointer to the target, the spell ID being interrupted,
    and a success flag indicating whether the interruption was effective.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit whose spell cast is being interrupted.
      This parameter represents the unit that was casting the spell at the time of
      interruption attempt.
  - name: spellId
    description: Identifier of the spell being interrupted. This value corresponds
      to the Spell ID in the game's database and determines which specific spell is
      being targeted for interruption.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interruption attempt was successful.
      True indicates a successful interruption, false indicates failure.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Attempt Recording
    code: 'DemonHunterAI* ai = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, 12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Interrupt Attempt
    code: 'DemonHunterAI* ai = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, 67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal combat tracking system for Demon
    Hunter AI behavior. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like GetLastInterruptTime()
    or UpdateInterruptCooldown() to manage spell interruption timing and cooldowns.
    The target parameter should be a valid pointer to an existing unit, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to crashes or memory corruption.
    The spellId should correspond to a valid spell in the game's database to ensure
    proper tracking and logging.
