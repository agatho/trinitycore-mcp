  method: GetFlags
  signature: uint32 CalendarEvent::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the calendar event.
  description: The GetFlags method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the flags set on the calendar event. These flags typically define various properties
    or states of the event, such as whether it is invite-only, locked, or has specific
    restrictions. The returned value can be used in bitwise operations to check for
    specific flag conditions. This method does not modify any internal state and is
    purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the bitmask of flags currently set on the calendar
    event. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific flag, such as 'invite-only',
    'locked', or 'raid-wide'.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an event is invite-only
    code: "uint32 flags = event->GetFlags();\nif (flags & CALENDAR_FLAG_INVITE_ONLY)\n\
      {\n    // Event is invite-only\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify if an event is locked
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event && (event->GetFlags()\
      \ & CALENDAR_FLAG_LOCKED))\n{\n    // Event cannot be modified\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined as constants in the
    TrinityCore codebase, such as CALENDAR_FLAG_INVITE_ONLY or CALENDAR_FLAG_LOCKED.
    Developers should ensure they understand the meaning of each flag bit to correctly
    interpret the result.
