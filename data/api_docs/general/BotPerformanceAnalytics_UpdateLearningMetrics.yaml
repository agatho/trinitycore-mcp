  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: UpdateLearningMetrics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UpdateLearningMetrics(uint32_t botGuid,
    double learningRate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates learning metrics for a specified bot using the provided learning
    rate.
  description: The UpdateLearningMetrics method is responsible for updating performance
    analytics related to a bot's learning process within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) and a learning rate value,
    then processes this data to refine the bot's performance metrics. The learning
    rate typically represents how quickly the bot adapts or learns from its environment
    or actions. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate performance
    tracking of AI-controlled bots in World of Warcraft environments. The method does
    not return any value but modifies internal analytics data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose learning metrics are
      to be updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot instance within the
      game world.
  - name: learningRate
    description: A double-precision floating-point value representing the rate at
      which the bot is learning. Typically ranges from 0.0 (no learning) to 1.0 (maximum
      learning). Values outside this range may be clamped or handled according to
      internal logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.UpdateLearningMetrics(12345, 0.75);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Bots
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids) {\n    analytics.UpdateLearningMetrics(guid, 0.8);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that store bot
    performance history and learning progress. It may be called frequently during
    gameplay, so performance optimization is important. The method should ideally
    be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid provided corresponds to an active bot instance;
    otherwise, the method might silently fail or cause undefined behavior. Avoid calling
    this method with invalid learningRate values (e.g., NaN or infinity) as it could
    corrupt internal analytics data.
