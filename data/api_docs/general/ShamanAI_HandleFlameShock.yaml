  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleFlameShock
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleFlameShock(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Applies Flame Shock spell to a target and returns success status.
  description: The HandleFlameShock method is responsible for executing the Flame
    Shock spell logic within the ShamanAI class. It attempts to apply the Flame Shock
    debuff to a specified target, handling the spell's casting mechanics, damage application,
    and cooldown management. This method integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system
    to ensure proper spell usage according to shaman class abilities and game balance
    rules. The method typically checks for valid targets, spell availability, and
    appropriate combat conditions before proceeding with the spell execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the AI's target list. This parameter determines which unit will receive
      the Flame Shock effect.
  returns: Returns true if the Flame Shock spell was successfully applied to the target,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to invalid targets, insufficient
    mana, cooldown restrictions, or other combat state limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleFlameShock
    code: "int targetId = 42;\nif (shamanAI->HandleFlameShock(&targetId)) {\n    //\
      \ Spell successfully applied\n    printf(\"Flame Shock applied to target %d\\\
      n\", targetId);\n} else {\n    // Failed to apply spell\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to apply Flame Shock\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ShamanAI's core combat logic and should only be
    called during appropriate combat states. The target parameter must point to a
    valid unit within the AI's current engagement range. Implementation assumes proper
    initialization of spell data and resource management.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before calling this
    method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This
    method does not perform automatic target validation beyond checking if the target
    ID is valid.
