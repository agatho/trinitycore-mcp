  brief: Loads and initializes area phase data for the game world
  description: The LoadAreaPhases method is responsible for loading area phase information
    from the database into memory. This functionality allows the game to manage which
    phases of content are active in specific areas, enabling dynamic world events,
    seasonal changes, and phased content delivery. The method typically executes during
    server startup or world initialization, ensuring that all area-based phase data
    is properly loaded and available for use by the game's phase system. It processes
    database entries related to area phases and prepares internal data structures
    for efficient lookup and application during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCustomData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadAreaPhases();\n\
      \    // Area phase data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server initialization or when reloading
    area phase data. It's typically invoked once during startup and may not be safe
    to call repeatedly in a running server environment without proper synchronization.
    The method likely performs database queries and loads data into internal caches
    that are used throughout the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime without proper cleanup
    could lead to memory leaks or duplicate data entries. It's important to ensure
    that area phase data is properly initialized before any gameplay logic that depends
    on it begins.
