  signature: bool AchievementMgr::IsCompletedAchievement(const AchievementEntry *
    entry)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has completed a specific achievement.
  description: The IsCompletedAchievement method determines if a player has earned
    a particular achievement by checking the player's achievement progress against
    the provided achievement entry. This method is typically used during gameplay
    to verify achievement status for rewards, quest progression, or UI display purposes.
    The method performs a lookup in the player's achievement data and returns true
    if the achievement has been completed, false otherwise. It requires a valid AchievementEntry
    pointer to perform the check.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to the AchievementEntry structure that defines the achievement
      to check. Must be a valid pointer to an existing achievement entry.
  returns: Returns true if the player has completed the specified achievement, false
    if not completed or if the achievement entry is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Completion Check
    code: "if (achievementMgr->IsCompletedAchievement(achievementEntry)) {\n    //\
      \ Player has completed this achievement\n    SendAchievementReward();\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Achievement not yet completed\n    ShowIncompleteMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Achievement Manager in Player Context
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nAchievementMgr* mgr = player->GetAchievementMgr();\n\
      if (mgr && mgr->IsCompletedAchievement(achievementEntry)) {\n    // Achievement\
      \ is completed\n    player->ModifyAchievementPoints(10);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal achievement tracking system and assumes
    that the player's data has been properly loaded. The method may perform database
    queries or cache lookups internally to determine completion status.
  warnings: Ensure that the AchievementEntry pointer passed is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be called on players who have loaded their achievement data.
