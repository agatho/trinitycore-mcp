  class: Item
  method: IsRefundExpired
  signature: bool Item::IsRefundExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item's refund period has expired.
  description: This method checks if the refund time window for the current item has
    passed, returning true if the item is no longer eligible for a full refund. In
    World of Warcraft, items can be refunded within a specific time frame after purchase,
    typically 30 days, but this period may vary based on game mechanics and item quality.
    The method is commonly used in conjunction with other refund-related functions
    to manage player inventory and transactional behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item's refund period has expired, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the item can no longer be refunded or returned for a full
    refund.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (item->IsRefundExpired())\n{\n    // Item cannot be refunded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with refund-related functions
    to determine if an item can still be returned or refunded. It's important to note
    that the refund period may vary based on item type and game mechanics, and this
    function does not account for any special refund conditions or restrictions.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of whether an item
    can be refunded; additional checks are required for full refund eligibility. The
    method only returns true when the refund period has expired, not necessarily when
    the item is no longer refundable due to other factors like player inventory constraints
    or game rules.
