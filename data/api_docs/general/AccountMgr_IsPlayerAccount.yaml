  signature: bool AccountMgr::IsPlayerAccount(uint32 gmlevel)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current account has player-level privileges.
  description: The IsPlayerAccount method checks if the account associated with the
    current session holds player-level permissions, as opposed to game master (GM)
    or administrator privileges. This is typically used to control access to player-specific
    features and commands within the TrinityCore framework. The method evaluates the
    account's security level (gmlevel) and returns true if it is below the GM threshold,
    indicating a standard player account.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the account has player-level privileges (i.e., gmlevel
    is less than the minimum GM level), false otherwise. A return value of true indicates
    that the account cannot execute GM commands or access GM-only functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (AccountMgr::IsPlayerAccount(session->GetSecurity())) {\n    // Allow\
      \ player-specific actions\n    SendPlayerMessage(\"Welcome, player!\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Restrict access for GMs or admins\n    SendGMMessage(\"Access denied.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the gmlevel value stored in the account's session data.
    It is important to ensure that this value is properly validated and updated when
    accounts are assigned or modified. The exact threshold for player vs GM levels
    may vary depending on server configuration.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with direct gmlevel
    comparisons, as it abstracts away the specific numeric values. Also, always verify
    that the session object is valid before calling this method to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior.
