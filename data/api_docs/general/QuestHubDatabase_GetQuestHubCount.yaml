documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of quest hubs available in the database.
  description: The GetQuestHubCount method returns the total count of quest hubs stored
    within the QuestHubDatabase. This count represents all active and valid quest
    hub entries that are currently registered in the system. The method performs a
    read-only operation on the internal data structure and does not modify any existing
    data. It is typically used to determine the size of the quest hub collection for
    iteration purposes or to validate the presence of quest hubs before performing
    operations on them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of quest hubs in the database.
    Returns zero if no quest hubs are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "size_t count = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHubCount();\nif (count > 0) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with processing quest hubs\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << count\
      \ << \" quest hubs.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no quest\
      \ hubs exist\n    std::cout << \"No quest hubs found in database.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Quest Hubs
    code: "size_t totalHubs = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHubCount();\nfor (size_t i\
      \ = 0; i < totalHubs; ++i) {\n    // Access each quest hub by index\n    auto\
      \ hub = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHub(i);\n    if (hub) {\n        // Process\
      \ the quest hub\n        ProcessQuestHub(hub);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads concurrently
    without requiring external synchronization. The performance of this method is
    O(1) as it typically returns a cached or pre-calculated count rather than iterating
    through all entries.
