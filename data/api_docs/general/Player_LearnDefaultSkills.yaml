    character creation. It ensures that players have access to essential gameplay
    mechanics such as professions, weapons, armor, and other basic skill sets required
    for normal gameplay operations. The method is usually invoked during player initialization
    or character creation process, ensuring the player has all necessary default skill
    sets before engaging in gameplay activities.

  notes: Implementation details suggest this method is typically called during player
    initialization and may be part of a larger process involving skill set management.
    Performance considerations are minimal as the method simply adds default skills
    to the player's skill list.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where players already have
    existing skill sets, as it might cause conflicts or duplicate skill entries. It
    is recommended to use this method only during character creation or initialization
    phases.
