  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateChatChannel
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateChatChannel(uint32 realmId, bool
    builtIn, bool trade, uint16 zoneId, uint8 factionGroupMask, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a unique ObjectGuid for a chat channel with specified
    properties.
  description: The CreateChatChannel method generates a unique ObjectGuid identifier
    specifically for in-game chat channels. This method is typically used by the TrinityCore
    server to assign persistent identifiers to various types of chat channels, including
    built-in system channels, trade channels, and faction-specific channels. The generated
    GUID incorporates realm information, channel type flags (built-in, trade), zone
    context, faction group mask, and a counter value to ensure uniqueness across all
    active channels in the game world. This identifier is used internally by the server
    for channel management, user association, and network communication.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the chat channel exists.
      This value determines which realm's namespace the GUID belongs to.
  - name: builtIn
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a system-defined built-in
      channel (true) or a user-created channel (false). Built-in channels typically
      have special behavior and are managed by the server.
  - name: trade
    description: Boolean flag indicating if this channel is designated for trade communications.
      Trade channels have specific filtering and visibility rules.
  - name: zoneId
    description: The zone identifier where this chat channel is active. Used to determine
      geographical context and visibility of the channel.
  - name: factionGroupMask
    description: Bitmask representing which faction groups can access this channel.
      Each bit corresponds to a specific faction or group, allowing for fine-grained
      access control.
  - name: counter
    description: A unique counter value used to ensure the GUID's uniqueness among
      all channels in the realm. This is typically incremented for each new channel
      created.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies the chat channel
    within the TrinityCore server environment. The returned GUID contains encoded
    information about the channel type, realm, zone, faction group, and a unique counter
    value.
  examples:
  - title: Create a standard trade channel
    code: ObjectGuid channelGuid = guidFactory.CreateChatChannel(1, false, true, 1234,
      3, 1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create a built-in realm-wide channel
    code: ObjectGuid channelGuid = guidFactory.CreateChatChannel(1, true, false, 0,
      1, 500);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class which manages all GUID
    generation for various game entities. The resulting ObjectGuids are designed to
    be globally unique within a realm and across different realms. The implementation
    uses bit manipulation to encode multiple properties into a single 64-bit value,
    making it efficient for network transmission and database storage.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can result in invalid or conflicting GUIDs
    that may cause channel management issues. The counter parameter must be unique
    per channel to prevent GUID collisions. Using incorrect faction group masks can
    lead to access control problems where players cannot join intended channels.
