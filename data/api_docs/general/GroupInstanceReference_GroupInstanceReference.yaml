documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupInstanceReference object with default values.
  description: The GroupInstanceReference constructor initializes a new instance of
    the GroupInstanceReference class. This class is typically used to manage references
    to group instances within the TrinityCore framework, particularly in the context
    of dungeon and raid group management. The constructor sets up internal data structures
    and default state values necessary for tracking group membership and instance
    associations. It ensures that newly created objects are in a valid, initialized
    state ready for use in group-related operations such as instance locking, player
    grouping, and zone management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupInstanceReference
    code: 'GroupInstanceReference reference;

      // The reference is now initialized and ready for use in group instance management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or external
    lookups. It simply sets up the object's internal state to a default condition.
    Developers should ensure that any necessary additional setup (such as assigning
    group IDs or instance information) is performed after construction.
