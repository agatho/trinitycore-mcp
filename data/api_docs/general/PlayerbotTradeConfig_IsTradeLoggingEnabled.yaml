documentation:
  brief: Determines whether trade logging is enabled for player bot transactions
  description: This method checks the configuration state to determine if player bot
    trade activities should be logged. It returns a boolean value indicating the current
    logging status. The trade logging feature is typically used for debugging, monitoring,
    or auditing purposes within the player bot system. This setting affects all trade
    operations performed by player bots and may impact performance if enabled in high-traffic
    environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if trade logging is enabled, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if trade logging is enabled before performing a trade
    code: "if (playerbotTradeConfig.IsTradeLoggingEnabled()) {\n    // Log the trade\
      \ operation\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot trade logged\");\n}\n// Proceed\
      \ with trade logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration file or runtime setting. The
    implementation may cache the result for performance reasons. Changes to the underlying
    configuration may not be immediately reflected if caching is used.
