  class: Unit
  method: SetLevel
  signature: void Unit::SetLevel(uint8 lvl, bool sendUpdate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the level of the unit to the specified value, optionally sending update
    to nearby players.
  description: The SetLevel method allows developers to change the level of a Unit
    object, which can be a player or creature. This method updates the internal level
    property and can optionally trigger a network update to notify other players in
    the vicinity about the level change. The method is commonly used in scripting
    for modifying NPC behavior or player character levels during quests or events.
    It's important to note that setting a level outside of normal game bounds may
    cause unexpected behavior or visual artifacts.
  parameters:
  - name: lvl
    description: The new level value to set, ranging from 1 to 255. This value must
      be valid and within the bounds of the game's level system.
  - name: sendUpdate
    description: When true, triggers an update packet to nearby players; when false,
      only updates internal state without sending network notifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Level Setting Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      target->SetLevel(60, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Level Setting with Conditional Update
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\nif (target->GetLevel() != 60)\n{\n    target->SetLevel(60,\
      \ false);\n}\nelse\n{\n    target->SetLevel(70, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect the unit's combat behavior
    and appearance. Setting level to values outside standard range (1-255) can cause
    visual issues or game mechanics problems. The sendUpdate parameter controls whether
    network updates are sent, which affects performance in large instances.
  warnings: Setting level to values beyond normal game bounds may cause display issues
    or unexpected behavior. Be cautious when using this method with creatures that
    have specific level requirements for quest completion or combat. Avoid setting
    levels without proper validation to prevent client-side errors.
