  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetPlayerMetrics
  signature: const BGMetrics & BattlegroundAI::GetPlayerMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the metrics associated with a specific player in the battleground.
  description: The GetPlayerMetrics method retrieves the BGMetrics structure that
    contains performance and statistical data for a given player within the battleground
    context. This method allows access to detailed information about a player's contributions,
    such as damage dealt, healing done, and other relevant metrics during the battleground
    match. The returned reference is const, ensuring that the metrics cannot be modified
    through this interface. It is typically used by battleground AI systems or scoring
    mechanisms to evaluate player performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a BGMetrics object containing detailed statistics
    and performance data for the specified player. If no metrics exist for the player,
    an empty or default-initialized BGMetrics structure may be returned, though this
    behavior depends on internal implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Metrics
    code: 'const BGMetrics& metrics = bgAI->GetPlayerMetrics(playerGuid);

      uint32 damageDealt = metrics.damageDone;

      uint32 healingDone = metrics.healingDone;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID corresponds to an active participant
    in the battleground. If the player is not found or has already left the battleground,
    the behavior may vary depending on how the internal data structures are managed.
    The returned reference is valid only as long as the battleground instance exists
    and the player remains registered.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned BGMetrics object through this interface,
    as it is a const reference. Modifying it could lead to undefined behavior or inconsistencies
    in player statistics. Also, ensure that the playerGuid passed is valid and corresponds
    to an actual player currently participating in the battleground.
