  class: Channel
  method: GetName
  signature: std::string Channel::GetName(LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the channel, optionally localized to the specified locale.
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name of a channel instance.
    This method supports localization through the provided LocaleConstant parameter,
    allowing developers to fetch the channel name in the appropriate language for
    the user's client. The returned string represents the canonical identifier used
    by the game's chat system for this particular channel. This is commonly used when
    displaying channel information in UI elements or when processing chat messages
    directed to specific channels.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The target locale for localization of the channel name. Valid values
      are defined by the LocaleConstant enum, such as LOCALE_en, LOCALE_ko, LOCALE_fr,
      etc. If an invalid locale is passed, the method will typically return the default
      (usually English) name.
  returns: A std::string containing the localized name of the channel. In case of
    error or invalid locale, it may return an empty string or the default language
    version of the name.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetChannelByName("General");

      std::string channelName = channel->GetName();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Channel name: %s", channelName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Localized Channel Name Retrieval
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetChannelByName("Trade");

      LocaleConstant locale = LOCALE_ru;

      std::string localizedChannelName = channel->GetName(locale);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Localized Trade channel name: %s", localizedChannelName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as long as the Channel object itself is not being
    modified concurrently. It internally handles locale lookups and caching where
    applicable to improve performance. The returned string should be treated as read-only
    and not modified directly.
  warnings: Be aware that if a channel has no valid localization for the requested
    locale, it may fall back to a default name or return an empty string. Always validate
    the result before using it in critical game logic.
