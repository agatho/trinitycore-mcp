documentation:
  brief: Logs performance statistics for bot priority management operations.
  description: This method collects and outputs detailed performance metrics related
    to the bot priority management system. It typically records timing data, resource
    usage, and operational efficiency of various bot-related processes within the
    TrinityCore framework. The logged information helps developers and administrators
    monitor the performance impact of bot behaviors and optimize the AI decision-making
    processes. This method is usually invoked during profiling sessions or periodic
    performance checks to ensure that bot operations do not negatively affect server
    performance.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore performance
    monitoring system. It may output logs to the console or log files depending on
    server configuration. The statistics collected are usually aggregated over a specific
    time window or operation cycle.
