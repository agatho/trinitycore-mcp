  method: DoCastAOE
  signature: int UnitAI::DoCastAOE(uint32 spellId, const int & args)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a spell in an area-of-effect around the caster unit.
  description: The DoCastAOE method executes a spell that affects all targets within
    a specified radius around the casting unit. This method is typically used by AI-controlled
    creatures to apply area-based abilities such as AoE damage spells, healing effects,
    or debuffs. The spell is cast immediately without any delay, and the method returns
    an integer indicating success or failure of the casting operation. It's commonly
    used in scripted AI behavior for mobs that need to target multiple enemies or
    allies simultaneously.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: args
    description: Additional arguments that may modify the casting behavior or provide
      context-specific parameters for the spell execution.
  returns: Returns 1 if the spell was successfully cast, or 0 if the casting failed
    due to invalid parameters, insufficient mana, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Spell Casting
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->DoCastAOE(12345, 0) == 1)\n{\n    // Spell successfully\
      \ cast\n    Talk(\"Fireball AoE!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AoE with Arguments
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->DoCastAOE(67890, 10) == 1)\n{\n    // Casts a spell with\
      \ argument value of 10\n    me->AddAura(54321, me); // Apply a buff to self\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method bypasses normal spell casting delays and does not trigger the
    standard spell cooldown system. It's intended for AI use cases where immediate
    AoE effects are required. The spell must be valid and exist in the database, otherwise
    the method will silently fail.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid spell IDs or incorrect arguments may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate spell IDs before calling this
    function. Be cautious when using it in high-frequency AI loops as it can cause
    performance issues if not properly throttled.
