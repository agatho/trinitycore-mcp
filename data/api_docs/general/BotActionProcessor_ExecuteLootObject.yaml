  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteLootObject(Player * bot, const
    BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes a loot action for a bot player
  description: The ExecuteLootObject method handles the logic for a bot to loot objects
    from the game world. It processes the specified loot action, determining whether
    the bot should loot items from corpses, containers, or other interactive objects.
    The method evaluates the bot's inventory space, item quality thresholds, and loot
    rules before executing the actual looting operation. This function is typically
    invoked as part of a bot's decision-making cycle when it identifies suitable loot
    targets within its vicinity.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      the loot action
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction structure containing the details of the
      loot operation to be executed
  returns: BotActionResult indicating the success or failure status of the loot operation,
    including any relevant result codes or error information
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot execution for a bot
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player instance\nBotAction action;\naction.type\
      \ = BotActionType::LOOT_OBJECT;\naction.targetGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::GameObject>(12345);\n\
      BotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteLootObject(bot, action);\nif (result.success)\n\
      {\n    // Handle successful loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current inventory state and may modify the
    bot's item collection. It should only be called when the bot is in a valid state
    to perform actions, such as being near a lootable object and having sufficient
    inventory space.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot has proper permissions and that the target object
    exists before calling this method. Improper use may result in undefined behavior
    or client-side errors if the bot attempts to loot invalid targets.
