  class: PreservationEvoker
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void PreservationEvoker::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the preservation evoker's rotation based on the current target and
    spell availability.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate spell rotation for a Preservation Evoker class. It evaluates the
    current target's state, available spells, and cooldowns to decide which abilities
    should be cast next in order to maximize damage output or survivability. This
    method typically integrates with the AI system to make real-time decisions about
    spell usage during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current target of the
      evoker. Must not be null for valid operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyEvokerAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        m_evoker->UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop. It assumes
    that the evoker has valid access to its spell system and target information. The
    implementation may involve checking for spell cooldowns, mana availability, and
    target conditions before selecting a rotation step.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is always valid and not null before calling
    this method. Improper handling of the target can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes in the AI logic.
