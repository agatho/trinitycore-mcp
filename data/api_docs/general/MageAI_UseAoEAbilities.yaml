  signature: void MageAI::UseAoEAbilities(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and executes appropriate area-of-effect abilities for the Mage
    AI based on enemy count.
  description: The UseAoEAbilities method evaluates the number of nearby enemies and
    selects suitable area-of-effect spells or abilities for a Mage AI character. This
    method is typically invoked during combat scenarios to maximize damage output
    against multiple targets. It considers factors such as spell range, mana costs,
    and cooldowns when deciding which AOE ability to use. The method does not directly
    handle spell casting but rather determines the appropriate action based on enemy
    density and available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of enemies currently
      within the AI's detection range. This value is used to determine which AOE ability
      should be prioritized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler(MageAI* ai, const int& enemyCount) {\n    if (enemyCount\
      \ > 3) {\n        ai->UseAoEAbilities(enemyCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Enemy Detection System
    code: "class CombatManager {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(MageAI* mageAI) {\n \
      \       int enemyCount = GetNearbyEnemies(mageAI->GetUnit());\n        if (enemyCount\
      \ > 0) {\n            mageAI->UseAoEAbilities(enemyCount);\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Mage AI has already determined it is in a combat
    situation and that appropriate targeting logic has been applied. The actual spell
    execution is handled by other methods within the MageAI class or through interaction
    with the core TrinityCore AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that enemy count parameter accurately reflects the number of valid
    targets before calling this method to avoid incorrect ability selection. This
    method should not be called in non-combat situations as it may lead to inappropriate
    spell usage.
