  class: WorldSession
  method: SendLfgRoleChosen
  signature: void WorldSession::SendLfgRoleChosen(int guid, uint8 roles)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to the client indicating that a player has chosen specific
    LFG (Looking for Group) roles.
  description: The SendLfgRoleChosen method is used by the WorldSession class to notify
    the connected client about a player's selected LFG roles. This method is typically
    invoked when a player makes role selections in the Looking for Group interface,
    such as choosing to be a tank, healer, or damage dealer. The message includes
    both the player's unique identifier (GUID) and the bitmask representing their
    chosen roles. This functionality supports the game's group finding system by communicating
    player preferences to other players in the same group or queue.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG roles are being
      sent. This is typically the player's database ID used to uniquely identify them
      within the game world.
  - name: roles
    description: A bitmask representing the LFG roles chosen by the player. Each bit
      in the mask corresponds to a specific role type (e.g., tank, healer, damage
      dealer). The exact bit positions and meanings are defined by the LFG role constants
      within the TrinityCore codebase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendLfgRoleChosen
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint8 roleMask = LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_HEALER; // Example: tank and healer
      roles

      session->SendLfgRoleChosen(playerGuid, roleMask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system integration in TrinityCore. The actual
    packet structure and serialization details are handled internally by the WorldSession
    class. Developers should ensure that the roles bitmask passed to this method corresponds
    to valid LFG role constants defined in the codebase.
