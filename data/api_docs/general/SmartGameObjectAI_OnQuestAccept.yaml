documentation:
  brief: Handles quest acceptance logic for smart game objects
  description: The OnQuestAccept method is invoked when a player accepts a quest from
    a smart game object. This method serves as an event handler that allows custom
    behavior to be executed upon quest acceptance, such as triggering animations,
    spawning creatures, or modifying game state. The method provides access to both
    the player who accepted the quest and the specific quest being accepted, enabling
    developers to implement complex quest-related interactions. It is typically used
    within the SmartGameObjectAI framework to extend default quest acceptance functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who accepted the quest. This parameter
      cannot be null and represents the active player performing the action.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was accepted. This parameter cannot
      be null and contains all information about the quest being accepted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic quest acceptance handler
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::OnQuestAccept(Player* player, const Quest* quest)\n\
      {\n    // Play a sound when quest is accepted\n    SendSound(player, 1234);\n\
      \    \n    // Spawn an NPC related to the quest\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        SummonCreature(1234, player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(),\
      \ player->GetPositionZ(), 0, TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN, 60000);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced quest acceptance with conditional logic
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::OnQuestAccept(Player* player, const Quest* quest)\n\
      {\n    // Check if player has required items\n    if (player->HasItemCount(54321,\
      \ 1))\n    {\n        // Grant additional rewards\n        player->AddItem(98765,\
      \ 1);\n        \n        // Trigger custom event\n        DoCast(player, 54321);\n\
      \    }\n    \n    // Log quest acceptance\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %s accepted\
      \ quest %u\", player->GetName(), quest->GetQuestId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI system and should be overridden in custom
    AI implementations. The method is called during the quest acceptance process,
    so any heavy operations should be avoided to prevent performance issues. Ensure
    that all pointers are validated before use.
  warnings: Never assume that the player or quest parameters are valid - always check
    for null values. Avoid performing database operations directly within this method
    as it may cause deadlocks. Be cautious with object destruction during quest acceptance
    events.
