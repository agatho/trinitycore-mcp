documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the calendar
    invite
  description: The GetSenderGUID method returns the globally unique identifier of
    the player who created and sent the calendar invitation. This GUID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to uniquely identify players across the game world and is essential
    for tracking invite relationships. The method provides read-only access to the
    sender's identity and does not modify any internal state. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's calendar system, this allows the game to properly attribute invites
    to specific players and manage permissions accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the player who sent the calendar
    invite. This is typically a unique numeric identifier assigned by the server that
    distinguishes one player from another within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Invite Sender
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = ...; // Assume invite is already initialized\n\
      int senderGUID = invite->GetSenderGUID();\nif (senderGUID > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the invite using the sender's GUID\n    sLog->outString(\"Invite sent by player\
      \ with GUID: %d\", senderGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID value is typically a positive integer that corresponds
    to the player's database entry in the `characters` table. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from immutable data members of the CalendarInvite class.
