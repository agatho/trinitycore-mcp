  class: AuctionHouseBot
  method: Rebuild
  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::Rebuild(bool all)
documentation:
  brief: Rebuilds the auction house bot's internal data structures and resets its
    auction listings.
  description: The Rebuild method in the AuctionHouseBot class is responsible for
    reconstructing the internal state of the auction house bot. This includes clearing
    existing auction listings, recalculating item availability based on current game
    conditions, and repopulating the auction house with new listings according to
    configured parameters. The method can be called with or without the 'all' parameter
    to control whether all auctions are rebuilt or only specific ones. This operation
    is typically used during server startup, configuration changes, or when resetting
    the bot's auction behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: all
    description: A boolean flag that determines the scope of the rebuild operation.
      When true, rebuilds all auction listings; when false, rebuilds only specific
      listings based on current conditions.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rebuild Call
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot* bot = sAuctionHouseBot;

      bot->Rebuild(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Full Rebuild with All Auctions
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot* bot = sAuctionHouseBot;

      bot->Rebuild(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when configuration
    settings are changed. It may cause temporary performance overhead as it recalculates
    and repopulates auction listings. The 'all' parameter controls the granularity
    of rebuild operations, with true performing a complete reset.
  warnings: Calling this method while auctions are actively being processed may result
    in inconsistent auction data. It should be avoided during peak server activity
    or when other systems are actively using the auction house bot.
