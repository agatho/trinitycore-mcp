api:
  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: FindAlternativeTargetLocations
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::FindAlternativeTargetLocations(uint32 targetId,
    const int & currentLocation)
documentation:
  brief: Finds alternative target locations for a given objective target ID and current
    location.
  description: The FindAlternativeTargetLocations method is used within the ObjectiveTracker
    system to determine alternate valid locations for a specified target ID based
    on the player's current location. This functionality supports dynamic quest tracking
    and objective management in World of Warcraft, particularly when primary objectives
    may be unavailable or need to be redirected. The method evaluates available alternatives
    and returns an index representing the selected alternative location. It is typically
    invoked during quest updates or when players interact with objectives that have
    multiple possible locations.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: The unique identifier of the target objective for which alternative
      locations are being searched. This ID corresponds to a specific quest objective
      or NPC target in the game world.
  - name: currentLocation
    description: The current location coordinate of the player, used as a reference
      point to determine relevant alternative locations for the specified target.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the index of the selected alternative location.
    A value of -1 typically indicates that no suitable alternative was found or that
    the operation failed. Positive integers indicate valid indices within the list
    of available alternatives.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find alternative target locations
    code: "int alternativeIndex = objectiveTracker->FindAlternativeTargetLocations(12345,\
      \ playerCurrentLocation);\nif (alternativeIndex >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the alternative\
      \ index to update UI or quest tracking\n    printf(\"Found alternative location\
      \ at index: %d\\n\", alternativeIndex);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No alternatives\
      \ found\n    printf(\"No alternative locations available.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and may be called
    frequently during gameplay, especially when objectives change or become unavailable.
    It's designed to support dynamic quest mechanics where targets might move or become
    inaccessible.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters. Passing invalid targetId or
    currentLocation values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    Ensure that the target ID corresponds to an actual tracked objective before calling
    this method.
