  class: BotProfiler
  method: IdentifyPerformancePatterns
  signature: int BotProfiler::IdentifyPerformancePatterns(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and identifies performance patterns for a specified bot session.
  description: The IdentifyPerformancePatterns method processes profiling data associated
    with a given bot session to detect recurring performance behaviors or bottlenecks.
    It evaluates various metrics such as execution time, resource usage, and response
    latency within the context of the specified session. This method is typically
    used in automated bot testing environments where understanding performance characteristics
    is critical for optimization and debugging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the bot session to be analyzed.
      This value must correspond to an active session previously registered with the
      profiler system.
  returns: Returns an integer code indicating the success or failure of the pattern
    identification process. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while
    negative values may denote errors such as invalid session ID or insufficient data
    for analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IdentifyPerformancePatterns
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nint result = profiler->IdentifyPerformancePatterns(sessionId);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Pattern analysis completed successfully\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that profiling data has already been collected and stored
    for the specified session. The accuracy of pattern identification heavily depends
    on the quality and quantity of available performance metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID may result
    in undefined behavior or error codes. Ensure that the session is active and contains
    sufficient profiling data before invoking this function.
