  class: Player
  method: ApplyModOverrideAPBySpellPowerPercent
  signature: void Player::ApplyModOverrideAPBySpellPowerPercent(float mod, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a modifier to override attack power based on spell power
    percentage.
  description: This method modifies the player's override attack power by a specified
    percentage amount, typically used in game mechanics where spell power affects
    physical attack power. The modification is applied or removed depending on the
    boolean parameter 'apply'. This method is commonly used in conjunction with various
    talent and spell effects that modify attack power based on spell power. It allows
    developers to adjust player's combat performance dynamically during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: The percentage modifier value to apply to override attack power.
      Positive values increase the modifier, negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, applies the modifier; if false, removes it. This parameter
      determines whether the effect is active or inactive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ApplyModOverrideAPBySpellPowerPercent(10.0f, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      float modifier = 15.0f;

      bool apply = false;

      player->ApplyModOverrideAPBySpellPowerPercent(modifier, apply);

      // This removes the modifier from override attack power'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with player's spell power and attack power calculations.
    It should be used carefully during combat simulations or when applying buffs/debuffs
    to avoid unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect attack power calculations,
    potentially affecting combat performance. Care must be taken when applying modifiers
    to ensure they align with game balance requirements.
