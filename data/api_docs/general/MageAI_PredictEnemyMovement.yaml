  class: MageAI
  method: PredictEnemyMovement
  signature: void MageAI::PredictEnemyMovement(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future movement of an enemy target for spell casting optimization.
  description: The PredictEnemyMovement method calculates and stores expected positional
    data of a target unit over a short time period. This functionality is primarily
    used by MageAI to determine optimal spell casting timing, especially for area-of-effect
    spells or projectiles that benefit from anticipating target movement. The prediction
    considers the target's current velocity, direction, and movement type to estimate
    future positions. This method does not directly modify the target's state but
    prepares internal AI data structures for subsequent actions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target whose movement
      is to be predicted. Must not be null and must represent a valid game entity
      with movement capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectBestEnemy())\n\
      \    {\n        PredictEnemyMovement(target);\n        // Subsequent logic uses\
      \ predicted movement for spell targeting\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void MageAI::CastFrostNova()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        PredictEnemyMovement(target);\n        // Use predicted position\
      \ to determine optimal cast point\n        if (IsSpellInRange(FROST_NOVA, target))\n\
      \        {\n            DoCast(target, FROST_NOVA);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal physics simulation or trajectory calculations
    based on the target's movement flags and speed. It may cache predictions for performance
    reasons and should be called before spell casting decisions that require positional
    accuracy.
  warnings: Ensure the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could cause undefined behavior. The prediction accuracy
    decreases over longer time horizons due to potential changes in movement patterns
    or external factors like crowd control effects.
