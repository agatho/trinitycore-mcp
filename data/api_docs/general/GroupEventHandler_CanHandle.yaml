  signature: bool GroupEventHandler::CanHandle(GroupEventType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group event handler can process a specific group event
    type.
  description: The CanHandle method checks if the current GroupEventHandler instance
    is capable of handling events of the specified GroupEventType. This method is
    typically used during event dispatching to filter out handlers that are not appropriate
    for a given event type. It evaluates internal state and configuration to make
    this determination, ensuring only relevant event handlers are invoked. The method
    does not modify any state and is generally called before attempting to process
    an event.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the handler can process events of the specified type; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (handler.CanHandle(GROUP_EVENT_TYPE_UPDATE)) {\n    // Process the update\
      \ event\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Filtering
    code: "for (auto& handler : eventHandlers) {\n    if (handler.CanHandle(eventType))\
      \ {\n        handler.Handle(event);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with event routing systems where
    multiple handlers may exist for different types of events. It's important to note
    that the return value should be consistent during the lifetime of an event handler
    instance.
