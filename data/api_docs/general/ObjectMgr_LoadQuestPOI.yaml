documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes quest point of interest (POI) data from the database
    into memory for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadQuestPOI method initializes and loads all quest point of interest
    (POI) records from the database into the ObjectMgr's internal data structures.
    These POIs define specific locations in the game world that are associated with
    quests, such as quest givers, objectives, or interactive points. The method typically
    runs during server startup or database reload operations to ensure that quest-related
    location markers are properly available for player interaction and quest tracking.
    It processes data from the 'quest_poi' and related tables, mapping them to in-game
    coordinates and quest associations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadQuestPOI()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadQuestPOI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reloads.
    It should only be invoked after the database connection is established and the
    relevant tables are populated with quest POI data. The loaded POIs are cached
    in memory for fast access during gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate POI entries. Ensure that any existing POI data is cleared before reloading
    to prevent memory leaks or duplicate entries.
