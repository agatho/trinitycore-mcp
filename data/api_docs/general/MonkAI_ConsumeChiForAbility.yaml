  class: MonkAI
  method: ConsumeChiForAbility
  signature: void MonkAI::ConsumeChiForAbility(int spellId, int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of chi for a given monk ability.
  description: The ConsumeChiForAbility method reduces the current chi resource of
    a monk AI by the specified amount when executing a particular spell or ability.
    This method is typically invoked during ability activation to ensure proper resource
    management according to game mechanics. The method does not validate whether sufficient
    chi exists before consumption, so it should be called only when chi availability
    has been confirmed. It directly modifies the internal chi state of the MonkAI
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability being consumed. Used
      to determine which ability's chi cost is applied.
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of chi to consume. Must be a non-negative integer representing
      the resource cost of the ability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Consumption for a Monk Ability
    code: monkAI->ConsumeChiForAbility(12345, 1); // Consumes 1 chi for ability with
      ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Chi Based on Ability Configuration
    code: 'int chiCost = GetSpellChiCost(abilityId);

      monkAI->ConsumeChiForAbility(abilityId, chiCost);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spellId corresponds to a valid monk ability
    with an associated chi cost. It is recommended to verify chi availability prior
    to calling this method to prevent negative chi values.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for sufficient chi may result in
    invalid resource states. Ensure that all calls are made within the context of
    a valid ability activation sequence.
