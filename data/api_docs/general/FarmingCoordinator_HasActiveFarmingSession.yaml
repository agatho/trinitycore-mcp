  method: HasActiveFarmingSession
  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::HasActiveFarmingSession(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active farming session.
  description: The HasActiveFarmingSession method determines whether a specified player
    currently has an active farming session in progress. This method is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's farming mechanics, where players
    can engage in activities such as tending to crops or managing livestock. The method
    returns true if the player is actively engaged in a farming-related activity and
    false otherwise. It may be used for various purposes including preventing duplicate
    sessions, enforcing cooldowns, or determining eligibility for certain farming
    rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which specific player's farming session
      status should be checked.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has an active farming session; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (farmingCoordinator->HasActiveFarmingSession(&playerId))\
      \ {\n    // Player is currently farming\n    printf(\"Player %d is actively\
      \ farming\\n\", playerId);\n} else {\n    // No active farming session\n   \
      \ printf(\"Player %d is not farming\\n\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Management
    code: "class PlayerManager {\npublic:\n    bool IsPlayerFarming(int playerId)\
      \ {\n        return farmingCoordinator->HasActiveFarmingSession(&playerId);\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// Usage\nPlayerManager manager;\nint playerGuid = 54321;\nif\
      \ (manager.IsPlayerFarming(playerGuid)) {\n    // Prevent starting new farming\
      \ session\n    SendErrorMessage(\"You already have an active farming session.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in an internal data structure that tracks
    active farming sessions. It's important to note that the player parameter is passed
    by reference, which implies that the method may modify or validate the GUID value
    during execution. The implementation should be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded
    environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID provided is valid and represents an actual
    online player. Passing invalid or uninitialized values could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results.
