  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: ReleaseConnection
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::ReleaseConnection(size_t connectionIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a database connection back to the pool for reuse.
  description: The ReleaseConnection method returns a previously acquired database
    connection to the BotDatabasePool, making it available for other components to
    use. This method is typically called after completing database operations to ensure
    proper resource management and prevent connection leaks. The connection index
    parameter identifies which specific connection in the pool should be released.
    Proper usage of this method ensures efficient database connection handling and
    optimal performance within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: connectionIndex
    description: The zero-based index identifying which connection in the pool to
      release. This index must correspond to a valid connection that was previously
      acquired from the pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Connection Release
    code: 'BotDatabasePool& pool = BotDatabasePool::Instance();

      size_t connectionIndex = pool.AcquireConnection();

      // Perform database operations...

      pool.ReleaseConnection(connectionIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Thread-Safe Connection Management
    code: "BotDatabasePool& pool = BotDatabasePool::Instance();\nsize_t connectionIndex\
      \ = pool.AcquireConnection();\n// Perform thread-safe database operations...\n\
      {   // Scope for automatic cleanup\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(pool.GetMutex());\n\
      \    pool.ReleaseConnection(connectionIndex);\n} // Connection automatically\
      \ released"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a connection pooling mechanism designed to reduce
    the overhead of creating and destroying database connections. The pool maintains
    a fixed number of active connections that can be acquired and released as needed.
    It's important to always release connections back to the pool to maintain optimal
    resource utilization.
  warnings: Failing to call ReleaseConnection after acquiring a connection may lead
    to connection exhaustion, where all available connections are in use and new requests
    must wait or fail. Never release a connection that was not acquired from the same
    pool instance.
