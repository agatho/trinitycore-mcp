documentation:
  brief: Moves resources from another BattlegroundMgr instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources owned by the right-hand
    BattlegroundMgr object to this object. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of battleground-related data structures and internal state
    without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the operation. This method is part of the standard C++ move semantics
    implementation for the BattlegroundMgr class, enabling efficient resource management
    when assigning BattlegroundMgr objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to this BattlegroundMgr instance, allowing for chaining of
    assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'BattlegroundMgr mgr1;

      BattlegroundMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Uses move assignment operator

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment in Function Context
    code: "BattlegroundMgr CreateAndMoveMgr() {\n    BattlegroundMgr temp;\n    //\
      \ ... initialize temp ...\n    return temp; // Move semantics used in return\n\
      }\n\nBattlegroundMgr mgr = CreateAndMoveMgr(); // Move assignment used here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically generated by the compiler when a class has move
    constructors and move assignment operators. It's important to note that after
    move assignment, the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its
    state is left in a valid but unspecified condition. The implementation likely
    transfers internal pointers or handles rather than copying data structures.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior if the class does not properly handle such cases. Always ensure that
    objects are not used after being moved from, and be aware that move operations
    may leave source objects in a valid but unspecified state.
