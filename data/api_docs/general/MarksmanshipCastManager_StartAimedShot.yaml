  class: MarksmanshipCastManager
  method: StartAimedShot
  signature: void MarksmanshipCastManager::StartAimedShot(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Aimed Shot spell cast for a marksman hunter.
  description: The StartAimedShot method begins the casting process for the Aimed
    Shot ability, which is a key marksmanship talent in World of Warcraft. This method
    likely handles the initial setup and state transition required to begin casting
    the spell, including updating the hunter's casting state, validating target eligibility,
    and potentially triggering any necessary visual or audio effects. The method operates
    on a target parameter that specifies which enemy unit should be the focus of the
    aimed shot. It is typically invoked during combat when the player intends to execute
    this specific ability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the game world. This parameter specifies which unit the Aimed Shot should
      be cast upon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of StartAimedShot
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      marksmanshipManager->StartAimedShot(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MarksmanshipCastManager class, which manages the
    casting behavior for hunter marksmanship abilities. The target parameter must
    point to a valid enemy unit in the game world; otherwise, the spell may fail or
    have undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing an invalid target ID could result in failed spell
    casts or potential client/server synchronization issues. Ensure that the target
    is a valid hostile unit before calling this method.
