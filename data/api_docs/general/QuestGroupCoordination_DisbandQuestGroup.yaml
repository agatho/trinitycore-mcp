  signature: void QuestGroupCoordination::DisbandQuestGroup(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Disbands a quest group associated with the specified quest ID.
  description: The DisbandQuestGroup method removes and cleans up all members from
    a quest group that was previously formed for the given quest ID. This operation
    typically occurs when a player's quest group is no longer needed, such as when
    the quest is completed or abandoned. The method ensures that all players in the
    group are properly removed from the group state and their individual quest tracking
    is updated accordingly. It also handles cleanup of any temporary data structures
    associated with the quest group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disband a Quest Group
    code: QuestGroupCoordination::instance()->DisbandQuestGroup(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest group for the specified quest ID exists
    and is active. It should only be called when it's certain that all players in
    the group are no longer participating in the quest. The method does not validate
    whether the quest is actually completed or abandoned; it simply removes the group
    members.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the quest group exists may
    lead to undefined behavior. It is recommended to check for the existence of a
    quest group before calling this method to avoid potential errors or inconsistencies
    in player state tracking.
