documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current LFG state of the player
  description: The GetState method returns the current Looking for Group (LFG) state
    of the player, which indicates their participation status in LFG activities. This
    state determines whether the player is in a queued state, waiting for a group,
    or has been matched with a group. The returned LfgState value can be used to determine
    the appropriate UI elements to display and how to handle player interactions within
    the LFG system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an LfgState enum value representing the current state of the player's
    LFG participation. Possible values include LFG_STATE_NONE, LFG_STATE_ROLECHECK,
    LFG_STATE_QUEUED, LFG_STATE_PROPOSAL, LFG_STATE_SUMMON, LFG_STATE_GROUP, and LFG_STATE_FINISHED.
  examples:
  - title: Check player's LFG state
    code: "LfgState state = player->GetSession()->GetLfgPlayerData()->GetState();\n\
      if (state == LFG_STATE_QUEUED)\n{\n    // Player is currently queued for a group\n\
      \    SendQueueStatusMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the player's current LFG state at the
    time of invocation. The state may change frequently as players join/leave groups
    or are matched with other players. The returned value should not be cached for
    extended periods without checking for updates.
