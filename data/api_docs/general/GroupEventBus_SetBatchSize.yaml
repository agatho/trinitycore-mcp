  method: SetBatchSize
  signature: void GroupEventBus::SetBatchSize(uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum batch size for group events processing in the GroupEventBus.
  description: The SetBatchSize method configures the maximum number of events that
    can be processed together in a single batch within the GroupEventBus. This setting
    affects how events are grouped and handled during processing, potentially impacting
    performance and resource usage. The batch size determines the threshold at which
    events are flushed for processing rather than being held until more events accumulate.
    This method is typically used to optimize event handling based on system resources
    or desired responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of events to include in a single batch. Must be
      a positive integer value representing the batch capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Batch Size for Optimal Performance
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = new GroupEventBus();

      // Configure batch size to process up to 100 events at once

      eventBus->SetBatchSize(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Batch Size Based on System Load
    code: "GroupEventBus* eventBus = GroupEventBus::GetInstance();\n// Reduce batch\
      \ size during high load to prevent memory spikes\nif (systemLoad > HIGH_THRESHOLD)\n\
      {\n    eventBus->SetBatchSize(50);\n}\nelse\n{\n    eventBus->SetBatchSize(200);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate the input size parameter, so developers should
    ensure that the provided value is appropriate for their use case. Setting an excessively
    large batch size may lead to memory pressure or delayed event processing, while
    a very small batch size could increase overhead from frequent processing operations.
  warnings: Modifying the batch size while events are actively being processed may
    result in inconsistent behavior or dropped events. It's recommended to set the
    batch size before starting event processing or during maintenance windows when
    no active events are pending.
