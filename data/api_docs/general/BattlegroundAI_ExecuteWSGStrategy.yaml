  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: ExecuteWSGStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::ExecuteWSGStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the WSG (Warsong Gulch) strategy for a given player in the battleground.
  description: The ExecuteWSGStrategy method is responsible for applying specific
    game logic and behaviors related to the Warsong Gulch battleground type. This
    method likely handles objectives, scoring, and player actions unique to WSG such
    as capturing flags or defending bases. It operates on a provided player reference
    and modifies their state according to WSG rules. The method is typically invoked
    during battleground updates or when specific events occur within the WSG context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the battleground. This value is used to determine which player's state
      should be updated according to WSG strategy rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground update loop
    code: "void BattlegroundWS::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other code ...\n\
      \    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PLAYERS; ++i)\n    {\n        if (m_players[i]\
      \ > 0)\n            ExecuteWSGStrategy(&m_players[i]);\n    }\n    // ... other\
      \ code ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    within the context of a Warsong Gulch battleground instance. It assumes that the
    player reference passed in is valid and corresponds to an active player in the
    battleground.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player index before
    calling this method, as invalid references may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method modifies player state directly and should not be called concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
