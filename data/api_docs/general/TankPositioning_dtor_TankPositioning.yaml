  method: ~TankPositioning
  signature: void TankPositioning::~TankPositioning()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TankPositioning instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the TankPositioning class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method is automatically invoked when a TankPositioning object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and
    positioning systems, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of any internal data
    structures related to tank positioning logic, such as cached positions, movement
    paths, or references to game entities. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    TankPositioning positioning;\n    // Use positioning\
      \ object...\n    // Destructor called automatically when positioning goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion Example
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    TankPositioning* positioning = new TankPositioning();\n\
      \    // Use positioning object...\n    delete positioning; // Triggers destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing
    low-level memory management or custom object lifecycle control. Ensure that no
    other objects hold references to members of this class after destruction to prevent
    dangling pointer issues.
