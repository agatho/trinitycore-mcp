  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: JustSummoned
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::JustSummoned(Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature is summoned by this game object AI.
  description: The JustSummoned method is invoked by the SmartGameObjectAI framework
    when a Creature is successfully summoned through this game object's AI behavior.
    This method allows developers to implement custom logic that should execute immediately
    after a summoning event occurs, such as initializing summoned creatures, setting
    their AI states, or triggering related events. The method is part of the SmartAI
    system which provides enhanced scripting capabilities for game objects in TrinityCore.
    It is typically used in conjunction with summoning-based quest objectives or scripted
    encounters where specific actions need to be taken upon successful creature summoning.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that was summoned. This parameter
      provides access to all properties and methods of the summoned creature, allowing
      for manipulation of its behavior, stats, or state.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Summoned Creature Initialization
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::JustSummoned(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature)\n\
      \    {\n        // Set the summoned creature to follow the game object\n   \
      \     creature->SetFaction(FACTION_HOSTILE);\n        creature->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering Events on Summon
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::JustSummoned(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature\
      \ && creature->GetEntry() == NPC_SUMMONED_BOSS)\n    {\n        // Trigger a\
      \ sound effect when boss is summoned\n        creature->PlayDirectSound(SOUND_BOSS_SUMMONED);\n\
      \        \n        // Set AI behavior for the summoned boss\n        creature->SetAI(new\
      \ BossAI(creature));\n        \n        // Start combat immediately\n      \
      \  creature->AI()->AttackStart(me);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the SmartAI framework's internal event
    handling system. Developers should ensure that any modifications to summoned creatures
    do not cause performance issues or infinite loops. The creature pointer passed
    to this method is guaranteed to be valid at the time of invocation, but it may
    become invalid if the creature is despawned or destroyed before other AI events
    occur.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this
    method as it's called synchronously during AI processing. Do not attempt to delete
    or modify the creature object directly from this method unless you are certain
    of the implications, as it may lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
