  class: EscortAI
  method: Start
  signature: void EscortAI::Start(bool isActiveAttacker, int playerGUID, const Quest
    * quest, bool instantRespawn, bool canLoopPath)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the escort AI behavior for a creature, configuring its attack state,
    player target, quest association, and path settings.
  description: The Start method initializes the EscortAI system for a creature, setting
    up the necessary parameters to begin escorting a player. It configures whether
    the creature will actively attack enemies during the escort, assigns the player
    GUID as the target, associates a specific quest with the escort, and sets options
    for respawn behavior and path looping. This method is typically called when an
    NPC begins escorting a player through a quest, such as during a 'Escort' quest
    type in World of Warcraft. The method prepares the AI state machine to handle
    movement, combat, and quest-related events based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: isActiveAttacker
    description: If true, the creature will engage in combat with hostile NPCs during
      the escort. If false, it will remain passive unless provoked.
  - name: playerGUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is being escorted.
      This identifies which player the creature should follow and protect.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object associated with this escort. Used for
      quest completion tracking and event handling during the escort.
  - name: instantRespawn
    description: If true, the creature will respawn immediately after death during
      the escort. If false, it will follow normal respawn behavior.
  - name: canLoopPath
    description: If true, the creature will loop back to the beginning of its patrol
      path when reaching the end. If false, it will stop at the final point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Escort Start
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345) {\n        me->GetAI()->Start(true, player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ quest);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Passive Escort with Looping Path
    code: "void StartEscortWithLoop() {\n    // Start an escort without active combat,\
      \ with looping path\n    me->GetAI()->Start(false, playerGUID, quest, false,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only after the creature's AI has been properly
    initialized. The player GUID must be valid and the quest pointer must not be null
    for proper functionality. The EscortAI system relies on predefined waypoints to
    function correctly.
  warnings: Calling Start without a valid player GUID or quest pointer can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the creature is in a valid state before
    calling this method, especially if it's already engaged in another AI activity.
