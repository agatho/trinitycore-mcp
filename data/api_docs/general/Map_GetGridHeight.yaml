  class: Map
  method: GetGridHeight
  signature: float Map::GetGridHeight(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, float x, float
    y)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the height value of a grid cell based on phase shift and coordinates
  description: The GetGridHeight method calculates and returns the height value of
    a specific grid cell within the Map class, using the provided PhaseShift object
    and coordinate values. This method is essential for determining terrain elevation
    in World of Warcraft's game world, particularly when dealing with complex phase
    management and spatial positioning. It serves as a critical component for navigation
    and collision detection systems, ensuring accurate representation of the game
    world's vertical dimensions.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The PhaseShift object that defines the current phase state of the
      map, which affects how coordinates are interpreted and processed
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate value used to determine the specific grid cell height
      within the map
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate value used to determine the specific grid cell height
      within the map
  returns: Returns a float value representing the height of the grid cell at the specified
    coordinates, which can be used for terrain elevation calculations and collision
    detection purposes
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float height = map->GetGridHeight(phaseShift, x, y);

      // Use height value for navigation or collision detection'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with phase shift handling
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      // ... initialize phaseShift

      float height = map->GetGridHeight(phaseShift, 100.0f, 200.0f);

      // Process height value for complex terrain calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other grid-related functions
    to determine accurate terrain heights. Performance considerations include the
    use of phase shift objects which may impact processing time when dealing with
    multiple coordinate calculations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect coordinate values
    or phase shift configurations can lead to inaccurate height calculations, potentially
    causing navigation issues or collision detection failures
