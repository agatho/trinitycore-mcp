documentation:
  brief: Copies the contents of another BotWorldEntryQueue instance to this instance.
  description: The BotWorldEntryQueue constructor is a copy constructor that initializes
    a new BotWorldEntryQueue object with the contents of an existing BotWorldEntryQueue
    object. This method performs a deep copy of the source object's data members,
    ensuring that the newly created object has its own independent copy of all relevant
    data. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this constructor is typically
    used when creating new queue entries based on existing ones, such as when duplicating
    world entry configurations for different bot instances or scenarios. The copied
    data may include various queue parameters, entry settings, and configuration values
    that define how a bot should interact with world objects.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotWorldEntryQueue object to copy from. This parameter
      must be a valid, initialized instance of BotWorldEntryQueue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue originalQueue;

      // ... initialize originalQueue with data ...

      BotWorldEntryQueue newQueue(originalQueue); // Creates a copy of originalQueue'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Management Context
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void CreateDuplicateQueue(BotWorldEntryQueue&\
      \ sourceQueue) {\n        BotWorldEntryQueue duplicateQueue(sourceQueue); //\
      \ Copy constructor usage\n        // Use duplicateQueue for new bot instance\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. The method should be
    called with a valid, non-null source object to avoid undefined behavior. In TrinityCore's
    bot system, this constructor may be used when creating multiple instances of similar
    queue configurations for different bots or when cloning existing queue states.
  warnings: Ensure that the source parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this constructor. If the source object contains pointers or references to dynamically
    allocated memory, make sure the copy constructor properly handles deep copying
    to avoid double-free errors or dangling pointer issues.
