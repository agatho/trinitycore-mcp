  method: ValidateSpellScripts
  signature: void ObjectMgr::ValidateSpellScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Validates all spell scripts registered in the object manager to ensure their
    correctness and compatibility.
  description: The ValidateSpellScripts method performs a comprehensive validation
    of all spell scripts currently loaded within the ObjectMgr. This function checks
    for proper script registration, verifies that required spell script functions
    exist, and ensures that spell scripts are correctly linked to their corresponding
    spells. It is typically invoked during server startup or when reloading spell
    data to prevent runtime errors caused by invalid or mismatched spell scripts.
    The method helps maintain game stability by identifying problematic spell implementations
    before they can cause issues in gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sObjectMgr->ValidateSpellScripts();\n\
      \    // Continue with server startup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during server boot-up and configuration reloads.
    It performs checks that may impact startup time, especially with a large number
    of spells. The validation process includes checking for missing or incorrectly
    implemented spell script functions, ensuring proper linking between spells and
    their scripts, and verifying that all required dependencies are present.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay can cause performance degradation
    as it validates all loaded spell scripts. It should only be used during server
    initialization or maintenance windows when the game is not actively running.
