  class: AreaTrigger
  method: BuildValuesCreate
  signature: void AreaTrigger::BuildValuesCreate(int * data, int flags, const int
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates the data array with create packet values for an area trigger.
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for constructing the initial
    data values that are sent to clients when an AreaTrigger object is created. This
    method prepares the necessary field data including position, size, and other relevant
    properties required for the client to properly render and handle the area trigger.
    It is typically invoked during the creation of area trigger game objects and ensures
    that all relevant information is serialized into a format suitable for network
    transmission to connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the constructed create packet values
      will be stored. This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold
      all required field values.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which fields should be included in the
      data packet. These flags control the serialization behavior and can indicate
      various object states or visibility settings.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing target information for the
      area trigger. This may include reference IDs or other identifying data used
      to establish relationships with other game objects or entities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesCreate
    code: 'AreaTrigger trigger;

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      int target[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

      trigger.BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal serialization system for area triggers
    in TrinityCore. Developers should ensure that the data buffer passed to this method
    is large enough to accommodate all required fields. The exact field layout and
    interpretation depends on the current game protocol version and client expectations.
  warnings: Incorrectly sized data arrays or improper flag usage may result in undefined
    behavior or client-side errors. This method should only be called during object
    initialization or when sending create packets to clients, not during regular gameplay
    updates.
