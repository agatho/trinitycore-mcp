  class: Loot
  method: GetGUID
  signature: const int & Loot::GetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the loot object.
  description: The GetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier associated
    with a Loot object. In the context of TrinityCore and World of Warcraft, this
    GUID is used to uniquely identify loot instances within the game world. The returned
    value represents the internal identifier that can be used to reference or track
    specific loot items across different systems and functions. This method is typically
    called when interacting with loot systems, such as retrieving loot from creatures,
    players, or containers. It's important to note that the GUID returned by this
    method is consistent for the lifetime of the Loot object and should not be modified
    externally.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the Loot object. This value uniquely identifies the loot instance within the
    game world and can be used for tracking, referencing, or comparison purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();

      const int& guid = loot->GetGUID();

      printf("Loot GUID: %d\n", guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Loot Tracking
    code: "void HandleLootUpdate(Player* player) {\n    Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();\n\
      \    if (loot) {\n        const int& lootGuid = loot->GetGUID();\n        //\
      \ Use lootGuid to track or reference this specific loot instance\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Tracking loot with GUID: %d\", lootGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a const reference to ensure the GUID cannot be modified
    through this interface. The GUID value is typically assigned when the Loot object
    is created and remains constant during its lifetime. This method is thread-safe
    as long as the Loot object itself is not being modified concurrently by other
    threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the Loot object being queried is valid before calling GetGUID,
    as accessing a null Loot object could lead to undefined behavior. The returned
    reference should not be stored beyond the lifetime of the Loot object unless proper
    ownership semantics are maintained.
