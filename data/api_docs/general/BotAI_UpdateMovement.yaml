documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement behavior of a bot AI instance based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateMovement method is responsible for processing and updating
    the movement logic of a bot AI character within the TrinityCore framework. It
    takes a time delta (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since
    the last update, allowing the bot to adjust its pathfinding, positioning, and
    navigation behaviors accordingly. This method is typically called during the AI
    update cycle and integrates with the game's movement system to ensure bots move
    realistically within the world. The implementation likely handles path recalculation,
    obstacle avoidance, and target following mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateMovement Call
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateMovement(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Process movement updates\
      \ based on time delta\n    if (m_bot->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        m_bot->UpdatePosition();\n\
      \        m_bot->MoveToTarget();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the AI update loop.
    It should not block or perform heavy operations that could affect game performance.
    The time delta (diff) parameter represents milliseconds since last update and
    should be used for smooth, time-based movement calculations.
