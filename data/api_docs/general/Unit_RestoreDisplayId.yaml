documentation:
  brief: Restores the original display ID of a unit after it has been modified by
    a mount or other visual changes.
  description: The RestoreDisplayId method is used to reset a Unit's display ID back
    to its original state, effectively undoing any visual modifications caused by
    mounts, transformations, or other gameplay effects. This method is particularly
    useful when dealing with units that have been altered through various game mechanics
    such as mounting, shape-shifting, or temporary visual changes. It ensures that
    the unit returns to its base appearance, which is important for maintaining proper
    game state and avoiding visual inconsistencies in the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->RestoreDisplayId();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically requires that the unit be in a state where it can properly
    restore its display ID. It may not work correctly if the unit is currently in
    an invalid state or if certain conditions prevent restoration, such as being in
    combat or having active effects that prevent display changes.
  warnings: This method should not be used during combat or when other visual effects
    are actively influencing the unit's appearance. Using it at inappropriate times
    may lead to visual inconsistencies or unexpected behavior in the game world.
