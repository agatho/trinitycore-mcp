  signature: void Map::DeleteCorpseData()
documentation:
  brief: Deletes corpse data associated with the map.
  description: The DeleteCorpseData method removes all corpse-related information
    from the map instance. This includes cleaning up any stored corpse positions,
    loot data, and associated player corpse records that are no longer needed. The
    method is typically invoked when a map is being unloaded or destroyed to prevent
    memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of corpse-related resources. It's an essential
    part of the game's resource management system, particularly in scenarios involving
    dynamic map loading/unloading or server shutdowns.

  - title: Basic Usage During Map Cleanup
    code: "void MyMapManager::UnloadMap(Map* map)\n{\n    if (map)\n    {\n      \
      \  map->DeleteCorpseData();\n        // Proceed with other cleanup operations\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the map is no longer in use to avoid
    potential access violations or data corruption. It's recommended to call this
    before destroying a Map instance to ensure all corpse-related data is properly
    cleared from memory.
