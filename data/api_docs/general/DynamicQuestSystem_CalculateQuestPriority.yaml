api:
  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: CalculateQuestPriority
  signature: QuestPriority DynamicQuestSystem::CalculateQuestPriority(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority level of a specified quest for a given
    player bot.
  description: The CalculateQuestPriority method determines the importance or urgency
    of a specific quest for a player bot within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    various factors such as quest completion status, player level, quest rewards,
    and quest chain dependencies to assign a priority value. This functionality is
    essential for AI-driven quest management systems that determine which quests should
    be pursued first by automated characters. The method ensures optimal quest progression
    and resource allocation for bot players in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate. Must correspond to
      a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for whom the quest
      priority is being calculated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns a QuestPriority enum value indicating the calculated priority level
    of the quest. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL depending
    on the evaluation criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "QuestPriority priority = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateQuestPriority(12345,\
      \ playerBot);\nif (priority == QuestPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Handle high priority\
      \ quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Selection Logic
    code: "uint32 bestQuestId = 0;\nQuestPriority highestPriority = QuestPriority::LOW;\n\
      for (auto& quest : availableQuests) {\n    QuestPriority currentPriority = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateQuestPriority(quest.first,\
      \ playerBot);\n    if (currentPriority > highestPriority) {\n        highestPriority\
      \ = currentPriority;\n        bestQuestId = quest.first;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestQuestId\
      \ for bot's next quest action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and may perform database
    queries to retrieve quest information. The calculation considers player level,
    quest requirements, and available rewards. For performance-critical applications,
    caching of results is recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid questId may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    priority calculations.
