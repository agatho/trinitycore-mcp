  method: UpdateFormationPositions
  signature: void GroupCoordination::UpdateFormationPositions()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation positions for all members of the group coordination.
  description: The UpdateFormationPositions method recalculates and synchronizes the
    spatial positioning of all group members according to their current formation
    settings. This method is typically invoked when a group's composition changes,
    or when a leader repositions the group in preparation for combat or movement.
    It ensures that each member maintains their designated role within the formation,
    such as flanking positions, defensive arcs, or centralized formations. The method
    handles internal coordination logic to prevent overlapping or invalid positioning
    states during updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Leadership
    code: "void MyGroupLeader::OnFormationChange()\n{\n    groupCoordination->UpdateFormationPositions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Updates
    code: "void GroupManager::HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player)\n{\n    // Update\
      \ formation when a key member moves\n    if (player->IsGroupLeader())\n    \
      \    groupCoordination->UpdateFormationPositions();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game thread and should
    not be invoked concurrently. It internally manages synchronization between group
    members' positions, so external locking mechanisms are generally unnecessary.
    Performance may degrade if called too frequently during rapid movement or combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method while a group is in combat or under active movement
    constraints might lead to temporary positioning inconsistencies. Avoid calling
    it in high-frequency loops without proper throttling logic.
