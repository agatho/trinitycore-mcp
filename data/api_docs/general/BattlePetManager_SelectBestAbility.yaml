  class: BattlePetManager
  method: SelectBestAbility
  signature: uint32 BattlePetManager::SelectBestAbility(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the best battle pet ability based on player data.
  description: The SelectBestAbility method determines the most advantageous battle
    pet ability for a given player by evaluating various factors such as ability effectiveness,
    cooldown status, and pet statistics. This method is typically used during battle
    encounters to dynamically choose the optimal ability to use next. It takes into
    account the current state of the player's battle pets and their abilities, ensuring
    that the selected ability maximizes combat efficiency. The method requires valid
    player data to be passed in as a parameter and returns the identifier of the chosen
    ability.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the player's battle pet
      data. This includes information such as pet stats, abilities, and current state.
      The array must contain valid data for the method to function correctly.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the identifier (ID) of the selected
    best ability. If no valid ability can be determined, it may return 0 or an error
    code depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerData[10] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000};

      uint32 bestAbility = battlePetManager.SelectBestAbility(playerData);

      // bestAbility now holds the ID of the most effective ability for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetManager class and assumes that the input
    player data array contains valid pet-related information. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific battle mechanics in use, such as pet level, type,
    or environmental factors.
  warnings: Ensure that the player data passed to this method is properly initialized
    and updated before calling. Passing invalid or uninitialized data may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect ability selection.
