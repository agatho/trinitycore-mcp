documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WorldStateScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the WorldStateScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the script instance. This method is automatically invoked when a WorldStateScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    scripting system, this ensures proper cleanup of world state-related data structures
    and prevents memory leaks. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs
    no specific game mechanics operations beyond resource deallocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WorldStateScript instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    WorldStateScript* script = new WorldStateScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~WorldStateScript()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing
    explicit memory management. Since WorldStateScript is likely a base class, derived
    classes may have their own destructors that are called before this one in the
    destruction chain.
