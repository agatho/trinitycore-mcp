  class: Item
  method: SetFixedLevel
  signature: void Item::SetFixedLevel(uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the fixed level of an item to a specified value.
  description: The SetFixedLevel method allows developers to set a specific level
    for an item, which overrides the default level behavior. This is particularly
    useful in scenarios where items need to be assigned a fixed level regardless of
    player or item level requirements. The method affects how the item behaves within
    the game mechanics, especially in terms of item scaling and progression. It should
    be used carefully as it can impact item quality and player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The fixed level to assign to the item. Valid values are integers
      between 1 and 255, representing the item's level in the game context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      item->SetFixedLevel(10);

      // Sets item to level 10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in custom scripts or development environments
    where precise control over item properties is required. It may affect item scaling
    and progression if used in conjunction with other item-related methods.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to items that do not behave correctly
    within the game mechanics, potentially causing issues with item progression or
    player experience.
