  class: Battlefield
  method: OnPlayerEnterZone
  signature: void Battlefield::OnPlayerEnterZone(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player entry into a battlefield zone, triggering relevant events
    and updates.
  description: The OnPlayerEnterZone method is invoked when a player enters a battlefield
    zone. This method manages the integration of players into the battlefield system,
    including updating player states, triggering zone-specific events, and ensuring
    proper synchronization with the battlefield's ongoing activities. It typically
    handles tasks such as assigning players to appropriate teams, initializing battlefield-related
    data structures, and notifying other systems about the player's presence in the
    battlefield. The method is part of the core battlefield management logic and is
    automatically called by the TrinityCore framework when a player's position changes
    into a battlefield area.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who has entered
      the battlefield zone. This parameter must not be null and should point to a
      valid player instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom battlefield implementation
    code: "void MyBattlefield::OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player)\n{\n    // Call base\
      \ class implementation\n    Battlefield::OnPlayerEnterZone(player);\n    \n\
      \    // Custom logic for handling player entry\n    if (player->GetTeam() ==\
      \ ALLIANCE)\n        player->SetPhaseMask(2, true);\n    else\n        player->SetPhaseMask(4,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with event notification
    code: "void AdvancedBattlefield::OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player)\n{\n    //\
      \ Store player entry time\n    m_playerEntryTimes[player->GetGUID()] = getMSTime();\n\
      \    \n    // Notify other systems about the new player\n    sScriptMgr->OnPlayerEnterBattlefield(player,\
      \ this);\n    \n    // Update battlefield statistics\n    ++m_activePlayers;\n\
      \    \n    // Call parent implementation\n    Battlefield::OnPlayerEnterZone(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core game loop when a player's position
    changes. Developers should ensure that any custom logic implemented in this method
    does not block or significantly delay execution, as it may affect performance
    during high-player-density events. The method assumes that the player object passed
    is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not modify the player's position or teleport them within this method
    unless absolutely necessary, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Avoid performing
    heavy computations or database operations directly in this method to prevent potential
    performance bottlenecks.
