documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has maximum renown reputation with the specified faction.
  description: The HasMaximumRenownReputation method determines whether the player's
    current renown level with a given faction has reached its maximum value. This
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's reputation system to check if a player
    has fully progressed through all renown tiers for a specific faction. The method
    evaluates the player's current renown status against the maximum allowable renown
    level defined for that faction. It returns true if the player has achieved the
    highest possible renown with the faction, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in quest systems, achievement checks, and UI elements that display
    reputation progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has maximum renown reputation with the specified
    faction; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check renown status
    code: "if (player->GetReputationMgr()->HasMaximumRenownReputation(factionEntry))\n\
      {\n    // Player has reached maximum renown\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have\
      \ achieved maximum renown with this faction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal reputation tracking systems and
    may depend on the faction's renown tier configuration. The method assumes that
    the factionEntry parameter is valid and properly initialized.
