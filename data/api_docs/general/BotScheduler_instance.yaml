documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotScheduler class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotScheduler
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the scheduler exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access the global bot scheduling
    manager that handles AI behavior, quest management, and other automated tasks
    for player-controlled bots in TrinityCore. The returned pointer should be used
    directly without attempting to delete or manage its lifetime, as it's managed
    internally by the singleton implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotScheduler instance. The method will always return
    a valid pointer to the singleton instance; it never returns nullptr under normal
    operation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotScheduler instance
    code: 'BotScheduler* scheduler = BotScheduler::instance();

      // Use scheduler to manage bot AI behaviors

      scheduler->Update();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BotScheduler in a custom module
    code: "#include \"BotScheduler.h\"\n\nvoid MyCustomModule::Initialize()\n{\n \
      \   BotScheduler* scheduler = BotScheduler::instance();\n    // Register bot\
      \ update handlers or modify scheduling behavior\n    scheduler->AddBotUpdateHandler(&MyCustomModule::HandleBotUpdate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed to be called from multiple threads,
    but the returned instance should not be modified by multiple threads simultaneously.
    The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime
    of the application.
