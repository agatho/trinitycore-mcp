documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is daily or weekly
  description: This method checks if the current quest is classified as either daily
    or weekly, returning true if it meets those criteria. The method is commonly used
    in quest-related logic to distinguish between different types of quests based
    on their time-based nature. It helps developers identify quest behavior and implement
    appropriate game mechanics for daily and weekly quests. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining proper quest progression and ensuring correct reward
    handling for time-based quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is classified as daily or weekly, false otherwise.
    The method will return false for regular quests that are neither daily nor weekly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsDailyOrWeekly()) {\n    // Handle daily/weekly quest logic\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the quest's flags and data structure to determine if
    it is a daily or weekly quest. Implementation details include checking against
    specific quest flags that define daily/weekly nature. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    quest-related functions, as misinterpretation of quest types can lead to incorrect
    reward handling or progression issues. Ensure that the quest object is valid before
    calling this method.
