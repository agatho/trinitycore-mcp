documentation:
  brief: Loads vehicle seat addon data from the database into memory for use in game
    mechanics.
  description: The LoadVehicleSeatAddon method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with vehicle seat addon information retrieved from the database.
    This data is used to define additional properties and behaviors for seats within
    vehicles, such as passenger positioning, animation triggers, and interaction rules.
    The method typically executes during server startup or world loading phases to
    ensure all vehicle seat configurations are available for runtime use. It processes
    records from the vehicle_seat_template table and stores them in an accessible
    format for vehicle-related systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadVehicleSeatAddon();\n    // Continue with other\
      \ systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and should not be invoked
    repeatedly. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast access during vehicle
    operations. Performance is optimized through efficient database queries and in-memory
    storage structures.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started may result in inconsistent
    vehicle behavior or data corruption if existing vehicle instances are already
    active. This method should only be called during controlled initialization phases.
