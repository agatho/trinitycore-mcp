  signature: void WarriorAI::ManageHealthThresholds()
documentation:
  brief: Manages health thresholds for the warrior AI, adjusting behavior based on
    current health percentage.
  description: The ManageHealthThresholds method in WarriorAI is responsible for dynamically
    evaluating the warrior's current health status and modifying its combat behavior
    accordingly. This includes triggering defensive actions, switching to healing
    modes, or activating specific abilities when health drops below certain thresholds.
    The method typically checks if the warrior's health percentage has crossed predefined
    boundaries (e.g., 30%, 50%) and initiates appropriate AI responses such as using
    health potions, invoking defensive spells, or changing target priorities. It is
    part of the core AI decision-making loop that ensures the warrior adapts its strategy
    based on its own vitality.

    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    ManageHealthThresholds();\n    // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The thresholds are usually
    defined as constants or configurable values within the AI class.
