  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: SetSelectedAzeritePower
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::SetSelectedAzeritePower(int tier, int azeritePowerId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the selected Azerite power for a specific tier in the AzeriteEmpoweredItem.
  description: The SetSelectedAzeritePower method assigns a specific Azerite power
    ID to a given tier within an Azerite empowered item. This method is used to configure
    which Azerite powers are active on the item at a particular tier level. The method
    does not validate whether the provided azeritePowerId is valid or available for
    the item, and it simply updates the internal state of the item. This functionality
    is typically used during item creation, modification, or when applying Azerite
    power selections in game mechanics such as Azerite trait selection UI or during
    item upgrades.
  parameters:
  - name: tier
    description: The tier level within the Azerite empowered item where the power
      should be selected. Valid values are typically integers representing the tier
      index (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.).
  - name: azeritePowerId
    description: The unique identifier of the Azerite power to select for the specified
      tier. This ID corresponds to a specific Azerite power defined in the game's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Azerite Power for Tier 1
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);

      item->SetSelectedAzeritePower(1, 67890); // Selects Azerite power with ID 67890
      for tier 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Tier Powers
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AZERITE_TIERS; ++i)\n{\n    item->SetSelectedAzeritePower(i,\
      \ GetRandomAzeritePowerId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the AzeriteEmpoweredItem.
    It is recommended to ensure that the tier and azeritePowerId values are valid
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. The method
    does not trigger any UI updates or server-side validation checks.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid tier or azeritePowerId values may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect item state. Ensure that the provided parameters
    match valid game data entries to maintain item integrity.
