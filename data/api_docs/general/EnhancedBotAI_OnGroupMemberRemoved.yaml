  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnGroupMemberRemoved
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupMemberRemoved(Player * member)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the removal of a group member from the bot's group, updating internal
    state and AI behavior accordingly.
  description: The OnGroupMemberRemoved method is invoked when a player is removed
    from the enhanced bot's group. This method ensures that the AI properly reacts
    to the change in group composition by updating internal tracking structures, recalculating
    group dynamics, and potentially adjusting the bot's behavior or strategy. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining consistent AI logic within dynamic group environments
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds where players frequently join and leave
    groups. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of
    the EnhancedBotAI instance to reflect the updated group membership.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: A pointer to the Player object that has been removed from the group.
      This parameter must be a valid player instance; passing nullptr may lead to
      undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::HandleMemberRemoval(Player* removedPlayer) {\n   \
      \ botAI->OnGroupMemberRemoved(removedPlayer);\n    // Additional logic for handling\
      \ group changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI logic
    code: "class MyEnhancedBotAI : public EnhancedBotAI {\npublic:\n    void OnGroupMemberRemoved(Player*\
      \ member) override {\n        // Call base implementation first\n        EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupMemberRemoved(member);\n\
      \        \n        // Custom logic for reassigning roles or updating strategy\n\
      \        if (member && member->GetGUID() == GetMaster()->GetGUID()) {\n    \
      \        // Master left the group, handle accordingly\n            HandleMasterLeave();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player leaves a group. Developers should ensure that any custom overrides of
    this method do not introduce race conditions or perform heavy operations that
    could block the game loop. The method assumes that the provided Player pointer
    is valid and has been removed from the group before being passed to it.
  warnings: Passing a nullptr for the 'member' parameter can cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the player exists and was actually removed from the
    group before calling this method. Additionally, avoid modifying group membership
    directly within this method unless necessary, as it may lead to inconsistent state
    or infinite recursion.
