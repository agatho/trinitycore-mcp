  brief: Initializes a new PacketPoolManager instance as a copy of an existing one
  description: The PacketPoolManager constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the PacketPoolManager class by copying the state from an existing PacketPoolManager
    object. This constructor performs a deep copy of all internal data structures
    and resources managed by the packet pool, ensuring that the new instance maintains
    identical configuration and state to the source object. In the context of TrinityCore's
    networking subsystem, this allows for proper management of packet memory pools
    across different components or threads while maintaining consistency in packet
    allocation and deallocation behavior. The constructor ensures thread-safe initialization
    when used in multi-threaded environments where packet handling occurs concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copy Constructing a PacketPoolManager
    code: 'PacketPoolManager originalPool;

      // ... configure originalPool ...

      PacketPoolManager newPool(originalPool); // Creates a copy of the original pool'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used when creating thread-local packet pools
    or when duplicating packet handling configurations. The implementation ensures
    that all internal memory allocations and pool states are properly duplicated without
    affecting the source object. This is particularly important in TrinityCore's architecture
    where multiple threads may require independent packet pool management while sharing
    similar configuration parameters.
  warnings: Be cautious when copying PacketPoolManager instances in high-frequency
    scenarios as deep copying of large internal structures may introduce performance
    overhead. Ensure that the source object remains valid during copy construction
    to avoid undefined behavior.
