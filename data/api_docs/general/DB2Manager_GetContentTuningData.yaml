  signature: int DB2Manager::GetContentTuningData(uint32 contentTuningId, uint32 redirectFlag,
    bool forItem) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves content tuning data for a specified content tuning ID, handling
    redirection flags and item-specific logic.
  description: The GetContentTuningData method fetches content tuning information
    from the DB2 database based on the provided content tuning ID. It supports handling
    of redirect flags to determine if the data should be redirected to another content
    tuning entry, and can adjust behavior based on whether the request is for item-specific
    data. This method is used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage dynamic
    content adjustments such as difficulty scaling, loot modifications, and quest
    progression based on player level or instance settings. The method accesses internal
    DB2 data structures and returns an integer identifier that represents the resolved
    content tuning entry.
  parameters:
  - name: contentTuningId
    description: The unique identifier of the content tuning entry to retrieve. This
      ID corresponds to entries in the ContentTuning.db2 file, typically representing
      different difficulty levels or instance configurations.
  - name: redirectFlag
    description: A flag that determines whether to follow redirections when resolving
      the content tuning data. If set, the method may redirect to another content
      tuning entry based on game logic or configuration.
  - name: forItem
    description: A boolean flag indicating if the retrieved data should be adjusted
      for item-specific context. When true, the returned data may include modifications
      relevant to item-level scaling or restrictions.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the resolved content tuning ID after applying
    any necessary redirections and processing based on the 'forItem' flag. If no valid
    content tuning is found, it may return zero or a default value depending on internal
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to fetch content tuning data
    code: "int tuningId = db2Manager->GetContentTuningData(12345, 0, false);\nif (tuningId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the retrieved content tuning ID\n    printf(\"Resolved\
      \ content tuning ID: %d\\n\", tuningId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using redirect flag and item-specific logic
    code: "int tuningId = db2Manager->GetContentTuningData(12345, 1, true);\nif (tuningId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the resolved tuning ID for item-level adjustments\n  \
      \  printf(\"Item-specific resolved tuning ID: %d\\n\", tuningId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 caching and may perform lookups in the
    ContentTuning.db2 file. It is recommended to cache results when frequently accessing
    the same content tuning IDs to avoid redundant database queries. The method is
    thread-safe as long as the underlying DB2 manager instance is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided contentTuningId exists in the ContentTuning.db2
    file, otherwise behavior may be undefined or return invalid data. Incorrect use
    of redirectFlag or forItem parameters can lead to unexpected tuning behavior in
    game mechanics such as loot drops or quest progression.
