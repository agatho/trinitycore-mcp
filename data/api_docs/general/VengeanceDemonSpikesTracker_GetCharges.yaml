  class: VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of charges for the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the current charge count of the Vengeance
    Demon Spikes tracker, which is used in the context of the Vengeance demon hunter
    specialization. This method provides access to the internal state of the demon
    spikes ability, allowing other systems or effects to query how many charges are
    currently available for use. The returned value typically represents the number
    of times the ability can be activated before requiring a reset or recharge. This
    method is const and does not modify any internal state of the tracker object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of charges available for
    the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability. Returns 0 if no charges are currently available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 charges = vengeanceDemonSpikesTracker->GetCharges();\nif (charges\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the demon spikes ability\n    // ... implementation details\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Charges Before Activation
    code: "VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker* tracker = player->GetVengeanceDemonSpikesTracker();\n\
      if (tracker && tracker->GetCharges() > 0)\n{\n    // Activate demon spikes effect\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(player, DEMON_SPIKES_SPELL_ID, true);\n    tracker->RemoveCharge();\
      \ // Remove one charge after use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods like AddCharge(),
    RemoveCharge(), and ResetCharges() to manage the demon spikes ability's state.
    The implementation likely involves a simple internal counter that tracks how many
    times the ability can be used before needing to be replenished.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called on valid VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker
    instances, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, since this is a const method, it should not be used to modify internal
    state, and any changes to the charge count should be handled through dedicated
    setter methods.
