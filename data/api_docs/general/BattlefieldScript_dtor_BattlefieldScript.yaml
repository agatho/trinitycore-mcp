documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlefieldScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The BattlefieldScript destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    resources allocated during the lifetime of a BattlefieldScript object. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring
    proper cleanup of game state modifications made by the script. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when a BattlefieldScript object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and that the battlefield
    system remains in a consistent state after the script's execution has completed.

  - title: Basic Destruction of BattlefieldScript
    code: 'BattlefieldScript* script = new BattlefieldScript();

      // ... perform operations with the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~BattlefieldScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless you are explicitly managing
    object lifetime. In most cases, objects are destroyed automatically when they
    go out of scope or are deleted using the 'delete' operator. The implementation
    assumes that all necessary cleanup has been performed by the time this destructor
    is called.
