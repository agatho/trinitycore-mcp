  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: IsPositionReachable
  signature: bool CombatMovementStrategy::IsPositionReachable(Player * player, const
    int & position) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified position is reachable for a player during
    combat movement.
  description: The IsPositionReachable method evaluates if a given position can be
    reached by a player while in combat, considering factors such as movement restrictions,
    terrain, and game mechanics. This method is typically used by AI systems to determine
    valid movement targets during combat scenarios. It checks for pathfinding feasibility
    and ensures that the target location does not violate any combat movement rules
    or environmental constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the position reachability
      is being evaluated. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: position
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target position. The exact
      meaning of this value depends on the context, but it typically represents coordinates
      or a position identifier within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is reachable for the player during
    combat movement; otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate
    blocked paths, invalid coordinates, or other movement restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (strategy.IsPositionReachable(player, targetPosition)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement to target position\n    player->MoveTowards(targetPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find alternative path or action\n    strategy.SelectAlternativeAction(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat movement validation before executing move
    code: "bool canReach = strategy.IsPositionReachable(player, enemy->GetPosition());\n\
      if (canReach && player->GetDistance(enemy) > MELEE_RANGE) {\n    // Execute\
      \ ranged attack or move closer\n    player->CastSpell(enemy, SPELL_RANGED_ATTACK);\n\
      } else if (canReach) {\n    // Move into melee range\n    player->MoveTowards(enemy->GetPosition());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs pathfinding calculations internally and may have
    performance implications when called frequently. It's recommended to cache results
    where possible in high-frequency scenarios. The method assumes the player is in
    a combat state and respects current movement restrictions.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter is valid and represents a meaningful
    location in the game world. Invalid positions may cause undefined behavior or
    incorrect return values. This method should not be used outside of combat contexts
    without proper validation.
