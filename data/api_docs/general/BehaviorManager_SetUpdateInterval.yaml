  class: BehaviorManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void BehaviorManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 interval)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for behavior management in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the BehaviorManager
    updates its AI behaviors. This interval determines the cadence at which NPC or
    creature behaviors are evaluated and executed. The value is specified in milliseconds,
    with lower values resulting in more frequent updates but potentially higher CPU
    usage. This setting affects all behaviors managed by this specific BehaviorManager
    instance and can be used to optimize performance or adjust responsiveness of AI
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: interval
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are positive integers.
      Lower values increase update frequency and responsiveness but may impact performance.
      Typical values range from 100ms to 1000ms depending on desired behavior fidelity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set standard update interval
    code: 'BehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(500); // Update every 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set high-frequency update for responsive AI
    code: 'BehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(100); // Update every 100ms for more responsive behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal timer used by the BehaviorManager.
    Changes take effect immediately without requiring a restart or reinitialization
    of behaviors. The interval should be chosen based on performance requirements
    and the complexity of behaviors being managed.
  warnings: Setting very low intervals (e.g., below 50ms) can cause significant performance
    degradation in high-traffic areas with many AI-controlled creatures. Avoid frequent
    calls to this method during active gameplay as it may disrupt existing behavior
    states.
