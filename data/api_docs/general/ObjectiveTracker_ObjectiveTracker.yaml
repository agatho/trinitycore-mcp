documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ObjectiveTracker instance for managing quest objectives
    and progress tracking.
  description: The ObjectiveTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ObjectiveTracker class, which is responsible for tracking quest objectives, managing
    objective states, and updating player interfaces with current progress. This class
    plays a crucial role in the World of Warcraft quest system by maintaining the
    state of active quests and their individual objectives. The initialization process
    sets up internal data structures to store objective information, binds necessary
    event handlers, and prepares the tracker to receive updates from the game world.
    This constructor is typically called when creating a new player session or when
    initializing quest tracking systems for a character.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ObjectiveTracker instance
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = new ObjectiveTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track objectives

      tracker->AddQuest(12345);

      // Add quest to be tracked'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ObjectiveTracker constructor does not perform any initialization that
    requires external dependencies or database access. It sets up internal structures
    only and relies on other methods for actual quest data loading. This class is
    typically instantiated per player session and should be properly disposed of when
    the player logs out.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in most cases - it's usually called
    internally by the TrinityCore framework when creating player objects. Manual instantiation
    may lead to incomplete initialization or missing event bindings that are required
    for proper quest tracking functionality.
