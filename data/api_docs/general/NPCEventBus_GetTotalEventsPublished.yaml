  method: GetTotalEventsPublished
  signature: uint64 NPCEventBus::GetTotalEventsPublished() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of events published through the NPC event bus.
  description: The GetTotalEventsPublished method retrieves the cumulative number
    of events that have been published via the NPCEventBus instance. This counter
    is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to track how many events
    have been dispatched within the system. The value is incremented each time an
    event is successfully published, making it a useful metric for performance analysis
    or event tracking in NPC behavior systems. This method is thread-safe and provides
    a consistent view of the event count across different threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of events that have been published
    through this NPCEventBus instance since its initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 totalEvents = eventBus->GetTotalEventsPublished();

      TC_LOG_INFO("npc.event", "Total events published: {}", totalEvents);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Event Volume
    code: "class EventMonitor\n{\npublic:\n    void LogEventCount(NPCEventBus* bus)\n\
      \    {\n        static uint64 lastCount = 0;\n        uint64 currentCount =\
      \ bus->GetTotalEventsPublished();\n        if (currentCount > lastCount)\n \
      \       {\n            TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"npc.event\", \"New event published. Total:\
      \ {}\", currentCount);\n            lastCount = currentCount;\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a monotonic counter that increases with each published
    event. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient for frequent calls, making
    it suitable for real-time monitoring or logging purposes without significant performance
    impact.
