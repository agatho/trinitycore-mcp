documentation:
  brief: Coordinates interrupt management for the Monk AI during combat engagements
  description: The ManageInterruptCoordination method handles the logic for determining
    when and how to interrupt enemy spellcasters as part of the Monk's AI behavior.
    This method evaluates the current combat state, target casting status, and available
    interrupt abilities to decide on optimal interrupt timing. It ensures that interrupts
    are used efficiently while respecting cooldowns and game mechanics such as spell
    interruption rules. The method integrates with the broader MonkAI system to maintain
    proper combat flow and maximize damage output through strategic interruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageInterruptCoordination();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure proper
    interrupt timing. It relies on the AI's target being valid and casting a spell
    that can be interrupted. The implementation may vary based on the specific Monk
    class specialization (Mistweaver, Windwalker, Brewmaster) as different specs have
    different interrupt capabilities.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid combat target or while not in combat
    may result in unexpected behavior. Ensure that the AI has proper state management
    before invoking this method to avoid unnecessary processing.
