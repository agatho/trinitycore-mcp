  brief: Moves resources from another CastSpellExtraArgs object to this instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for CastSpellExtraArgs transfers all resources
    from the source object to the current object, leaving the source in a valid but
    unspecified state. This operation is efficient as it avoids deep copying of data
    members. The method is typically used when temporary or intermediate CastSpellExtraArgs
    objects need to be efficiently transferred into existing instances without unnecessary
    memory allocations or copies. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this
    operator supports efficient management of extra spell casting parameters during
    spell execution and handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CastSpellExtraArgs object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'CastSpellExtraArgs args1;

      CastSpellExtraArgs args2 = std::move(args1); // Uses move assignment

      // args1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Spell Casting Context
    code: "void HandleSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    CastSpellExtraArgs\
      \ args;\n    // ... populate args with spell-specific data ...\n    CastSpellExtraArgs\
      \ extraArgs = std::move(args); // Efficiently transfer to new instance\n   \
      \ // Use extraArgs for actual spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation, which is more efficient than copy
    operations. It's important that the source object remains valid after the move,
    though its contents are unspecified. The implementation typically involves swapping
    internal pointers or moving containers rather than deep copying.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be used in any way that depends on its previous state. Using the moved-from
    object may lead to undefined behavior if it's accessed without being properly
    reinitialized.
