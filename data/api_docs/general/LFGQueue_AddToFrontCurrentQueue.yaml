  method: AddToFrontCurrentQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::AddToFrontCurrentQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player to the front of the current LFG queue, prioritizing their
    matchmaking request.
  description: The AddToFrontCurrentQueue method repositions a player with the specified
    GUID to the front of the current Looking For Group (LFG) queue. This action effectively
    gives the player priority in the matchmaking process, allowing them to be matched
    with other players ahead of those who joined later. The method is typically used
    when a player wishes to expedite their group finding process or when certain conditions
    require immediate attention. It modifies the internal queue structure without
    removing the player from the system entirely.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose position in the
      queue needs to be moved to the front. This value must correspond to a valid
      player in the current LFG queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a Player to Front of Queue
    code: "LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);\nif (lfgQueue)\n\
      {\n    lfgQueue->AddToFrontCurrentQueue(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player with the given GUID is already present
    in the current queue. If called on a player not in the queue, it may result in
    undefined behavior or no effect. The implementation likely involves modifying
    internal data structures such as lists or queues to adjust ordering.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the player is actually in the queue before
    invoking this function. Also, be cautious about frequent use of this method, as
    it may disrupt normal matchmaking flow and could potentially be flagged by anti-cheat
    systems.
