documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotAIFactory class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotAIFactory
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the factory exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access the global bot AI factory that
    manages the creation and configuration of various AI behaviors for NPC bots in
    TrinityCore. The returned pointer provides access to all factory methods and configuration
    options necessary for initializing and managing bot AI components within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotAIFactory instance. The method will always return
    a valid pointer, never NULL, as the singleton pattern guarantees instantiation
    upon first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Bot AI Factory
    code: 'BotAIFactory* factory = BotAIFactory::instance();

      // Use the factory to create or configure bot AIs

      BotAI* ai = factory->CreateBotAI(bot, context);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton implementation patterns. The instance
    is typically created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    Developers should be aware that modifying the singleton state affects all components
    that use it.
