  brief: Initializes the ExampleManager instance and prepares it for use within the
    TrinityCore framework
  description: The OnInitialize method is a critical initialization hook that sets
    up the ExampleManager class for operation within the World of Warcraft server
    environment. This method is typically called during the server startup process
    or when the manager needs to be reinitialized. It performs essential setup tasks
    such as registering event handlers, initializing internal data structures, and
    ensuring all required dependencies are properly configured. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating whether initialization was successful, allowing the
    calling code to handle potential failures gracefully. This method is part of the
    standard TrinityCore plugin lifecycle and should only be called once per manager
    instance during its lifetime.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if initialization completed successfully, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates a critical failure in setup that prevents
    the manager from functioning properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "ExampleManager* manager = new ExampleManager();\nif (manager->OnInitialize())\
      \ {\n    // Initialization successful, manager is ready for use\n    printf(\"\
      ExampleManager initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize ExampleManager\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore Module System
    code: "class ExampleModule : public Module {\npublic:\n    bool OnInitialize()\
      \ override {\n        if (!ExampleManager::Instance()->OnInitialize()) {\n \
      \           return false;\n        }\n        // Additional module initialization\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a manager instance.
    Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is
    expected to be thread-safe and should not perform operations that could block
    for extended periods. It's recommended to implement proper error handling within
    this method as failures will prevent the manager from functioning correctly.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the TrinityCore
    module lifecycle. Improper initialization can lead to crashes or inconsistent
    server state. Avoid performing heavy I/O operations or database queries within
    this method as it may block server startup.
