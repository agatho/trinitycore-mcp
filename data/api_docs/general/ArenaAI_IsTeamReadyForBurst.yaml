  class: ArenaAI
  method: IsTeamReadyForBurst
  signature: bool ArenaAI::IsTeamReadyForBurst(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the arena team is ready to initiate a burst attack.
  description: The IsTeamReadyForBurst method evaluates the current state of an arena
    team to determine if all players are prepared to execute a coordinated burst attack.
    This typically involves checking player readiness, cooldowns, and positioning
    within the arena environment. The method returns true when the team meets the
    criteria for a successful burst initiation, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this functionality is crucial for managing AI behavior
    during competitive arena matches where timing and coordination are essential for
    victory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the index or identifier
      of the player who triggered the readiness check. This parameter allows the caller
      to identify which specific team member initiated the burst condition.
  returns: Returns true if the entire arena team is ready for a burst attack, indicating
    all players have met necessary conditions such as cooldown completion and proper
    positioning. Returns false if any player in the team fails to meet these readiness
    criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (arenaAI->IsTeamReadyForBurst(nullptr)) {\n    // Proceed with burst\
      \ attack logic\n    arenaAI->ExecuteBurstAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Player Identifier
    code: "int playerIndex;\nif (arenaAI->IsTeamReadyForBurst(&playerIndex)) {\n \
      \   // Use playerIndex to determine which player initiated the burst\n    printf(\"\
      Player %d ready for burst\\n\", playerIndex);\n    arenaAI->ExecuteBurstAttack();\n\
      } else {\n    // Team not ready, delay action\n    arenaAI->DelayAction(1000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other AI state management
    functions to ensure proper timing and coordination during arena combat. The implementation
    may involve checking individual player states, spell cooldowns, and positioning
    data within the arena environment.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' should be initialized before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. If the method returns false, it does not necessarily
    mean a burst cannot occur, but rather that the current conditions are not optimal
    for an immediate burst attack.
