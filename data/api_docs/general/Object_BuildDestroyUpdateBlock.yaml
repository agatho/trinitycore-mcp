documentation:
  brief: Builds and populates an update block indicating object destruction for client
    synchronization
  description: The BuildDestroyUpdateBlock method constructs a packet update that
    notifies clients about the destruction or removal of an object from the world.
    This method is typically invoked when an object (such as a creature, game object,
    or item) is being deleted or removed from the game world. It ensures that all
    connected clients are properly informed of the object's disappearance to maintain
    synchronization between server and client states. The method operates on the provided
    UpdateData structure, which accumulates the necessary update information for transmission
    during the next client update cycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Removal
    code: "void RemoveCreature(Creature* creature)\n{\n    UpdateData data;\n    creature->BuildDestroyUpdateBlock(&data);\n\
      \    // Send update data to players in range\n    creature->SendMessageToSet(&data,\
      \ true);\n    delete creature;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's update system and should only be
    called when an object is definitively being removed from the world. It does not
    actually destroy the object itself but prepares the necessary update packet to
    inform clients. The UpdateData parameter must be properly initialized before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an object that is still in use or referenced elsewhere
    may lead to undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure proper object lifecycle
    management before invoking this method.
