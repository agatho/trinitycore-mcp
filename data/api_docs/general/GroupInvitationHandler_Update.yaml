  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: Update
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group invitation handler's internal state and processes pending
    invitations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of group
    invitations within the TrinityCore framework. It processes any pending group invitations,
    checks their validity, and handles the acceptance or rejection of invitations.
    This method is typically called during the game loop to ensure that invitation
    states are properly managed and updated in real-time. The method operates on a
    time-based diff parameter which represents the elapsed milliseconds since the
    last update, allowing for precise timing of invitation processing. It ensures
    that invitations do not remain stale and that players receive timely feedback
    regarding their group membership requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Update Call in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    groupInvitationHandler.Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain proper
    invitation state management. The diff parameter is crucial for accurate timing
    and should represent the actual elapsed time since last invocation. The implementation
    likely handles cleanup of expired invitations and updates player states accordingly.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect timing of
    invitation processing. This method should not be called from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization as it may cause race conditions in invitation state
    management.
