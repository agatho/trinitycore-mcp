  signature: int GameObjectAI::GetDialogStatus(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the dialog status for a player interacting with a game object.
  description: The GetDialogStatus method is used by GameObjectAI to determine what
    type of interaction dialog should be displayed when a player interacts with a
    game object. This method evaluates the player's state, quest progress, and other
    relevant conditions to return an appropriate dialog status code. The returned
    value influences whether a gossip menu, quest offer, or no dialog is presented
    to the player. This method is typically called during player-object interaction
    events and is essential for proper quest progression and NPC/GObject dialogue
    systems in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is interacting with this game object.
      Must be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the dialog status code. Common values
    include: 0 (no dialog), 1 (gossip menu), 2 (quest offer), 3 (quest accept), 4
    (quest complete). The specific meaning of each value depends on the game object
    type and implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation check
    code: "int GameObjectAI::GetDialogStatus(const Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->HasQuest(QUEST_ID))\n\
      \        return DIALOG_STATUS_QUEST_ACCEPT;\n    else\n        return DIALOG_STATUS_NO_DIALOG;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced dialog status with quest conditions
    code: "int GameObjectAI::GetDialogStatus(const Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n        return DIALOG_STATUS_QUEST_COMPLETE;\n\
      \    else if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n\
      \        return DIALOG_STATUS_QUEST_OFFER;\n    else\n        return DIALOG_STATUS_NO_DIALOG;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be overridden in custom GameObjectAI implementations to
    provide specific dialog behavior. The returned status codes are typically defined
    as constants in the TrinityCore codebase. Performance is generally not a concern
    for this method since it's only called during player interaction events.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is valid before using it, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause a crash. Be careful with quest status checks to avoid
    incorrect dialog displays that could confuse players or break quest progression.
