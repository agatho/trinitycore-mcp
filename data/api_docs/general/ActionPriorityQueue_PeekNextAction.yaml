    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the next action from the priority queue without removing it.
  description: The PeekNextAction method examines the highest-priority action in the
    ActionPriorityQueue without dequeuing it. This allows AI systems to inspect upcoming
    actions before deciding whether to execute them or defer them. The method returns
    true if an action exists in the queue and false if the queue is empty. When an
    action is found, it is copied into the provided PrioritizedAction reference parameter.
    This operation does not modify the state of the queue, making it safe for previewing
    actions before processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if there is a next action available in the queue and false if the
    queue is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Check Next Action Before Execution
    code: "PrioritizedAction nextAction;\nif (actionQueue.PeekNextAction(nextAction))\
      \ {\n    // Process the next action without removing it\n    std::cout << \"\
      Next action: \" << nextAction.GetActionName() << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No actions queued.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making loops where the system
    needs to lookahead at pending actions. The peek operation is generally O(1) for
    priority queues implemented with heaps or similar structures, making it efficient
    for frequent checks.
