documentation:
  brief: Performs single-target healing for a Mistweaver Monk based on group assignment
  description: The HandleSingleTargetHealing method executes the core healing logic
    for a Mistweaver Monk class, targeting a specific group member for healing. This
    method is part of the refactored monk AI system and handles the selection and
    application of appropriate healing abilities based on the assigned group parameter.
    The method evaluates target health status, mana availability, and healing priority
    before executing the healing action. It returns true if the healing was successfully
    applied or false if conditions prevented execution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Integer identifier representing the target group for healing. Valid
      values typically correspond to specific group assignments (e.g., 0 for self,
      1-4 for party members, 5-8 for raid members). Values outside expected ranges
      may result in no action being taken.
  returns: Returns true if the single-target healing was successfully executed and
    applied to the target. Returns false if the healing could not be performed due
    to insufficient mana, invalid target, or other execution constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Execution
    code: "MistweaverMonkRefactored monk;\nbool result = monk.HandleSingleTargetHealing(1);\
      \ // Heal party member 1\nif (result) {\n    // Healing was successful\n   \
      \ printf(\"Healing applied successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Healing failed\
      \ or was not possible\n    printf(\"Healing could not be executed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group-Based Healing Loop
    code: "MistweaverMonkRefactored monk;\nfor (int group = 0; group < 5; ++group)\
      \ {\n    if (monk.HandleSingleTargetHealing(group)) {\n        printf(\"Successfully\
      \ healed group member %d\\n\", group);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Failed\
      \ to heal group member %d\\n\", group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the monk's AI state and target selection are properly
    configured before execution. The group parameter should be validated against valid
    group ranges to prevent undefined behavior. Performance is optimized for single-target
    healing operations, but frequent calls may impact frame rate in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the monk's AI context
    or with invalid group values may lead to undefined behavior. The method does not
    perform automatic target selection - it requires a valid group assignment to function
    correctly.
