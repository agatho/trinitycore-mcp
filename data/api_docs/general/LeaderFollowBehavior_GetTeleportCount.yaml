  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetTeleportCount
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::GetTeleportCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of teleport events that have occurred during the
    leader-follow behavior.
  description: The GetTeleportCount method retrieves the cumulative count of teleportation
    events triggered within the LeaderFollowBehavior instance. This count is typically
    used to track how many times a follower has been teleported while following a
    leader, which can be important for quest progression, AI behavior logic, or preventing
    infinite loops in teleportation mechanics. The value is maintained internally
    by the behavior and increments each time a teleport event occurs during the follow
    cycle. This method does not modify any state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of teleport events that have occurred
    since the behavior was initialized or last reset. Returns zero if no teleports
    have occurred yet.
  examples:
  - title: Check teleport count before initiating a new teleport
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->GetTeleportCount() < MAX_TELEPORTS) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with teleport logic\n    leaderFollowBehavior->PerformTeleport();\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent excessive teleports\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Maximum\
      \ teleport count reached for follower.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads internal state without modifying
    it. The teleport count is not reset automatically and must be manually managed
    by the calling code if needed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value for decision-making logic, as it may
    grow indefinitely unless explicitly reset. Ensure that teleportation limits are
    enforced to prevent potential exploits or performance issues in long-running AI
    behaviors.
