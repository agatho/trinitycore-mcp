  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetCurrentObjectiveProgress
  signature: uint32 ObjectiveTracker::GetCurrentObjectiveProgress(Player * bot, const
    Quest * quest, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current progress value for a specified quest objective of a
    player.
  description: The GetCurrentObjectiveProgress method fetches the current completion
    progress of a specific objective within a given quest for a player. This function
    is typically used in quest tracking systems to determine how much of an objective
    has been completed, such as killing a certain number of monsters or collecting
    items. The method takes into account the player's current state and the objective's
    requirements to return an accurate progress value. It is commonly called during
    quest update events or when displaying quest status to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      progress is being queried. Must not be null.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object for which the objective progress is being
      retrieved. Must not be null and must represent a valid active quest for the
      player.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index of the specific objective within the quest. Must
      be less than the total number of objectives in the quest.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current progress toward completing
    the specified objective. This value typically corresponds to the number of required
    items collected or monsters killed, depending on the objective type. If the objective
    is already complete, this value will equal or exceed the objective's required
    count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 progress = objectiveTracker->GetCurrentObjectiveProgress(player,\
      \ quest, 0);\nif (progress < quest->GetObjectiveCount(0)) {\n    // Objective\
      \ not yet complete\n    printf(\"Progress: %u/%u\\n\", progress, quest->GetObjectiveCount(0));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Objectives
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < quest->GetObjectiveCount(); ++i) {\n    uint32 progress\
      \ = objectiveTracker->GetCurrentObjectiveProgress(player, quest, i);\n    printf(\"\
      Objective %u: %u/%u\\n\", i, progress, quest->GetObjectiveCount(i));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest state and may not reflect
    changes made during the same game tick. The returned value should be used for
    display purposes only unless combined with appropriate quest update logic. Performance
    is generally good as it operates on cached data, but frequent calls may impact
    performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. The objectiveIndex must be within bounds of the quest's objectives
    array; otherwise, results are unpredictable. Do not assume that a progress value
    of zero means the objective is incomplete - it could also mean the player hasn't
    started the objective yet.
