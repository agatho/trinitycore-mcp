documentation:
  brief: Constructs a new CorpseReferenceGuard object as a copy of an existing one.
  description: The CorpseReferenceGuard constructor is a copy constructor that creates
    a new instance of the CorpseReferenceGuard class based on an existing CorpseReferenceGuard
    object. This class is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage
    references to corpse objects, ensuring proper lifecycle management and preventing
    dangling references. The copy constructor performs a deep copy of the source object's
    internal state, maintaining consistency in reference tracking for corpse-related
    game mechanics such as corpse despawning, looting, and player resurrection.

  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'CorpseReferenceGuard originalCorpseRef;

      // ... initialize originalCorpseRef ...

      CorpseReferenceGuard copiedCorpseRef(originalCorpseRef); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. The class likely manages
    reference counting or smart pointer behavior internally to prevent memory leaks
    and ensure proper cleanup when corpse references are no longer needed.
