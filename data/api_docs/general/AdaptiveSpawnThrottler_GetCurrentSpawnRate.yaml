  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: GetCurrentSpawnRate
  signature: float AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::GetCurrentSpawnRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current adaptive spawn rate used by the throttler for dynamic
    creature spawning.
  description: The GetCurrentSpawnRate method retrieves the currently active spawn
    rate value that the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler is using to control how frequently
    creatures are spawned in a given area. This value dynamically adjusts based on
    various factors such as player density, server load, and configured thresholds.
    The returned float represents a multiplier or rate factor that influences the
    actual spawning behavior of creatures within the system. This method is typically
    called during spawn cycle calculations to determine whether a new creature should
    be spawned based on the current adaptive rate.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current adaptive spawn rate. This value
    is typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 represents normal spawning rate, values
    below 1.0 indicate reduced spawning frequency, and values above 1.0 may indicate
    increased spawning frequency depending on system configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      float currentRate = throttler.GetCurrentSpawnRate();

      printf("Current spawn rate: %.2f\n", currentRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spawn Rate in Logic
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler* throttler = GetCreatureSpawner()->GetThrottler();\n\
      float rate = throttler->GetCurrentSpawnRate();\nif (rate > 0.5f) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal spawning logic\n    SpawnCreature();\n} else {\n    // Reduce\
      \ or skip spawning due to low rate\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value may change dynamically during runtime as the throttler adapts to
    environmental conditions. The AdaptiveSpawnThrottler likely maintains internal
    state that affects this rate, such as recent spawn activity, player count, or
    system resource usage.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation on the returned value. While
    typically in range [0.0, 1.0], unexpected values could occur if the throttler's
    internal logic is modified or if there are race conditions in rate calculation.
    Always verify that the returned rate is within expected bounds before using it
    in critical spawning logic.
