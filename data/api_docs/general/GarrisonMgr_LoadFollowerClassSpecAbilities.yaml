  brief: Loads and initializes all follower class specializations and their associated
    abilities for the garrison system.
  description: The LoadFollowerClassSpecAbilities method is responsible for loading
    the database records related to follower class specializations and their corresponding
    abilities within the Garrison system. This method ensures that all available follower
    specializations, including their unique identifiers, class associations, and ability
    sets, are properly initialized in memory. It typically gets invoked during server
    startup or when a player's garrison data is being loaded. The method does not
    require any parameters and performs no direct return operations; instead, it populates
    internal data structures used by the garrison manager to manage follower abilities
    and specializations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'GarrisonMgr* garrisonMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetGarrisonMgr();

      garrisonMgr->LoadFollowerClassSpecAbilities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal initialization process for the garrison
    subsystem and should not be called manually unless during specific server load
    phases. It relies on database tables such as `garrison_follower_class_spec` and
    related ability mappings.
