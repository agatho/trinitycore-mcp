  class: Spell
  method: DelayedChannel
  signature: void Spell::DelayedChannel()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a delayed channel spell effect, allowing the spell to be cast with
    a time delay between the initial cast and the actual execution.
  description: The DelayedChannel method is used to handle spells that require a time
    delay between the initial casting phase and the actual execution of the spell.
    This method typically occurs when a spell has a delayed channeling effect, such
    as certain healing or damage spells that require a brief delay before they can
    be fully processed. It allows for proper handling of spell mechanics where the
    spell's execution is postponed, enabling the system to manage timing and sequence
    correctly. The method is often used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to ensure that the delayed channeling behavior is properly implemented within
    the game mechanics framework.

    code: "void Spell::DelayedChannel() {\n    // Implementation details\n    // This\
      \ method handles delayed channeling behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the spell execution process when a
    delay is required for channeling spells. It may involve internal state management
    and timing considerations to ensure proper execution of the delayed spell.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect spell behavior,
    particularly in cases where delayed channeling is expected but not properly implemented.
    Care should be taken to ensure that all related methods are correctly invoked
    during spell execution.
