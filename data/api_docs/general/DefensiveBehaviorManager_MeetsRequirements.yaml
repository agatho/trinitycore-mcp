  method: MeetsRequirements
  signature: bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::MeetsRequirements(const DefensiveCooldown
    & cooldown) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the requirements to use a defensive cooldown ability.
  description: The MeetsRequirements method evaluates whether a player has satisfied
    all necessary conditions to activate a defensive cooldown. This includes checking
    for valid target state, sufficient mana or resource levels, and ensuring that
    the cooldown is not currently active. The method is typically invoked before attempting
    to apply a defensive ability to prevent invalid usage and maintain game balance.
    It serves as a gatekeeper for defensive abilities within the AI behavior system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all requirements are met and the defensive cooldown can
    be applied; otherwise returns false if any condition fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (defensiveBehaviorManager.MeetsRequirements(cooldown)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ defensive ability\n    player.ApplyDefensiveCooldown(cooldown);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::Update()\n{\n    if (MeetsRequirements(defensiveCooldown)\
      \ && !player.HasActiveDefensiveCooldown())\n    {\n        ApplyDefensiveAbility();\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the defensive AI behavior system and should be called
    before attempting to apply any defensive cooldown. It assumes that the DefensiveCooldown
    object passed in contains valid data about the ability being checked.
  warnings: Ensure that the DefensiveCooldown parameter is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    evaluation of requirements.
