    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Destruction Warlock AI bot with the specified player context.
  description: The DestructionWarlockRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the DestructionWarlockRefactored AI class, setting up internal state and configuration
    based on the provided Player object. This method is responsible for preparing
    the AI bot to function as a destruction warlock in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment. It typically configures spell priorities, pet management, and combat
    behavior specific to the destruction specialization. The constructor ensures that
    all necessary data structures are initialized and that the bot can interact with
    the game world using the TrinityCore API.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Get player reference

      DestructionWarlockRefactored warlockBot(botPlayer);

      // The bot is now initialized and ready for combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per AI instance. The Player parameter
    must not be null, as it provides essential context for the bot's behavior. The
    method may perform initialization that requires access to player data such as
    spell knowledge, pet status, and character stats.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure the Player pointer
    is valid before passing it to avoid crashes during initialization.
