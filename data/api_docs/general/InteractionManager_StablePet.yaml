  class: InteractionManager
  method: StablePet
  signature: bool InteractionManager::StablePet(Player * bot, Creature * stableMaster,
    uint32 petSlot)
documentation:
  brief: Stables a pet owned by the player at the specified stable master.
  description: The StablePet method handles the process of stabling a player's pet
    at a creature that serves as a stable master. This operation typically involves
    removing the pet from the player's active control and storing it in the stable
    for later retrieval. The method performs necessary checks to ensure the pet is
    valid, the stable master is appropriate, and the specified pet slot contains a
    valid pet. It returns true if the stabling process was successful, or false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in automated bot behavior where pets need
    to be managed during quests or while the player is away from their character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who owns
      the pet to be stabled.
  - name: stableMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that acts as the stable master, typically
      an NPC that can store pets.
  - name: petSlot
    description: The slot index of the pet in the player's pet list (0-based) that
      should be stabled. Must correspond to a valid pet slot.
  returns: True if the pet was successfully stabled, false otherwise. Failure may
    occur due to invalid parameters, invalid pet slot, or insufficient conditions
    for stabling.
  examples:
  - title: Stable a pet at a stable master
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player\nCreature* stableMaster = ...; // Get\
      \ stable master NPC\nuint32 petSlot = 0; // Slot of the pet to stable\nbool\
      \ result = sInteractionManager->StablePet(player, stableMaster, petSlot);\n\
      if (result)\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player.pets\", \"Pet successfully stabled.\"\
      );\nelse\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"player.pets\", \"Failed to stable pet.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's pet management system and
    may trigger database updates. It assumes that the player has a valid pet in the
    specified slot and that the stable master is within range and functional. The
    method may also perform checks for pet ownership, pet status, and whether the
    stable master accepts stabling.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid Player object with an
    active pet in the specified slot. Passing invalid or null pointers will likely
    cause crashes or undefined behavior. Also, be aware that stabling may have cooldowns
    or restrictions depending on game mechanics.
