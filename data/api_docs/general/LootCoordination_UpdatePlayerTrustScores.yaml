  class: LootCoordination
  method: UpdatePlayerTrustScores
  signature: void LootCoordination::UpdatePlayerTrustScores(Group * group, uint32
    rollId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates trust scores for players in a group based on loot rolling results.
  description: The UpdatePlayerTrustScores method adjusts the trust levels of players
    within a specified group according to their performance during loot coordination.
    This mechanism helps determine player reliability and influence in future loot
    distribution decisions. The method processes the outcome of a specific roll identified
    by rollId, modifying each player's trust score based on factors such as whether
    they passed or failed the roll, and how their actions affect group loot fairness.
    It is typically invoked after a loot roll concludes to maintain dynamic trust
    metrics among group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players whose trust scores
      will be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific loot roll being processed. Used
      to locate and evaluate the roll results for updating player trust scores.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update trust scores after a loot roll
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 rollId = 12345;

      LootCoordination::UpdatePlayerTrustScores(group, rollId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group and rollId are valid and that relevant
    loot roll data has already been processed. It is part of a larger system designed
    to maintain fair and balanced loot distribution among group members.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided group pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, trust
    score updates should be synchronized with the appropriate game state to avoid
    inconsistencies.
