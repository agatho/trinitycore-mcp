  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: GetId
  signature: int SplineChainMovementGenerator::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the spline chain movement generator.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a SplineChainMovementGenerator instance. This identifier is typically used
    to distinguish between different movement generators within the AI system, particularly
    in scenarios involving pathfinding and spline-based movement chains. The returned
    ID is often utilized for tracking, debugging, or managing multiple active movement
    generators simultaneously. This method provides a constant-time lookup of the
    generator's identity without modifying any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier of this SplineChainMovementGenerator
    instance. The value is typically positive and unique within the context of active
    movement generators.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log movement generator ID
    code: 'SplineChainMovementGenerator* movementGen = new SplineChainMovementGenerator();

      int id = movementGen->GetId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Spline chain movement generator ID: %d", id);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object's
    state. The identifier returned by this method should remain consistent throughout
    the lifetime of the SplineChainMovementGenerator instance.
