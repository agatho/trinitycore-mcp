  brief: Destroys a BotSpawnEvent instance and releases its associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawnEvent class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the event object. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures
    proper cleanup when a bot spawn event is no longer needed. It typically handles
    deallocation of internal data structures, resets state variables, and may trigger
    cleanup routines specific to the event handling mechanism within the bot AI framework.
    This destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSpawnEvent
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    BotSpawnEvent event;\n    // ... use the\
      \ event ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when 'event' goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotSpawnEvent pointer
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    BotSpawnEvent* event = new BotSpawnEvent();\n\
      \    // ... use the event ...\n    delete event;  // Triggers destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of memory management in C++. It should
    not throw exceptions to avoid undefined behavior during stack unwinding. Since
    this is a destructor, it's expected that all member variables are properly initialized
    before destruction. The BotSpawnEvent class likely inherits from or uses base
    event classes which also have their destructors called in the correct order.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Always let the normal scope-based cleanup or explicit delete
    handle destruction. If this class manages resources that require special cleanup,
    ensure those are handled properly within the destructor to prevent resource leaks.
