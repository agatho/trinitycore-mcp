documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the HostileEventBus class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the HostileEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the event bus exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is used to access the global event handling
    mechanism for hostile creature interactions within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned reference provides access to all hostile event subscription and publishing
    capabilities, allowing subsystems to register for or trigger events related to
    hostile creature behavior, combat initiation, and threat management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single HostileEventBus instance, enabling direct access
    to its methods and event handling functionality
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the HostileEventBus singleton
    code: 'HostileEventBus& eventBus = HostileEventBus::Instance();

      // Now use eventBus to subscribe to or publish hostile events

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Subscribing to hostile events using the singleton
    code: "HostileEventBus& bus = HostileEventBus::Instance();\nbus.Subscribe<HostileCombatStart>([](const\
      \ HostileCombatStart& event) {\n    // Handle hostile combat start event\n});\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed to be called from multiple threads.
    The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the application
    lifetime, making it suitable for global event distribution across different subsystems.
