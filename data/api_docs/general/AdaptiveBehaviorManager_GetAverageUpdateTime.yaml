  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetAverageUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetAverageUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average update time in milliseconds for adaptive
    behavior management.
  description: The GetAverageUpdateTime method computes the average time taken by
    the AdaptiveBehaviorManager to process updates across all managed behaviors. This
    value represents the typical CPU overhead per update cycle and is used internally
    to adjust behavior execution frequency and resource allocation. The method aggregates
    timing data from recent update cycles and returns the calculated average as a
    32-bit unsigned integer representing milliseconds. This metric is crucial for
    performance monitoring and dynamic load balancing within the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the average time in milliseconds that
    the AdaptiveBehaviorManager takes to complete one update cycle across all managed
    behaviors. A higher value indicates increased processing overhead, which may trigger
    adaptive behavior adjustments or throttling mechanisms.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 avgTime = manager->GetAverageUpdateTime();\nif (avgTime > 50)\n{\n  \
      \  // Log performance warning\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"ai\", \"High average update\
      \ time detected: %u ms\", avgTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during periodic performance checks or when
    adjusting AI behavior parameters. The returned value reflects recent timing data
    and may vary based on system load, number of active behaviors, and complexity
    of current AI tasks.
