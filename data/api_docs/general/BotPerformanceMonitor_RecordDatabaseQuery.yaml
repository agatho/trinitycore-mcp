  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordDatabaseQuery
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordDatabaseQuery(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records a database query execution time in microseconds for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordDatabaseQuery method logs the duration of a database operation
    performed by a bot, measured in microseconds. This method is typically used within
    the BotPerformanceMonitor class to track and analyze the performance of database
    interactions, which can help identify bottlenecks or inefficient queries in bot
    behavior. The recorded data contributes to overall performance metrics that may
    be used for optimization or debugging purposes. This method does not return any
    value and simply stores the timing information internally.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The execution time of the database query, measured in microseconds.
      This value should be a positive integer representing the elapsed time from query
      start to completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint64 queryTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      monitor.RecordDatabaseQuery(queryTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Query Timing
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // Execute database query here

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordDatabaseQuery(duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a performance monitoring system designed for TrinityCore's
    bot framework. It assumes that the input value represents valid microseconds and
    does not perform validation on the parameter. The internal storage mechanism for
    these timings should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments.
