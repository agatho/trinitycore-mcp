  class: DistanceTrigger
  method: Check
  signature: bool DistanceTrigger::Check(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is within the defined distance trigger range to activate
    an action.
  description: The Check method evaluates whether the specified BotAI instance is
    currently within the distance threshold defined for this DistanceTrigger. It is
    typically used in AI behavior scripting to determine when certain actions or events
    should be triggered based on proximity to objects, players, or other game entities.
    The method returns true if the bot's current distance meets or exceeds the trigger
    condition, otherwise false. This functionality is essential for implementing proximity-based
    AI logic such as quest triggers, combat engagement, or NPC interaction detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the bot is within the defined
    distance trigger range. A return value of true means the bot meets the distance
    criteria to activate the associated behavior, while false indicates it does not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Trigger Check
    code: "if (distanceTrigger.Check(ai)) {\n    // Perform action when bot is within\
      \ range\n    ai->GetBot()->Say(\"I'm close enough!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached position data from the BotAI instance
    to avoid expensive distance calculations every frame. It may be called frequently
    during AI update cycles, so performance is important. The actual distance calculation
    logic depends on how the DistanceTrigger was initialized with its range parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer could cause a crash. Also, be aware
    that distance checks are typically based on 3D Euclidean distance, which may differ
    from in-game line-of-sight or ground distance depending on implementation.
