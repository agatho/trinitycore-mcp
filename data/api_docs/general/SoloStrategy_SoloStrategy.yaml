documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SoloStrategy class for handling single-player
    AI behavior.
  description: The SoloStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the SoloStrategy
    class, which is designed to manage artificial intelligence behaviors for solo
    player characters in World of Warcraft. This class typically handles decision-making
    processes, movement patterns, and combat strategies specific to single-player
    scenarios within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization process sets up
    internal state variables and prepares the strategy for use with player objects
    or AI-controlled entities.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a SoloStrategy Instance
    code: 'SoloStrategy* strategy = new SoloStrategy();

      // The strategy object is now initialized and ready for use

      // with player AI operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic structure of the SoloStrategy object.
    Developers should ensure that any required dependencies or context are properly
    configured before using the strategy in actual gameplay scenarios.
