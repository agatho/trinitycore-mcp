  class: AssistanceMovementGenerator
  method: AssistanceMovementGenerator
  signature: void AssistanceMovementGenerator::AssistanceMovementGenerator(int id,
    float x, float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an assistance movement generator with specified coordinates and
    ID for NPC movement behavior.
  description: The AssistanceMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement
    generator used by NPCs in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to handle assisted movement
    patterns. This method sets up internal state variables including the target position
    (x, y, z) and identifier (id) that define where the NPC should move when triggered.
    The generator is typically used in conjunction with AI systems to manage how units
    behave during combat or when assisting other units. It does not perform immediate
    movement but prepares the generator for subsequent execution by movement handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this assistance movement instance, used to
      distinguish between different movement generators in the same AI context
  - name: x
    description: Target X coordinate for the NPC's movement destination
  - name: y
    description: Target Y coordinate for the NPC's movement destination
  - name: z
    description: Target Z coordinate for the NPC's movement destination
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assistance Movement Initialization
    code: 'AssistanceMovementGenerator gen(1, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      // Initializes a movement generator with ID=1 targeting position (100, 200,
      300)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method that should be called during AI initialization
    or when setting up NPC behavior. The actual movement execution occurs later through
    the movement generator's Update() method and is integrated with the creature's
    movement system.
