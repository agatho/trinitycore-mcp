  signature: int LootEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current size of the loot event queue
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method returns the number of pending loot events
    currently queued for processing. This method provides a read-only snapshot of
    the internal queue size at the time of invocation, which is useful for monitoring
    system load and debugging loot-related issues. The returned value represents the
    count of items awaiting processing in the loot event system, not the actual loot
    items themselves. This method is typically used by administrators or developers
    to monitor server performance and ensure that loot events are being processed
    efficiently.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current number of loot events in the queue.
    A return value of zero indicates no pending loot events, while higher values suggest
    a backlog in processing. Negative values should not occur under normal circumstances
    and may indicate an internal error or race condition.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Loot Queue Size
    code: "int queueSize = lootEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queueSize > 100)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: Loot queue size is %d\"\
      , queueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the queue size. The
    returned value is a snapshot and may change immediately after the call. For performance-critical
    applications, consider caching this value rather than calling it repeatedly in
    tight loops.
  warnings: The queue size returned by this method does not guarantee that all events
    will be processed in order. Additionally, if multiple threads are accessing the
    loot system simultaneously, the queue size may fluctuate rapidly between calls
    to GetQueueSnapshot.
