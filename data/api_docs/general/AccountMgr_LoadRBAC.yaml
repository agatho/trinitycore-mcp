documentation:
  brief: Loads role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for all accounts from
    the database
  description: The LoadRBAC method initializes and loads the role-based access control
    system for the TrinityCore server. It retrieves all RBAC-related data from the
    database, including account permissions, roles, and privileges. This method is
    typically called during server startup or when RBAC data needs to be refreshed
    in memory. The loaded permissions are used to determine what actions each account
    can perform within the game world, such as accessing GM commands, modifying game
    objects, or managing accounts. This method ensures that all account access controls
    are properly initialized before the server begins processing player requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    AccountMgr::LoadRBAC();\n    // Continue with server startup...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries to load RBAC data and should only be
    called once during server initialization. The loaded RBAC data is cached in memory
    for performance reasons, so subsequent calls will not re-query the database unless
    explicitly required. This method may block execution while loading data from the
    database.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can cause duplicate
    entries or inconsistent permission states. It should only be invoked during server
    startup or when specifically reloading RBAC data. Improper handling of RBAC data
    can lead to security vulnerabilities in account access control.
