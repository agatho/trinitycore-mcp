  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SearchUnits
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SearchUnits(int & targetList, float radius, bool check3D)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for units within a specified radius of the area trigger and populates
    a target list.
  description: The SearchUnits method identifies all units (players, creatures, etc.)
    that are within a given radius of the area trigger's position. It performs a spatial
    search to locate nearby targets and adds them to the provided target list. The
    method supports both 2D and 3D distance checks depending on the check3D parameter.
    This functionality is commonly used in area trigger scripts to determine which
    units are affected by an area-based spell or effect.
  parameters:
  - name: targetList
    description: Reference to an integer list that will be populated with the GUIDs
      of units found within the specified radius.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance from the area trigger's position to consider
      for unit detection. Must be a positive value.
  - name: check3D
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to perform 3D distance checking (true)
      or 2D distance checking (false). 3D checks include vertical distance, while
      2D checks only consider horizontal distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Trigger Unit Search
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::OnUpdate(int diff)\n{\n    int targetList = 0;\n  \
      \  float radius = 10.0f;\n    bool check3D = false;\n    SearchUnits(targetList,\
      \ radius, check3D);\n    // Process the target list\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: 3D Area Trigger Unit Search with Vertical Range
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::OnUpdate(int diff)\n{\n    int targetList = 0;\n  \
      \  float radius = 15.0f;\n    bool check3D = true;\n    SearchUnits(targetList,\
      \ radius, check3D);\n    // Process the target list with vertical range consideration\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during area trigger update cycles. The targetList
    parameter should be initialized properly before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior. Performance may degrade with large numbers of units in the search radius.
  warnings: Ensure that the radius value is positive and reasonable for performance.
    Using a very large radius can cause performance issues. The targetList reference
    must point to a valid memory location; otherwise, undefined behavior will occur.
