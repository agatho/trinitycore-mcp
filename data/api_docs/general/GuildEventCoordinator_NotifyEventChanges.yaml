documentation:
  brief: Notifies all guild members of changes to a specific guild event
  description: The NotifyEventChanges method is responsible for broadcasting updates
    to a specified guild event to all connected guild members. This method ensures
    that players are informed of any modifications made to guild events such as scheduled
    meetings, raids, or social gatherings. The notification mechanism typically involves
    sending update packets through the game's network layer to maintain synchronization
    between the server and client instances. This method is commonly invoked when
    event details like time, location, or requirements are modified.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event that has been modified.
      This value must correspond to an existing guild event in the system's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Update Notification
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 updatedEventId = 12345;

      coordinator.NotifyEventChanges(updatedEventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Raid Event Details
    code: '// After modifying raid event details in database

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 raidEventId = sGuildEventManager->GetRaidEventId();

      coordinator.NotifyEventChanges(raidEventId);

      // All players will receive updated event information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a broadcast operation that may have performance
    implications for large guilds. The implementation probably uses caching mechanisms
    to avoid redundant notifications. It's important to ensure the eventId parameter
    is valid before calling this method to prevent potential errors or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId could result in server-side
    errors or failed network communications. Always validate that the event exists
    in the guild event system before invoking this notification method.
