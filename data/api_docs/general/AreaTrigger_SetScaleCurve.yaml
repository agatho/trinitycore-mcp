  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetScaleCurve(int scaleCurveMutator, const int & curve)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scale curve for an area trigger using a provided curve mutator and
    curve reference.
  description: The SetScaleCurve method configures the scaling behavior of an AreaTrigger
    by associating it with a specific scale curve. This is typically used in World
    of Warcraft triggers to define how the visual or interactive scale of the area
    trigger changes over time or based on game events. The method accepts a scale
    curve mutator which modifies the curve's application and a reference to an integer
    curve that defines the actual scaling values. This functionality allows for dynamic
    and animated area triggers, such as those used in spells, quests, or environmental
    effects. The curve parameter is expected to be a valid reference to a predefined
    curve data structure within the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleCurveMutator
    description: An integer value that modifies how the scale curve is applied to
      the area trigger. This mutator can control aspects such as animation speed,
      direction, or interpolation method for the scaling effect.
  - name: curve
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the curve data used
      for scaling. This parameter should point to a valid curve definition within
      the game's data structures that defines how the scale evolves over time or based
      on trigger conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SetScaleCurve
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      int myCurve[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0};

      trigger->SetScaleCurve(1, myCurve);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Scale Curve with Dynamic Mutator
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      int animationCurve[5] = {0, 10, 20, 10, 0};

      int mutator = 2; // Double speed

      trigger->SetScaleCurve(mutator, animationCurve);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTrigger's visual and interactive behavior
    system. It should be called during trigger initialization or when modifying an
    existing trigger's scaling properties. The curve data must be properly initialized
    and aligned with the expected format used by the game engine to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the curve reference may lead to crashes or visual
    glitches. Ensure that the referenced curve array is valid and has sufficient size
    for the intended animation sequence. Using invalid mutator values can cause unexpected
    scaling behaviors.
