documentation:
  brief: Returns the team identifier of the player, which determines faction alignment
    and gameplay mechanics.
  description: The GetTeamId method retrieves the unique team identifier associated
    with a player character. This value is crucial for determining faction relationships,
    PvP ranking, and various game mechanics that depend on team membership. The method
    returns an integer representing either the Alliance (1) or Horde (2) team, depending
    on the player's faction. It is commonly used in conjunction with other methods
    like GetFactionRank and GetPvpRank to determine a player's overall faction status
    and gameplay behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer value representing the team identifier: 1 for Alliance,
    2 for Horde. This value directly corresponds to the player''s faction and determines
    their team membership in World of Warcraft.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int teamId = player->GetTeamId();\nif (teamId == 1)\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ on Alliance team\n}\nelse if (teamId == 2)\n{\n    // Player is on Horde team\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    does not perform any complex calculations or require additional resources beyond
    simple memory access. The value returned is cached and does not change during
    gameplay unless the player's faction changes.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the team identifier, not the actual
    faction values. If you need to determine faction status, use GetFactionRank instead.
    Also note that this method may return 0 if the player has not yet been initialized
    or if they are in a state where their team is not yet determined.
