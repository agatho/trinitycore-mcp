  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: AdaptBotsToMeta
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::AdaptBotsToMeta()
documentation:
  brief: Adapts bot behavior based on meta-pattern recognition data.
  description: The AdaptBotsToMeta method adjusts the decision-making and action patterns
    of AI-controlled bots by analyzing and applying learned meta-patterns. This functionality
    is typically used in automated gameplay systems where bots need to dynamically
    modify their strategies based on observed player behaviors or environmental conditions.
    The method likely updates internal bot state machines or behavior trees with new
    pattern-based rules that improve bot performance and realism. It may be invoked
    during gameplay events, after learning phases, or when meta-patterns are updated
    from external sources.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    playerPatternRecognition.AdaptBotsToMeta();\n\
      \    // ... continue with bot updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves pattern recognition algorithms that analyze player
    behavior to inform bot adaptation. It may have performance implications if called
    frequently during active gameplay, as it could involve complex data processing
    or state updates across multiple bots.
  warnings: Ensure that meta-pattern data is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as incorrect or outdated patterns could lead to unpredictable bot behaviors.
    This method should not be called during critical sections of gameplay where bot
    stability is essential.
