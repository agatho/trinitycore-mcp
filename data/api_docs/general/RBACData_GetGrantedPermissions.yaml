  method: GetGrantedPermissions
  signature: const RBACPermissionContainer & RBACData::GetGrantedPermissions() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the container of granted permissions for this RBAC data instance.
  description: The GetGrantedPermissions method retrieves a constant reference to
    the RBACPermissionContainer that holds all permissions explicitly granted to the
    associated account or role within the TrinityCore authentication and authorization
    system. This container is used internally by the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
    subsystem to determine what actions a user or entity is allowed to perform. The
    returned container should not be modified directly, as it represents the current
    state of granted permissions. This method is typically called during permission
    checks or when building access control lists for various game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an RBACPermissionContainer object containing all
    currently granted permissions. The container can be empty if no permissions have
    been explicitly granted, but will never be null.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Granted Permissions
    code: "RBACData* rbacData = accountMgr->GetRBACData(accountId);\nconst RBACPermissionContainer&\
      \ grantedPerms = rbacData->GetGrantedPermissions();\nfor (auto it = grantedPerms.begin();\
      \ it != grantedPerms.end(); ++it)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Granted Permission\
      \ ID: \" << *it << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned container
    should not be modified. The RBACPermissionContainer internally manages permission
    IDs and may use optimized data structures for fast lookup during permission checks.
    This method is thread-safe as long as the underlying RBACData object is not being
    modified concurrently.
