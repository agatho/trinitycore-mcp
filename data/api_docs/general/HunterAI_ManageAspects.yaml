  method: ManageAspects
  signature: void HunterAI::ManageAspects()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the application and updating of hunter aspects based on current combat
    state and AI logic.
  description: The ManageAspects method is responsible for determining when and how
    to apply or update hunter aspects within the AI system. It evaluates the hunter's
    current combat situation, target status, and other relevant factors to decide
    whether an aspect should be active, refreshed, or replaced. This method ensures
    that the hunter maintains optimal aspect usage according to game mechanics and
    AI decision-making rules. The method typically integrates with the broader HunterAI
    framework to maintain proper aspect management during both melee and ranged combat
    scenarios.

  - title: Basic Aspect Management Call
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageAspects();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular AI update cycle. It
    may interact with internal state tracking variables to determine aspect applicability
    and should be invoked before other aspect-dependent actions. The implementation
    likely checks for existing aspects, their durations, and target conditions.
  warnings: Improper invocation timing or missing preconditions could lead to incorrect
    aspect application or conflicts with other AI behaviors. Ensure this method is
    called within the appropriate AI update context.
