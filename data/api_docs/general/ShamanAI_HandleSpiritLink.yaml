  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleSpiritLink()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the spirit link ability for a shaman AI, determining if the ability
    can be activated and executing its effects.
  description: The HandleSpiritLink method is responsible for managing the Spirit
    Link spell behavior within the ShamanAI class. This method evaluates whether the
    shaman's Spirit Link ability can be triggered, considering factors such as target
    validity, mana costs, and cooldown states. When successfully executed, it applies
    the spirit link effect to the targeted unit, typically providing healing or damage
    absorption. The method returns true if the ability was properly handled and false
    if it failed due to invalid conditions or constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Spirit Link ability was successfully processed and
    applied; otherwise returns false if the ability could not be executed due to invalid
    conditions, insufficient resources, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spirit Link Usage
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleSpiritLink()) {\n    // Spirit link was successfully\
      \ applied\n    // Perform additional logic if needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the shaman AI's update cycle or when
    a specific trigger condition is met. It relies on internal state tracking for
    mana, target selection, and cooldown management. The implementation may vary based
    on the specific shaman specialization (Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration).
  warnings: Ensure that the shaman AI has a valid target before calling this method,
    as attempting to apply Spirit Link without a proper target will likely result
    in failure. Also, be aware that this method does not directly handle spell casting
    animations or visual effects - those are managed separately by the core game engine.
