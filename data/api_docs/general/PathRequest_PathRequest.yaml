documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new path request object for navigation calculations in the
    game world.
  description: The PathRequest constructor initializes a new instance of the PathRequest
    class, setting up internal data structures required for pathfinding operations.
    This method prepares the object to handle navigation requests between two points
    in the TrinityCore world. The initialization typically includes allocating memory
    for path data, setting default values for request parameters, and preparing the
    object for use with the game's navigation system. This constructor is generally
    called internally by the pathfinding subsystem when a new navigation request needs
    to be processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PathRequest instance
    code: 'PathRequest request;

      // The request object is now initialized and ready for use

      // with pathfinding functions like PathRequest::CalculatePath()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by game developers. It's
    usually invoked automatically when creating new path requests through the navigation
    system API. The object should be properly initialized before any path calculation
    methods are called.
