documentation:
  brief: Sets the cosmetic mount display ID for a unit, allowing visual representation
    of a mount without affecting actual movement.
  description: This method assigns a cosmetic mount display ID to a Unit object, which
    controls how the mount appears visually in the game world. The display ID is used
    solely for visual purposes and does not impact the unit's actual movement or abilities.
    This method is typically used for cosmetic mounts that do not provide any gameplay
    benefits, such as decorative mounts or mounts that are purely visual. It is commonly
    employed when setting up player characters or NPCs to display specific mount visuals
    without affecting their physical capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: mountDisplayId
    description: The display ID of the cosmetic mount to be set. This value must correspond
      to a valid mount display ID in the game database, typically ranging from 0 to
      1000000. Values outside this range may cause visual issues or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetCosmeticMountDisplayId(12345);

      // This sets the cosmetic mount display to ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      uint32 mountId = 98765;

      unit->SetCosmeticMountDisplayId(mountId);

      // This sets the cosmetic mount display to ID 98765

      // The mount will appear visually but won''t affect actual movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects visual representation and does not influence gameplay
    mechanics such as movement speed or ability usage. It is important to note that
    the display ID must be valid and correspond to an existing mount in the game database
    to avoid visual glitches.
  warnings: Setting invalid display IDs may result in visual artifacts or errors.
    This method should not be used for mounts that provide gameplay benefits, as it
    only affects cosmetic appearance.
