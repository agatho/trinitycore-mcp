  method: SwitchToAggressiveStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::SwitchToAggressiveStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Switches the battleground AI to an aggressive strategy for the specified
    player.
  description: The SwitchToAggressiveStrategy method in BattlegroundAI is used to
    transition the AI behavior of a specific player to an aggressive combat stance.
    This typically involves changing the AI's decision-making process to prioritize
    offensive actions, such as pursuing enemies more aggressively or engaging in combat
    sooner. The method modifies internal AI state variables that control the strategic
    behavior during battleground encounters. It is commonly invoked when a player
    enters a combat zone or when certain game events trigger an aggressive response
    from the AI. This method does not directly affect the player's health or mana,
    but rather influences how the AI responds to environmental stimuli and enemy actions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier within the
      battleground context. This parameter specifies which player's AI state should
      be modified to use aggressive strategy.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = ...;

      int playerId = 42;

      bgAI->SwitchToAggressiveStrategy(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal AI state flags or behavior trees to
    adjust the strategic approach. It should only be called when the player is actively
    participating in a battleground and the AI system is initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing an invalid reference may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    is typically used internally by the battleground system and may not be safe to
    call directly from external code without proper context.
