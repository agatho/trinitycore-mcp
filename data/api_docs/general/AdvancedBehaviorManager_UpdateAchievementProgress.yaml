documentation:
  brief: Updates achievement progress for all active players in the manager's scope.
  description: The UpdateAchievementProgress method is responsible for processing
    and advancing achievement progress for players managed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
    This method typically gets called during the game loop to ensure that achievements
    are updated in real-time as players perform actions or meet criteria. It handles
    internal tracking of player progress, checks for completion conditions, and potentially
    triggers achievement rewards or notifications. The method operates on a per-tick
    basis using the diff parameter to determine time-based progression adjustments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateAchievementProgress(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    not be called directly by custom scripts unless specifically required. The diff
    parameter represents milliseconds since last update, which is used for time-based
    achievement progress calculations.
