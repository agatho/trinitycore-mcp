  class: AIDecisionTimer
  method: GetExecutionTime
  signature: uint64_t AIDecisionTimer::GetExecutionTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the execution time value stored in the AI decision timer instance.
  description: The GetExecutionTime method returns the internal timestamp or elapsed
    time value that was previously set within an AIDecisionTimer object. This value
    typically represents a point in time or duration used by AI systems to make decisions,
    such as when to perform actions or how long to wait before executing a new behavior.
    The returned uint64_t value is usually derived from the system's high-resolution
    timer and can be used for timing-based logic within AI decision-making processes.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the execution time stored in the timer instance.
    This value typically corresponds to a timestamp or elapsed milliseconds since
    some reference point, such as game start or AI initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetExecutionTime
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer;

      timer.SetExecutionTime(123456789ULL);

      uint64_t executionTime = timer.GetExecutionTime();

      // executionTime now holds 123456789ULL'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other timer-related methods
    like SetExecutionTime or ResetTimer. The returned value should be interpreted
    as a monotonic timestamp rather than a wall-clock time, ensuring consistent behavior
    across different system conditions.
