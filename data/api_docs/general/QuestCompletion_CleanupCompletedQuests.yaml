documentation:
  brief: Removes completed quest data from the player's quest log and associated tracking
    structures.
  description: The CleanupCompletedQuests method is responsible for purging all records
    of completed quests from a player's active quest log. This includes removing quest
    entries from internal tracking systems, clearing quest completion flags, and freeing
    up memory associated with quest state data. The method ensures that players cannot
    re-claim rewards or re-experience quest completion events after the initial completion.
    It typically runs during player logout, character deletion, or when quest data
    needs to be reset for gameplay balance purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    // Perform standard logout tasks\n    //\
      \ ...\n    \n    // Clean up completed quests before final logout\n    sQuestCompletion->CleanupCompletedQuests();\n\
      \    \n    // Continue with logout process\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player session cleanup routine.
    It may be invoked automatically by the core system or manually during specific
    game events like character deletion or server maintenance. The cleanup process
    does not affect quest objectives that are still in progress.
  warnings: Calling this method while a player is actively engaged in quest progression
    may lead to inconsistent quest state. Always ensure quests are properly saved
    before invoking cleanup operations.
