  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ManageGuildResponsibilities
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ManageGuildResponsibilities(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Manages guild responsibilities for a player, handling permissions and role
    assignments within the guild system.
  description: The ManageGuildResponsibilities method is responsible for overseeing
    and updating the guild-related duties and permissions assigned to a specific player.
    This method likely interacts with the internal guild management system to ensure
    that players have appropriate access levels, roles, and responsibilities based
    on their current standing within the guild. It may handle tasks such as assigning
    guild ranks, updating member permissions, or managing guild-specific privileges.
    The method operates on a player reference passed by pointer and is typically invoked
    during guild-related events or when changes occur in a player's guild membership
    status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system. This parameter specifies which player's guild
      responsibilities are to be managed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageGuildResponsibilities(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks to validate that the player exists
    in the guild and has a valid guild membership before proceeding with responsibility
    management. It may also trigger updates to the player's in-game UI or cache invalidation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null or invalid before calling this
    method, as it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes within the TrinityCore
    framework.
