  class: EvokerAI
  method: MaintainCastingRange
  signature: void EvokerAI::MaintainCastingRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains optimal casting range for the evoker AI by adjusting position relative
    to target.
  description: The MaintainCastingRange method is responsible for ensuring that an
    EvokerAI-controlled NPC maintains an appropriate distance from its target during
    spellcasting. This method likely evaluates the current distance between the evoker
    and its target, and if necessary, moves the evoker closer or farther away to keep
    within the effective casting range of its spells. It's a core part of the AI's
    behavior management system that helps optimize combat effectiveness by preventing
    the evoker from being too close or too far from enemies during critical spell
    casts. The method operates on the assumption that there is a valid target set
    in the AI's internal state, and it modifies the evoker's movement behavior to
    maintain optimal positioning.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index.
      This parameter likely points to the current target's unique identifier used
      by the AI system to track combat engagement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in evoker AI context
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        MaintainCastingRange(&targetId);\n\
      \        // Continue with spell casting logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the AI update cycle to ensure proper
    positioning before spell casting. It may interact with movement handlers and pathfinding
    systems within TrinityCore's AI framework. The exact implementation details depend
    on how the AI system tracks target positions and calculates optimal distances.
  warnings: The method assumes that a valid target exists and that the target parameter
    points to a legitimate identifier. Using an invalid or null pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes in the AI system.
