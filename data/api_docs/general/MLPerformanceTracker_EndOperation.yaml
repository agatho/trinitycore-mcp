  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: EndOperation
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::EndOperation(uint32_t botGuid, MLOperationType
    operation, bool success, uint32_t samplesProcessed)
documentation:
  brief: Marks the end of a machine learning operation for a specific bot, recording
    performance metrics and status.
  description: The EndOperation method is used to finalize a machine learning operation
    that was previously started for a bot. It records the completion status, number
    of samples processed, and other relevant performance data. This method is typically
    called after an ML operation has been executed to update tracking metrics and
    potentially trigger further actions based on success or failure. The method updates
    internal tracking structures within the MLPerformanceTracker class to maintain
    accurate performance statistics for each bot's operations.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier of the bot that performed the operation. This GUID
      is used to track and associate performance data with specific bots in the system.
  - name: operation
    description: Type of machine learning operation that was completed. This enum
      value indicates what kind of ML task was executed (e.g., training, inference,
      data processing).
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the operation completed successfully.
      True indicates successful completion, false indicates failure or error during
      execution.
  - name: samplesProcessed
    description: Number of data samples that were processed during the operation.
      This value is used to calculate performance metrics such as processing speed
      and efficiency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EndOperation
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      MLOperationType opType = MLOperationType::TRAINING;

      tracker.EndOperation(botGuid, opType, true, 1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: EndOperation with failure tracking
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 67890;

      MLOperationType opType = MLOperationType::INFERENCE;

      tracker.EndOperation(botGuid, opType, false, 500);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the bot's execution context
    and should not be invoked concurrently for the same bot GUID. The performance
    tracking data may be periodically flushed or logged depending on system configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that EndOperation is always paired with a corresponding StartOperation
    call for the same bot and operation type to maintain accurate tracking. Failure
    to do so may result in inconsistent performance metrics.
