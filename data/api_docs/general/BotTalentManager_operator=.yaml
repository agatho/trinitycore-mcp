    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns all talent data from another BotTalentManager instance to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for BotTalentManager copies all internal talent
    state, including learned talents, talent points, and associated data from the
    source BotTalentManager object. This method is typically used when updating or
    replacing the talent configuration of a bot character with that of another. The
    operation performs a deep copy of all relevant talent-related information, ensuring
    that the target instance reflects the exact same talent state as the source. This
    is particularly useful in scenarios where bot configurations need to be cloned
    or transferred between different instances.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotTalentManager object whose talent data will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotTalentManager instance (this), allowing for
    chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotTalentManager bot1;

      BotTalentManager bot2;

      // ... populate bot1 with talent data ...

      bot2 = bot1; // Assigns all talent data from bot1 to bot2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotTalentManager bot1, bot2, bot3;

      // ... populate bot1 with talent data ...

      bot3 = bot2 = bot1; // Chains assignment operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy of all internal talent data structures.
    The implementation should ensure thread safety if used in multi-threaded environments,
    though no explicit synchronization is typically required for this operation. Memory
    management is handled internally by the class.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large talent configurations as this may involve
    significant memory copying operations. Ensure that both source and target objects
    are properly initialized before assignment to avoid undefined behavior.
