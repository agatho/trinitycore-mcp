  class: GuardianThrashTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void GuardianThrashTracker::Update(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guardian's thrash tracking state based on target information.
  description: The GuardianThrashTracker::Update method manages the internal state
    of a guardian creature's thrash ability tracking. It processes the provided target
    pointer to determine if the guardian should initiate or continue a thrash attack,
    updating relevant timers, cooldowns, and combat states. This method is typically
    called during AI update cycles to maintain proper guardian behavior in response
    to target movements and combat conditions. The method modifies internal tracking
    variables but does not directly interact with the game world or send packets.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the current target object that the guardian is tracking
      for thrash ability usage. Must be a valid pointer to a Unit-derived object,
      or nullptr if no target exists.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    if (m_guardian)\n        m_guardian->GetThrashTracker()->Update(&m_target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Null Target Handling
    code: "void GuardianAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!m_target)\n       \
      \ m_thrashTracker->Update(nullptr);\n    else\n        m_thrashTracker->Update(&m_target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guardian AI system and should only be called from
    within the guardian's AI update loop. The target parameter must remain valid throughout
    the duration of this call, as the method may dereference it multiple times.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or dangling pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the target object remains alive and valid when
    passed to this method.
