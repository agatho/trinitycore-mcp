  signature: Item * Player::GetWeaponForAttack(int attackType, bool useable) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weapon item used for a specific attack type.
  description: The GetWeaponForAttack method retrieves the weapon item that is currently
    equipped and ready for use in the specified attack type. This method is commonly
    used during combat to determine which weapon should be used for melee attacks,
    ranged attacks, or spellcasting. It considers the player's equipped items, weapon
    slots, and attack type to return the appropriate weapon. The method accounts for
    different attack types such as main hand, off hand, and ranged attacks, and can
    optionally check if the weapon is usable based on requirements like ammo availability
    or weapon type.
  parameters:
  - name: attackType
    description: Specifies the type of attack to retrieve the weapon for. Valid values
      include ATTACK_TYPE_MAINHAND, ATTACK_TYPE_OFFHAND, and ATTACK_TYPE_RANGED. This
      parameter determines which weapon slot to check.
  - name: useable
    description: When set to true, the method will verify that the weapon is usable
      (e.g., has sufficient ammo for ranged attacks or is not a two-handed weapon
      when only one hand is available). When false, it returns the weapon regardless
      of usability.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an Item object representing the weapon currently equipped
    for the specified attack type. If no weapon is found or if the weapon is not usable
    (when useable=true), the method returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* weapon = player->GetWeaponForAttack(ATTACK_TYPE_MAINHAND, true);\n\
      if (weapon != nullptr)\n{\n    // Weapon is available and usable\n    // Do\
      \ something with the weapon\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Item* weapon = player->GetWeaponForAttack(ATTACK_TYPE_RANGED, false);\n\
      if (weapon != nullptr)\n{\n    // Weapon is available even if not usable\n \
      \   // Do something with the weapon\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No weapon found for\
      \ ranged attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during combat calculations and does not directly
    modify the player's inventory. It relies on the player's equipped items and may
    return nullptr if no weapon is available or if the weapon is not usable based
    on the useable parameter.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if the player has no weapon equipped for
    the specified attack type, especially when useable=true and the weapon requires
    additional conditions such as ammo or proper hand usage. Be cautious when using
    this method in combat situations where weapon availability is critical.
