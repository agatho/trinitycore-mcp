  class: InterruptManager
  method: AssessCrowdControlPriority
  signature: InterruptPriority InterruptManager::AssessCrowdControlPriority(const
    SpellInfo * spellInfo, Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level of a spell's crowd control effect
    based on its properties and caster.
  description: The AssessCrowdControlPriority method determines the relative importance
    or potency of a spell's crowd control capabilities by analyzing the spell's data
    and the unit that cast it. This is used internally by the TrinityCore AI system
    to prioritize which spells should be interrupted or countered during combat. The
    method considers factors such as the spell's duration, mechanics, and the caster's
    status when assigning a priority level. It plays a crucial role in determining
    interrupt behavior for units under the influence of crowd control effects.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that cast the spell. This parameter is used to
      determine caster-specific properties that may affect priority assessment.
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority enum value indicating how high-priority the
    spell's crowd control effect is. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or
    VERY_HIGH depending on the spell's characteristics and the caster's influence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager.AssessCrowdControlPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nif (priority >= InterruptPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Prioritize interrupting\
      \ this spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority for Spell Selection
    code: "InterruptPriority currentPriority = interruptManager.AssessCrowdControlPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nif (currentPriority > highestPriority) {\n    highestPriority =\
      \ currentPriority;\n    bestSpell = spellInfo;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI decision-making processes when
    evaluating potential interrupt targets. It's important to note that the actual
    priority values may vary based on internal TrinityCore configurations and spell
    definitions. The method assumes valid inputs and does not perform null checks.
  warnings: Ensure that both spellInfo and caster parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null values could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method should only be called in contexts where the spell and caster
    are known to be active and valid.
