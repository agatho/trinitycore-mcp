documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the stable pet info object, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a StablePetInfo object. This operation is typically used to indicate that
    any previous modifications to the pet's data have been acknowledged or committed,
    effectively clearing the 'dirty' flags that track which fields have been altered
    since the last synchronization. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method helps manage the state of stable pets by ensuring that changes are
    properly tracked and synchronized with the client. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple state-resetting
    utility.

    code: 'StablePetInfo petInfo;

      petInfo.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after sending updates to the client or when
    committing changes to persistent storage. It's important to understand that clearing
    the mask does not alter the actual pet data, only the tracking of which fields
    have been modified.
