  class: GroupIntegration
  method: UpdateGroupCoordination
  signature: void GroupIntegration::UpdateGroupCoordination(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination data for all members in the specified group.
  description: The UpdateGroupCoordination method synchronizes group-related coordination
    information across all members of a given group. This typically involves updating
    player positions, roles, and other shared group state data to ensure all members
    have consistent information. The method is commonly used during group formation,
    member changes, or when significant group events occur that require synchronization
    of group-wide data. It ensures that all players in the group are aware of each
    other's current status and positioning within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination data needs to be updated.
      Must not be null. The group must be valid and contain at least one member for
      the method to have any effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Coordination Update
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   GroupIntegration::UpdateGroupCoordination(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Coordination After Member Join
    code: "Player* newMember = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(newMemberGuid);\nif (newMember\
      \ && newMember->GetGroup())\n{\n    GroupIntegration::UpdateGroupCoordination(newMember->GetGroup());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal synchronization mechanisms that update
    client-side group information. It should be called whenever there are changes
    to group composition or important group state that needs to be propagated to all
    members.
  warnings: Ensure the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method may cause network
    traffic and performance overhead if called frequently with large groups.
