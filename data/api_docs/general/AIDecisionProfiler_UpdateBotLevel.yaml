  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: UpdateBotLevel
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::UpdateBotLevel(uint32_t botGuid, uint8_t newLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI decision profiler with the new level of a bot identified by
    its GUID.
  description: The UpdateBotLevel method is used to update the internal tracking of
    a bot's level within the AIDecisionProfiler system. This method allows the profiler
    to maintain accurate data about bot behavior and decision-making patterns as the
    bot levels up during gameplay. The function takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID)
    and its new level, then updates any relevant internal structures or logs that
    track AI performance metrics based on bot level. This is essential for maintaining
    accurate profiling data when bots gain experience and level up in World of Warcraft
    environments.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose level is being updated.
      This value uniquely identifies a specific bot instance within the TrinityCore
      system.
  - name: newLevel
    description: The new level value that the bot has reached. This should be a valid
      player level value, typically ranging from 1 to the maximum level supported
      by the game (e.g., 80 for retail WoW).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      uint32_t botGuid = 123456;

      uint8_t newLevel = 15;

      profiler.UpdateBotLevel(botGuid, newLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Level-Up Logic
    code: "void OnBotLevelUp(uint32_t guid, uint8_t level)\n{\n    // Update profiler\
      \ when bot levels up\n    AIDecisionProfiler::Instance()->UpdateBotLevel(guid,\
      \ level);\n    // Additional logic for handling level-up events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI profiling system designed to monitor
    and analyze bot decision-making patterns across different levels. The implementation
    may involve updating internal data structures or logging systems that track performance
    metrics by bot level.
