  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::HandleRuneAndPowerManagement(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages rune and power resources for a Death Knight AI, determining if sufficient
    resources are available to perform an action.
  description: The HandleRuneAndPowerManagement method is responsible for managing
    the resource allocation of a Death Knight's runes and power (runic power) during
    AI decision-making. It evaluates whether the Death Knight has enough available
    runes and sufficient runic power to execute a specific ability or attack, such
    as Blood Strike or Frost Strike. This method typically checks the current state
    of the Death Knight's rune cooldowns and power levels, and may return false if
    resources are insufficient to proceed with an action. The method is part of the
    core AI logic that ensures proper resource management and prevents invalid spell
    casting. It plays a critical role in maintaining balanced gameplay mechanics for
    Death Knights in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if sufficient runes and power are available to perform an
    action, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    AI should defer or select an alternative ability due to resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Death Knight AI logic
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->HandleRuneAndPowerManagement(target)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with casting a spell that requires runes and power\n    deathKnightAI->CastSpell(SPELL_BLOOD_STRIKE);\n\
      } else {\n    // Choose an alternative ability or wait\n    deathKnightAI->SelectNextAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to cast any Death Knight
    spell that consumes runes or runic power. It's important for the AI to properly
    handle the return value to avoid invalid actions. The implementation likely involves
    checking internal rune states and power levels, which may be updated by other
    methods in the AI class.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper target validation, as
    it might lead to incorrect resource management decisions. Also, calling this method
    too frequently without considering cooldowns or other game state changes could
    result in suboptimal AI behavior.
