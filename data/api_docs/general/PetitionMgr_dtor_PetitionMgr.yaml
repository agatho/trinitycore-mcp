documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PetitionMgr instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PetitionMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of the petition management
    system. This includes cleaning up any active petition data structures, removing
    references to petition templates, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory
    leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when a PetitionMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it
    an essential part of proper resource management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PetitionMgr
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    PetitionMgr* mgr = new PetitionMgr();\n    // ...\
      \ use mgr ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to ensure that all petition-related operations are completed
    before the manager is destroyed, as pending operations may lead to undefined behavior.
