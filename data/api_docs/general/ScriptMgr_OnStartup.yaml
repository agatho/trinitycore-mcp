  method: OnStartup
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnStartup()
documentation:
  brief: Executes startup routines for all registered scripts in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The OnStartup method is invoked during the server's initialization
    phase to allow script modules to perform necessary setup operations. This method
    ensures that all registered scripts have an opportunity to initialize their internal
    state, register callbacks, or perform any one-time configuration required before
    the server begins normal operation. It serves as a central point for script initialization
    and is typically called once during server startup, after core systems are initialized
    but before the game world is fully active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom script module
    code: "#include \"ScriptMgr.h\"\n\nclass MyCustomScript : public ScriptObject\n\
      {\npublic:\n    MyCustomScript() : ScriptObject(\"MyCustomScript\") {}\n\n \
      \   void OnStartup() override\n    {\n        // Initialize custom data structures\n\
      \        // Register events or callbacks\n        // Perform one-time setup\
      \ tasks\n        sLog->outString(\"MyCustomScript initialized successfully\"\
      );\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called synchronously during server startup and should not
    perform long-running operations that could delay server initialization. Scripts
    should avoid heavy computations or blocking calls in this method to maintain server
    responsiveness.
  warnings: Avoid performing database operations or accessing world state within OnStartup
    as the server may not be fully initialized. This method is intended for lightweight
    initialization tasks only.
