  class: LFGPlayerScript
  method: LFGPlayerScript
  signature: void LFGPlayerScript::LFGPlayerScript()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LFGPlayerScript class for handling player-specific
    LFG (Looking for Group) functionality.
  description: The LFGPlayerScript constructor initializes the necessary internal
    state and data structures required for managing player participation in Looking
    for Group activities within TrinityCore. This includes setting up event handlers,
    initializing player-specific LFG queues, and preparing the script to respond to
    LFG-related game events such as joining or leaving groups, queue updates, and
    dungeon completion. The constructor ensures that all required subsystems are properly
    configured before the script begins processing LFG operations for a given player.

  examples:
  - title: Creating an LFGPlayerScript instance
    code: 'LFGPlayerScript* lfgScript = new LFGPlayerScript();

      // The script is now ready to handle LFG events for a player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a player object is created or when LFG functionality is enabled for a specific
    player. Developers should not directly instantiate this class unless implementing
    custom LFG behavior extensions.
