documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a world map.
  description: The IsWorldMap method checks if the current MapEntry instance corresponds
    to a world map, which typically includes outdoor zones and major continents. This
    is useful for distinguishing between world maps and instance maps such as dungeons
    or raids. The method returns true if the map is a world map, false otherwise.
    It's commonly used in game logic to determine how to handle map-related operations,
    such as player movement, quest tracking, or UI display.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a world map; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry is a World Map
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(0); // Example: Map ID 0\nif (entry->IsWorldMap())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"This map is a world map.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"This\
      \ map is not a world map.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags or properties of the MapEntry structure
    that indicate whether it's a world map. It does not perform any external lookups
    or computations, so it should be fast to execute.
