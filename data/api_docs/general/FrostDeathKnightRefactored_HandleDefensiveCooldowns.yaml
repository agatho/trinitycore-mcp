documentation:
  brief: Handles the application and management of defensive cooldowns for the frost
    death knight AI.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing all
    defensive cooldown abilities that a frost death knight AI should utilize during
    combat. This includes checking if defensive abilities such as Death Strike, Icebound
    Fortitude, or Anti-Magic Shell are available and applying them based on the current
    health state and threat level of the player. The method evaluates the AI's current
    situation to determine when to activate these cooldowns for optimal survivability.
    It ensures that defensive abilities are not used unnecessarily and are timed appropriately
    to maximize their effectiveness in high-threat situations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper cooldown management. It assumes that the AI has access to the player's
    current health and threat level information. The implementation may vary based
    on the specific frost death knight build or specialization being simulated.
  warnings: Improper handling of defensive cooldowns can lead to unnecessary resource
    consumption or reduced survivability in combat situations. Ensure that this method
    is not called too frequently as it may interfere with other AI behaviors.
