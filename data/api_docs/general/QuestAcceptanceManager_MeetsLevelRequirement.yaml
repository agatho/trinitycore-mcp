documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the level requirement for a given quest
  description: The MeetsLevelRequirement method evaluates whether the player character
    has sufficient level to accept a specified quest. This method typically compares
    the player's current level against the minimum level required by the quest. It
    is commonly used during quest acceptance logic to prevent players from taking
    quests that are too difficult for their current progression. The method returns
    true if the player's level meets or exceeds the quest's minimum requirement, and
    false otherwise. This check is essential for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    players progress through content in an appropriate order.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest identifier or data structure
      containing quest information. The quest parameter typically points to a quest
      entry in the database that contains level requirements.
  returns: Returns true if the player's character level meets or exceeds the minimum
    level requirement for the specified quest, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Level Check
    code: "if (questManager.MeetsLevelRequirement(&questId)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot accept the quest due to level requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not high enough level to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance Logic
    code: "bool QuestAcceptanceManager::CanAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId)\
      \ {\n    if (!player || questId == 0) return false;\n    \n    const int* questPtr\
      \ = &questId;\n    if (MeetsLevelRequirement(questPtr)) {\n        // Additional\
      \ checks can be performed here\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal player data structures and quest database
    entries. It may involve database lookups or cached quest information depending
    on the implementation. The method is probably called frequently during quest interaction,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account for large-scale implementations.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest parameter points to valid quest data; passing an
    invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method may not account
    for other quest requirements such as reputation, item prerequisites, or previous
    quest completion status.
