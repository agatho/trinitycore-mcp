  signature: void LootEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the provided processing time for loot event
    handling.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related statistics within the LootEventBus class. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the time taken to process a loot event, which is then used
    to maintain aggregate metrics such as average processing time, total events processed,
    and other performance indicators. This method is typically called after a loot
    event has been fully handled to ensure accurate tracking of system performance.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input parameter, so callers
    should ensure that the processingTime value represents a valid duration.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time taken (in microseconds) to process a loot event. This value
      is used to update internal performance metrics and should represent a valid
      non-negative duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootEventBus bus;

      std::chrono::microseconds time(1500);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(time);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... loot event processing code ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      LootEventBus::Instance()->UpdateMetrics(duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the loot event processing pipeline
    to track performance. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    affect gameplay mechanics but rather provides diagnostic information for system
    monitoring and optimization purposes.
