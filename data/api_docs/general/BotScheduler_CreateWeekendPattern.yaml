  class: BotScheduler
  method: CreateWeekendPattern
  signature: ActivityPattern BotScheduler::CreateWeekendPattern() const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns an activity pattern specifically designed for weekend
    scheduling.
  description: The CreateWeekendPattern method generates a predefined ActivityPattern
    object tailored for weekend activities within the TrinityCore bot system. This
    pattern typically defines specific behaviors or schedules that are appropriate
    for weekends, such as increased idle time, different quest priorities, or special
    event participation. The method is part of the BotScheduler class which manages
    scheduling and activity patterns for AI-controlled bots in World of Warcraft.
    It does not require any parameters and returns a fully initialized ActivityPattern
    object ready for use in scheduling logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActivityPattern object representing the weekend-specific schedule configuration,
    including time ranges, activity priorities, and behavioral settings appropriate
    for weekend gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ActivityPattern weekendPattern = scheduler.CreateWeekendPattern();

      // Use the pattern to configure bot behavior for weekends

      bot.SetActivityPattern(weekendPattern);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other scheduling methods to
    create comprehensive weekly activity schedules. The returned ActivityPattern should
    be treated as immutable after creation, and modifications should be made through
    dedicated setter methods if available.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned pattern is properly applied to bots before weekend
    events begin, as incorrect scheduling may lead to unexpected bot behavior during
    weekend activities.
