  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: HasTankSpec
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::HasTankSpec() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current behavior manager is configured for a tank
    specialization.
  description: The HasTankSpec method checks if the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance
    is currently set up to handle tank-specific behaviors. This typically involves
    verifying that the associated player or unit has a tank role assigned, which may
    influence AI decision-making, threat management, and ability prioritization within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method returns true when the manager is configured
    for tank duties, and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in group-based
    AI systems where different roles require distinct behavioral patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the AdaptiveBehaviorManager is configured
    for tank specialization. Returns true if tank-specific behaviors are active; returns
    false if not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.HasTankSpec()) {\n    // Perform tank-specific actions\n\
      \    unit->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n} else {\n    // Handle non-tank\
      \ behavior\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the associated unit's
    role or specialization. It may be called frequently during AI update cycles, so
    performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
