  method: SetXP
  signature: void Player::SetXP(uint32 xp)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the experience points for the player to the specified value.
  description: The SetXP method allows developers to directly assign a specific amount
    of experience points to a player character. This method is commonly used in custom
    scripts or game master tools to adjust player levels, modify experience values,
    or bypass normal experience progression mechanics. It directly updates the player's
    current experience value without any validation checks, making it suitable for
    administrative purposes but potentially dangerous if misused.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of experience points to set for the player. This value
      should be a positive integer representing the total experience points desired.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Experience Points
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetXP(10000);

      // Sets the player''s experience to 10,000 points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's experience without any checks
    or validations. It bypasses normal game progression logic and should be used carefully
    in scripts or game master tools. The method is typically used in conjunction with
    other methods like SetLevel or SetMaxXP to fully control player experience and
    level.
  warnings: Using this method can cause immediate level changes if the experience
    value exceeds what is normally required for a level-up, potentially causing unexpected
    behavior. It should not be used in normal gameplay scenarios as it bypasses game
    mechanics that normally govern experience progression.
