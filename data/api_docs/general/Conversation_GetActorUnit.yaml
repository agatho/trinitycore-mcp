  class: Conversation
  method: GetActorUnit
  signature: Unit * Conversation::GetActorUnit(int actorIdx) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Unit associated with a specific actor index in a conversation.
  description: The GetActorUnit method retrieves the Unit object corresponding to
    a given actor index within a conversation. This method is typically used when
    iterating through or accessing specific actors involved in a dialogue sequence.
    The actor index usually maps to a particular NPC or player character participating
    in the conversation. The returned Unit pointer can be used to access various properties
    and behaviors of the actor, such as their position, health, or faction. This method
    assumes that the conversation has been properly initialized and that the specified
    actor index is valid within the context of the current conversation.
  parameters:
  - name: actorIdx
    description: The zero-based index of the actor in the conversation. Valid values
      are typically between 0 and the total number of actors minus one. This index
      corresponds to the order in which actors were added to the conversation.
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the actor at the specified index.
    Returns nullptr if the actor index is invalid or out of bounds, or if no unit
    is associated with that actor slot.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing an Actor Unit in a Conversation
    code: "Conversation* conv = ...; // Assume conversation is initialized\nUnit*\
      \ actor = conv->GetActorUnit(0);\nif (actor)\n{\n    // Use the actor unit,\
      \ e.g., get their name or position\n    sLog->outString(\"Actor 0 is: %s\",\
      \ actor->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through All Actors in a Conversation
    code: "Conversation* conv = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < conv->GetActorCount(); ++i)\n\
      {\n    Unit* actor = conv->GetActorUnit(i);\n    if (actor)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Process each actor\n        sLog->outString(\"Processing actor %d: %s\"\
      , i, actor->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of World of Warcraft's conversation
    system where NPCs and players interact through dialogue trees. The method does
    not perform bounds checking internally, so it is up to the caller to ensure that
    actorIdx is valid. If the conversation has not been initialized or if actors have
    not been properly set up, this method may return nullptr.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid indices as it may lead
    to null pointer dereferences. Always validate the returned Unit pointer before
    using it. Also note that the actor index might change if the conversation structure
    is modified dynamically during runtime.
