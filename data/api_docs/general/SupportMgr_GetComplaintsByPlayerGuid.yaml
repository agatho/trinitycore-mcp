documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all complaint tickets associated with a specific player GUID.
  description: The GetComplaintsByPlayerGuid method fetches a list of complaint tickets
    submitted by a particular player identified by their global unique identifier
    (GUID). This function is typically used in the support management system to allow
    staff members to view all complaints filed by a specific user. The returned list
    contains all active and resolved tickets for that player, which can be useful
    for tracking player behavior, identifying recurring issues, or resolving disputes.
    The method does not modify any data but provides read-only access to complaint
    records stored in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose complaints are to
      be retrieved. This value corresponds to the player's account or character GUID
      used internally by TrinityCore.
  returns: A ComplaintTicketList containing all complaint tickets associated with
    the specified player GUID. The list may be empty if no complaints exist for the
    given player.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Process Player Complaints
    code: "ComplaintTicketList tickets = sSupportMgr->GetComplaintsByPlayerGuid(12345);\n\
      for (auto& ticket : tickets)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Ticket ID: \" << ticket.GetId()\
      \ << \", Status: \" << ticket.GetStatus() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query to fetch complaint records, so performance
    may be impacted when retrieving complaints for players with many tickets. The
    returned list is a copy and modifications to it will not affect the original data
    in the system.
