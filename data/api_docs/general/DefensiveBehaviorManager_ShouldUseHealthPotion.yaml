  signature: bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseHealthPotion() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player should use a health potion based on current
    health and combat state.
  description: The ShouldUseHealthPotion method evaluates the player's current health
    percentage, available mana, and combat status to decide if using a health potion
    would be beneficial. This method is typically used by AI behavior systems to make
    intelligent decisions about resource usage during encounters. The decision considers
    factors such as whether the player is in combat, their current health level, and
    if they have sufficient mana to cast any necessary spells. It does not directly
    consume or apply the potion but rather returns a boolean value indicating whether
    the action should be taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's health is below a certain threshold and using
    a health potion would improve their survival chances in combat; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (defensiveManager.ShouldUseHealthPotion()) {\n    // Trigger health\
      \ potion usage logic\n    player.UseItem(HEALTH_POTION_ITEM_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Check
    code: "if (player.IsInCombat() && defensiveManager.ShouldUseHealthPotion()) {\n\
      \    // Only use potion when in combat and health is low\n    player.CastSpell(HEALTH_POTION_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates configurable thresholds for health percentage
    and mana levels, which may be adjusted based on difficulty settings or class-specific
    behaviors. The implementation probably includes checks for potion availability
    and cooldowns to prevent spamming potion usage.
  warnings: Do not assume this method will always return true when health is low;
    it considers multiple factors including combat state and resource management.
    Using potions recklessly without considering mana costs or spell priorities may
    lead to suboptimal gameplay decisions.
