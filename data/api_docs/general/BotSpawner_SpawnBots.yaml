documentation:
  brief: Spawns a specified number of bot characters into the game world
  description: The SpawnBots method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    given number of bot characters within the World of Warcraft environment. This
    method typically handles the allocation of necessary resources, assignment of
    unique identifiers, and integration of bots into the existing game world state.
    It may also manage bot behavior initialization, faction assignment, and other
    relevant setup tasks required for proper bot operation. The method operates within
    the TrinityCore framework's bot system architecture and is commonly invoked during
    server startup, bot management commands, or automated testing scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: The number of bot characters to spawn. This parameter specifies how
      many new bot instances should be created and added to the game world. Valid
      values are typically positive integers representing the desired count of bots
      to generate.
  returns: Returns the actual number of bot characters successfully spawned. The return
    value may be less than the requested amount if resource limitations or other constraints
    prevent spawning all requested bots. A return value of zero indicates no bots
    were successfully created.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: 'uint32 spawnedCount = botSpawner.SpawnBots(5);

      // Spawns 5 bot characters and returns the actual count spawned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Bot Count Spawning
    code: "int requestCount = 10;\nuint32 actualSpawned = botSpawner.SpawnBots(requestCount);\n\
      if (actualSpawned < requestCount)\n{\n    // Handle partial spawning scenario\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Only %u of %d requested bots were spawned\", actualSpawned,\
      \ requestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs thread-safe operations within the TrinityCore
    framework. It may interact with internal bot management systems and could have
    performance implications when spawning large numbers of bots simultaneously. The
    actual implementation might involve memory allocation for bot objects, database
    interactions for character creation, and world state updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with very large values for 'requests' parameter may
    cause performance degradation or resource exhaustion. Ensure proper error handling
    as partial spawning can occur due to system limitations. This method should not
    be called from within critical sections where race conditions might occur.
