  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CastEyeBeam
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastEyeBeam(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Eye Beam ability on the specified target.
  description: The CastEyeBeam method executes the Demon Hunter's Eye Beam spell,
    which is a powerful ranged attack that deals damage to enemies in a cone in front
    of the caster. This ability typically has a cooldown and may require specific
    resource costs such as Fury or Discipline. The method takes a pointer to an integer
    representing the target's identifier and performs the necessary checks before
    casting the spell. It integrates with the Demon Hunter's AI logic to ensure proper
    targeting and execution within combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the target unit to cast Eye Beam upon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastEyeBeam
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastEyeBeam(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Demon Hunter is in combat and
    has sufficient resources to cast Eye Beam. The target must be within the spell's
    range and line of sight. Implementation assumes that the AI has already validated
    the target and determined it is a valid enemy unit.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before passing it to this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, verify that the Demon
    Hunter's current state allows for spell casting (e.g., not stunned or silenced).
