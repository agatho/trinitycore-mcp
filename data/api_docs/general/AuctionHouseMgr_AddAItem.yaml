  signature: void AuctionHouseMgr::AddAItem(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to the auction house system for listing.
  description: The AddAItem method is responsible for inserting a given Item object
    into the auction house database and making it available for bidding. This method
    typically handles the necessary bookkeeping such as setting up auction records,
    calculating auction fees, and updating item ownership status. It integrates with
    the broader auction house management system to ensure proper tracking of items
    and their auction lifecycle. The method assumes that the provided Item object
    is valid and properly initialized before being passed in.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that should be added to the auction house.
      This item must be valid and fully initialized with proper data including item
      template, owner information, and any applicable enchantments or modifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (myItem)\n{\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->AddAItem(myItem);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Item* auctionItem = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, slot);\n\
      if (auctionItem && auctionItem->GetTemplate()->AllowableClass & player->getClassMask())\n\
      {\n    // Ensure item is not soulbound or otherwise restricted\n    if (!auctionItem->IsSoulBound()\
      \ && !auctionItem->IsBindingNotPlayer())\n    {\n        sAuctionHouseMgr->AddAItem(auctionItem);\n\
      \        player->SendAuctionSellItemResult(AUCTION_SUCCESS);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the process of listing an item for
    auction. It may trigger database writes and should be used carefully in performance-sensitive
    contexts. The method does not validate if the item is already listed or owned
    by another player; it assumes that such checks are performed prior to calling
    this function.
  warnings: Calling AddAItem with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, passing an item that has already been auctioned or is bound to another
    player may cause inconsistencies in the auction house system. Always ensure proper
    validation and state management before invoking this method.
