    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal arena strategy to counter a given enemy
    team composition.
  description: The GetCounterStrategy method analyzes the provided enemy team composition
    and selects the most effective arena strategy to counter it. This method is typically
    used by AI-controlled players or bots in battlegrounds to dynamically adjust their
    gameplay approach based on the opposing team's makeup. The returned ArenaStrategy
    object contains information about the recommended tactics, class selections, and
    overall approach for maximum effectiveness against the specified enemy composition.
  parameters:
  - name: enemyComp
    description: The TeamComposition object representing the current enemy team's
      class distribution and roles. This parameter defines the makeup of the opposing
      team that the AI needs to counter.
  returns: An ArenaStrategy object that contains the recommended strategy for countering
    the provided enemy composition. The returned strategy includes details such as
    preferred class selections, tactical approaches, and gameplay adjustments tailored
    specifically to exploit weaknesses in the enemy team's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get counter strategy
    code: 'TeamComposition enemyTeam;

      // ... populate enemyTeam with enemy composition data

      ArenaStrategy counter = arenaAI.GetCounterStrategy(enemyTeam);

      // Use counter strategy for AI decision making'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using counter strategy in arena combat logic
    code: "void ArenaCombat::Update()\n{\n    TeamComposition enemyComp = GetEnemyTeamComposition();\n\
      \    ArenaStrategy strategy = arenaAI.GetCounterStrategy(enemyComp);\n    \n\
      \    // Apply the counter strategy\n    switch (strategy.GetType())\n    {\n\
      \        case ARENA_STRATEGY_MELEE:\n            SelectMeleeClasses();\n   \
      \         break;\n        case ARENA_STRATEGY_RANGED:\n            SelectRangedClasses();\n\
      \            break;\n        case ARENA_STRATEGY_BALANCED:\n            SelectBalancedComposition();\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during arena matchmaking or combat initialization
    phases. The strategy returned may vary based on internal AI logic, current game
    state, and available class restrictions. The method assumes that enemyComp contains
    valid team composition data and does not perform validation checks on the input
    parameter.
  warnings: The method returns a strategy object that should be used immediately as
    its effectiveness may change with dynamic battlefield conditions. Do not cache
    or reuse returned ArenaStrategy objects across different combat scenarios without
    re-evaluation.
