  signature: int MovementArbiter::GetCurrentRequest() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the identifier of the currently active movement request managed
    by the MovementArbiter.
  description: The GetCurrentRequest method returns an integer identifier representing
    the currently processed or pending movement request within the MovementArbiter.
    This identifier is typically used to track and manage ongoing movement operations
    for units such as players or creatures in the game world. The method provides
    access to the active request without modifying its state, making it useful for
    monitoring or debugging movement behavior. It is commonly called during movement
    update cycles or when checking the status of a unit's current motion command.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer identifier representing the currently active movement request.
    A value of -1 typically indicates no active request, while positive integers correspond
    to specific request IDs assigned by the arbiter.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Movement Request
    code: "int currentRequest = arbiter.GetCurrentRequest();\nif (currentRequest !=\
      \ -1)\n{\n    // Process or log the active movement request\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Active movement request ID: %d\", currentRequest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the
    MovementArbiter. It should be used primarily in contexts where movement status
    needs to be queried without altering execution flow.
