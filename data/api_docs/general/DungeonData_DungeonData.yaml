  class: DungeonData
  method: DungeonData
  signature: void DungeonData::DungeonData(uint32 id, const std::string & name, uint32
    map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new dungeon data entry with the specified ID, name, and map
    identifier.
  description: The DungeonData constructor initializes a dungeon data entry with the
    provided unique identifier, name, and associated map ID. This method is typically
    used to set up dungeon configurations within the TrinityCore framework for World
    of Warcraft content. The initialization process ensures that all necessary dungeon
    metadata is properly configured for use in game systems such as instance management,
    player grouping, and quest handling. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters, so it's expected that valid values are passed to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon entry. This value should be a positive
      integer that uniquely identifies this dungeon within the game world.
  - name: name
    description: String name of the dungeon. This represents the display name used
      in UI elements and logs related to the dungeon.
  - name: map
    description: Map identifier associated with this dungeon. This corresponds to
      the map ID that defines where the dungeon is located within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Data Initialization
    code: DungeonData instance(1234, "The Burning Crusade", 530);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a New Dungeon Entry
    code: 'DungeonData shadowfangKeep(33, "Shadowfang Keep", 33);

      // Initializes a new dungeon entry for Shadowfang Keep with ID 33 on map 33'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger class structure and may be used internally
    by TrinityCore's instance management system. Developers should ensure that the
    provided parameters are valid and consistent with existing dungeon definitions
    to prevent runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
