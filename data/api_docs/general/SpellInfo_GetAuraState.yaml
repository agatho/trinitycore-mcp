  method: GetAuraState
  signature: int SpellInfo::GetAuraState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the aura state value associated with the spell
  description: The GetAuraState method retrieves the aura state identifier from a
    SpellInfo object, which determines the specific conditions or states that a spell
    can influence. This value is crucial for understanding how spells interact with
    various game mechanics such as debuffs, buffs, and status effects. The method
    serves as a getter for the aura state field within the spell's configuration data,
    allowing developers to access and evaluate the spell's state properties during
    runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the aura state identifier of the
    spell. This value typically corresponds to specific game states or conditions
    such as ' stun', ' fear', ' silence', or ' root' that can affect gameplay mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nint auraState =\
      \ spellInfo->GetAuraState();\nif (auraState == 1) {\n    // Handle specific\
      \ aura state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine how a spell affects player or creature states. Performance considerations
    are minimal since this is a simple getter function, but care should be taken when
    accessing multiple spell objects simultaneously.
  warnings: The returned value may vary depending on the spell's configuration and
    should not be directly used for determining gameplay effects without proper context.
    Avoid using this method in performance-critical code sections unless necessary.
