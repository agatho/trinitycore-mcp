  brief: Sets the spell that transforms the unit into a specific form.
  description: This method assigns a transform spell to the unit, enabling it to assume
    a particular visual form or state. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft for
    handling transformations such as shapeshifting, polymorph effects, or other visual
    changes that alter the unit's appearance. The method typically triggers the application
    of the specified spell's effects on the unit, which may include visual changes,
    stat modifications, or other gameplay mechanics depending on the spell's properties.

    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();


      // Set transform spell for a druid''s form

      uint32 spellId = 768;


      // Apply the transform spell

      target->SetTransformSpell(spellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell application logic
    and may require additional checks to ensure proper execution. The spell ID should
    be valid and correspond to a known transformation spell within the game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper validation can lead to incorrect
    visual states or gameplay behavior. Care must be taken when applying transform
    spells to avoid conflicts with existing effects or states.
