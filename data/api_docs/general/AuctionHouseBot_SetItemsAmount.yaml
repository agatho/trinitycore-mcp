  class: AuctionHouseBot
  method: SetItemsAmount
  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsAmount(const std::array<uint32, 7> & amounts)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the item amounts for each quality level in the auction house bot's inventory.
  description: 'The SetItemsAmount method configures the number of items that the
    AuctionHouseBot will maintain for each of the seven quality levels (Poor throughLegendary).
    This method is typically used during initialization or configuration of the auction
    house bot to define how many items of each quality should be listed. The input
    array corresponds to quality levels in order: Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic,
    Legendary, and Artifact. Each value in the array represents the desired quantity
    for that quality level.'
  parameters:
  - name: amounts
    description: An array of 7 uint32 values representing the number of items to maintain
      for each quality level (Poor through Artifact). The index 0 corresponds to Poor
      quality, index 1 to Common, and so on up to index 6 for Artifact quality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Item Amounts for All Quality Levels
    code: 'std::array<uint32, 7> itemAmounts = {10, 50, 30, 20, 10, 5, 2};

      AuctionHouseBot bot;

      bot.SetItemsAmount(itemAmounts);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Bot to Maintain Specific Quantities per Quality
    code: 'std::array<uint32, 7> amounts = {0, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 1};

      bot.SetItemsAmount(amounts); // No Poor items, many Common, fewer Rare and higher'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot's inventory management behavior. The
    values provided are used to determine how many items of each quality level should
    be listed on the auction house at any given time. It is recommended to call this
    method during bot initialization or configuration rather than dynamically during
    operation.
  warnings: The array must contain exactly 7 elements; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
    Ensure that values are reasonable for server performance and not excessively high
    to avoid overwhelming the auction house system.
