  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: IsPerformanceAcceptable
  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsPerformanceAcceptable(MetricType type,
    uint64_t value) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether the specified performance metric meets acceptable thresholds
    for bot behavior.
  description: The IsPerformanceAcceptable method checks if a given performance metric
    value is within acceptable limits for the bot system. This method is typically
    used to determine if the current server or system performance allows bots to operate
    without significant degradation in gameplay quality. It evaluates metrics such
    as CPU usage, memory consumption, or frame rate against predefined thresholds.
    The method returns true if the metric is considered acceptable, and false otherwise.
    This functionality helps maintain optimal bot performance and prevents excessive
    resource consumption that could impact overall server stability.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of performance metric being evaluated (e.g., CPU_USAGE,
      MEMORY_USAGE, FRAME_RATE). This parameter determines which threshold values
      are used for comparison.
  - name: value
    description: The actual measured value of the performance metric. This value is
      compared against predefined acceptable thresholds based on the metric type.
  returns: Returns true if the specified performance metric value is within acceptable
    thresholds, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that bot operations
    can proceed without performance concerns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Check
    code: "if (botPerformanceMonitor.IsPerformanceAcceptable(MetricType::CPU_USAGE,\
      \ 75)) {\n    // Proceed with bot activities\n    bot->StartAI();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Pause or reduce bot activity\n    bot->PauseAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "uint64_t currentCpu = GetSystemCpuUsage();\nif (!botPerformanceMonitor.IsPerformanceAcceptable(MetricType::CPU_USAGE,\
      \ currentCpu)) {\n    // Reduce bot count or throttle operations\n    AdjustBotActivityLevel(-1);\n\
      } else if (currentCpu < 30) {\n    // Increase bot activity if performance is\
      \ good\n    AdjustBotActivityLevel(1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal thresholds configured via TrinityCore configuration
    files or runtime settings. The exact threshold values may vary depending on server
    configuration and bot system requirements. The method should be called periodically
    to monitor performance trends rather than as a one-time check.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method too frequently in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve internal calculations or lookups that could impact frame rate.
    Ensure that the metric types passed are valid and supported by the implementation.
