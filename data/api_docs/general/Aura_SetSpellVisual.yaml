  signature: void Aura::SetSpellVisual(const int & spellVisual)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell visual ID for the aura, determining the visual effect displayed
    to players.
  description: The SetSpellVisual method assigns a specific spell visual ID to an
    aura instance, which controls how the aura appears to players in the game world.
    This visual representation is crucial for providing feedback about active buffs,
    debuffs, or other magical effects. The method directly modifies the internal state
    of the aura object and affects the client-side rendering of the spell effect.
    It is typically called during aura initialization or when the visual representation
    needs to be updated dynamically based on game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellVisual
    description: The spell visual ID to assign to this aura. This value corresponds
      to an entry in the SpellVisual.dbc file and determines the specific visual effect
      displayed to players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a spell visual for a custom aura
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetSpellVisual(9876);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating spell visual based on aura stack count
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(54321);\nif (aura)\n{\n    uint32 stackCount\
      \ = aura->GetStackAmount();\n    uint32 visualId = (stackCount > 5) ? 1111 :\
      \ 2222;\n    aura->SetSpellVisual(visualId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active auras that are already applied
    to a unit. The spell visual ID must correspond to a valid entry in the SpellVisual.dbc
    file or the visual effect may not display correctly. Changes made via this method
    will immediately update the client-side visualization without requiring additional
    network synchronization.
  warnings: Calling SetSpellVisual on an aura that has been removed from its target
    unit may cause undefined behavior. The spell visual ID should be validated against
    the SpellVisual.dbc file to ensure it exists and is appropriate for the context
    of the aura being modified.
