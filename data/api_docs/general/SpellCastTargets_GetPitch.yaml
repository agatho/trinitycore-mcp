  method: GetPitch
  signature: float SpellCastTargets::GetPitch() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the pitch angle of the target position in radians.
  description: The GetPitch method retrieves the vertical angle (pitch) component
    from the SpellCastTargets object. This angle represents the upward or downward
    tilt from the horizontal plane, typically used in spell targeting calculations
    where precise directional control is required. The returned value is expressed
    in radians and corresponds to the angle between the horizontal plane and the line
    of sight toward the target position. This method is commonly used in spell systems
    that require accurate targeting mechanics, such as area-of-effect spells or projectile-based
    attacks where elevation plays a role.
  parameters: []
  returns: "A float value representing the pitch angle in radians. Positive values\
    \ indicate an upward tilt, while negative values indicate a downward tilt. The\
    \ value typically ranges from -\u03C0/2 to \u03C0/2 radians (or -90 to 90 degrees)."
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Spell Targeting
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set target position ...\nfloat pitch\
      \ = targets.GetPitch();\n// Use pitch value for spell effect calculations\n\
      if (pitch > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Apply upward targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating Pitch with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void CastSpellWithPitch(Spell* spell, Unit* caster, SpellCastTargets* targets)\n\
      {\n    float pitch = targets->GetPitch();\n    float yaw = targets->GetYaw();\n\
      \    \n    // Adjust spell effect based on target angle\n    if (abs(pitch)\
      \ > 0.785f) // ~45 degrees\n    {\n        // Apply special handling for steep\
      \ angles\n        spell->SetEffectRadius(15.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The pitch value returned by this method is calculated based on the target
    position relative to the caster's position. It assumes a standard coordinate system
    where positive Y represents upward direction. This method may return zero if no
    valid target position has been set or if the target is directly horizontal with
    respect to the caster.
  warnings: Be aware that pitch values are in radians, not degrees. If you need degree-based
    calculations, remember to convert using 'degrees = radians * (180.0f / M_PI)'.
    Also, ensure that the SpellCastTargets object has been properly initialized with
    a valid target position before calling this method to avoid unexpected results.
