documentation:
  brief: Returns the stationary position index of the game object.
  description: This method retrieves the stationary position index associated with
    a GameObject instance, which represents the specific location where the game object
    is placed in the world. The stationary position index is used to determine the
    exact coordinates and orientation of the object within the game world, particularly
    for objects that are fixed in place or have specific positioning requirements.
    This method is typically used during object initialization or when determining
    the object's placement within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the stationary position index as an integer reference, representing
    the unique identifier for the object's fixed position in the world.
