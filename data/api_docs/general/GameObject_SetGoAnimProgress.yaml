  signature: void GameObject::SetGoAnimProgress(uint8 animprogress)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the animation progress of a game object to a specified value.
  description: This method updates the animation progress state of a GameObject instance,
    allowing developers to control the visual representation of game object animations.
    The animation progress is typically used for handling object states like doors,
    levers, or other interactive elements that have animated transitions. This method
    directly modifies the internal animation state of the GameObject without requiring
    additional synchronization or external calls.
  parameters:
  - name: animprogress
    description: The animation progress value to set, ranging from 0 to 255. This
      represents the percentage completion of an animation cycle, where 0 indicates
      no progress and 255 indicates full progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetGoAnimProgress(128);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with animation state management
    code: "GameObject* go = GetGameObject();\nuint8 progress = 255;\nif (go)\n{\n\
      \    go->SetGoAnimProgress(progress);\n}\n// This would set the object to full\
      \ animation progress"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the GameObject's internal animation state.
    It should be used carefully as it bypasses normal game object lifecycle management
    and may cause visual inconsistencies if not properly handled. The animation progress
    value is typically managed by the game server to ensure proper synchronization
    with client-side animations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual artifacts or inconsistent
    animation states. It should only be called when the GameObject's animation state
    needs to be explicitly controlled, such as during scripted events or when handling
    specific game mechanics like door opening/closing.
