documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of quest currency rewards associated with a creature.
  description: The GetCreatureQuestCurrencyList method fetches an array of integers
    representing the quest currency IDs that are rewarded when a specific creature
    is involved in a quest. This function is typically used to determine what currency
    items (such as gold, reputation tokens, or other in-game currencies) can be obtained
    from completing quests related to a particular creature. The returned pointer
    points to an internal static array and should not be modified or freed by the
    caller. If no quest currency is associated with the given creature ID, the method
    may return a null pointer or an empty list depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing the IDs of quest currencies
    associated with the specified creature. The array should be treated as read-only
    and its contents are valid only until the next call to this method or until the
    ObjectMgr instance is destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Currency List for a Creature
    code: "uint32 creatureId = 12345;\nconst int* currencyList = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureQuestCurrencyList(creatureId);\n\
      if (currencyList != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; currencyList[i] != 0; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Currency ID: %d\\n\", currencyList[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that map creature IDs to quest
    currency rewards. It is recommended to cache results if the same creature's currency
    list is accessed frequently to avoid repeated lookups. The returned array is null-terminated,
    but the exact structure and termination condition may vary based on how the data
    is populated in the ObjectMgr.
  warnings: Do not modify or free the memory pointed to by the return value as it
    points to internal static storage. Be cautious when using this method with invalid
    creature IDs; behavior might be undefined or result in a null pointer.
