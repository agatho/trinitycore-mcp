  class: AOEZone
  method: IsPointInZone
  signature: bool AOEZone::IsPointInZone(const int & point, uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given point is within the boundaries of an area of effect
    zone.
  description: The IsPointInZone method evaluates whether a specified point lies inside
    the defined area of effect zone. This functionality is commonly used in spell
    and ability systems to check if targets or effects are within designated regions.
    The method takes into account the current time to potentially handle time-sensitive
    zones, such as those that may expire or change state over time. It returns a boolean
    value indicating inclusion or exclusion of the point within the zone's boundaries.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific point in the game world,
      likely corresponding to a coordinate or node within the AOEZone's spatial structure.
  - name: currentTime
    description: A uint32 value representing the current timestamp, used to evaluate
      time-dependent properties of the zone such as duration or dynamic changes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified point is within the boundaries of the AOEZone
    at the given time; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AOEZone zone;\nuint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nbool isInZone\
      \ = zone.IsPointInZone(12345, currentTime);\nif (isInZone) {\n    // Process\
      \ logic for point inside the zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Points
    code: "AOEZone zone;\nuint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nstd::vector<int>\
      \ points = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (const auto& point : points) {\n    if (zone.IsPointInZone(point,\
      \ currentTime)) {\n        // Handle point inside the zone\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial calculations or uses precomputed data
    structures to efficiently determine point inclusion. The 'point' parameter may
    be interpreted as a unique identifier rather than a direct coordinate, depending
    on how AOEZone is implemented internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the point identifier passed corresponds to valid entries in
    the zone's internal structure; invalid identifiers could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
