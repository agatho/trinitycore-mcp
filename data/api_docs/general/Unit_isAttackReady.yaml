  class: Unit
  method: isAttackReady
  signature: bool Unit::isAttackReady(int type) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a unit's attack is ready to be executed.
  description: The isAttackReady method checks whether a unit's primary attack is
    currently available for execution. This method is commonly used in combat scenarios
    to determine if a character can perform their next attack, taking into account
    the current attack speed and cooldown period. It returns true when the attack
    is ready, false otherwise. The method is typically called during combat situations
    to ensure proper timing of attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of attack to check. This parameter determines which attack
      timing to evaluate, such as melee, ranged, or spell-based attacks. Values are
      typically 0 for melee, 1 for ranged, and 2 for spell attacks.
  returns: Returns true if the unit's attack is ready to be executed, false otherwise.
    The method will return false when the attack is on cooldown or when the unit is
    not in a combat state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->isAttackReady(0)) {\n    // Perform melee attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (unit->isAttackReady(1) && unit->GetVictim()) {\n    // Perform ranged\
      \ attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to determine when a unit can perform its next attack. It's important to note that
    the method may return false even if the unit has no active cooldown, depending
    on the game mechanics and specific implementation.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking if
    a unit is in combat state, as it only evaluates attack readiness and not overall
    combat status. Also, the method might behave differently based on the type of
    attack being checked.
