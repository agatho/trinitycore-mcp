  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetHostileCasts
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::GetHostileCasts() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of hostile casts currently active in the interrupt awareness
    system.
  description: The GetHostileCasts method returns an integer representing the number
    of hostile spell casts that are currently being tracked by the interrupt awareness
    system for the associated unit. This value is typically used by AI scripts and
    combat logic to determine when to attempt spell interruption or when to react
    to incoming hostile spells. The method does not perform any side effects and simply
    retrieves a cached or calculated count of active hostile casts. It's important
    to note that this count may be updated dynamically as new hostile casts are detected
    or existing ones are completed or interrupted.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of currently active hostile casts
    being tracked by the interrupt awareness system. A return value of 0 indicates
    no hostile casts are currently being monitored, while positive values indicate
    the number of hostile spells that may be interrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (me->GetInterruptAwareness()->GetHostileCasts()\
      \ > 0)\n        {\n            // Perform interrupt logic\n            DoInterruptSpell();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interrupt Logic
    code: "if (me->GetInterruptAwareness()->GetHostileCasts() >= 3)\n{\n    // Avoid\
      \ casting interrupt spells if too many hostile casts are active\n    DoNotInterrupt();\n\
      }\nelse if (me->GetInterruptAwareness()->GetHostileCasts() > 0)\n{\n    // Attempt\
      \ to interrupt one of the hostile casts\n    TryInterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interrupt awareness
    functionality such as tracking specific cast targets or determining optimal timing
    for spell interruption. The returned value reflects the current state of the interrupt
    awareness system and may change between calls if new hostile casts are detected
    or existing ones are interrupted or completed.
  warnings: The method should not be used to make assumptions about the actual spell
    being cast, as it only provides a count. Additionally, relying on this value for
    critical combat decisions without considering other factors such as spell priority
    or cooldowns may lead to suboptimal AI behavior.
