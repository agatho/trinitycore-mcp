  signature: time_t World::GetNextDailyQuestsResetTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Unix timestamp for the next reset time of daily
    quests in the World.
  description: The GetNextDailyQuestsResetTime method determines the exact time when
    daily quest resets will occur in the game world. This is typically used to synchronize
    client UI elements, such as displaying countdown timers or updating quest status
    indicators. The returned timestamp represents the next occurrence of the daily
    reset, which usually happens at a fixed time each day (e.g., 00:00 server time).
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational, making
    it safe for frequent calls. It relies on the server's configured reset time settings
    and accounts for the current server time to compute the next reset point.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of the next daily quests
    reset time. This value can be used directly with standard C/C++ time functions
    like localtime() or strftime() to format and display the reset time to players.
  examples:
  - title: Display Next Daily Quest Reset Time
    code: "#include <iostream>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    time_t nextReset\
      \ = sWorld->GetNextDailyQuestsResetTime();\n    std::tm* resetTime = std::localtime(&nextReset);\n\
      \    char buffer[100];\n    std::strftime(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%Y-%m-%d\
      \ %H:%M:%S\", resetTime);\n    std::cout << \"Next daily quest reset: \" <<\
      \ buffer << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any locks or synchronization
    primitives. It uses the internal server time configuration to determine reset
    points, so it will accurately reflect the configured daily reset schedule regardless
    of client time zones.
