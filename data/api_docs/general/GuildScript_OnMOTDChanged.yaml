  signature: void GuildScript::OnMOTDChanged(Guild * guild, const std::string & newMotd)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a guild's Message of the Day (MOTD) is changed, allowing scripts
    to react to the update.
  description: The OnMOTDChanged method is a callback function in the GuildScript
    class that is triggered whenever a guild's Message of the Day (MOTD) is modified
    by a guild leader or officer. This method allows custom scripts to perform actions
    such as logging the change, sending notifications to players, or updating external
    systems when the MOTD is updated. The method receives a pointer to the affected
    guild and the new MOTD string as parameters. It is part of TrinityCore's scripting
    system that enables developers to extend or modify guild behavior without modifying
    core game code.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to the Guild object whose MOTD has been changed. This parameter
      provides access to all guild-related data and methods for the affected guild.
  - name: newMotd
    description: The new Message of the Day string that was set for the guild. This
      string contains the updated MOTD text as entered by the guild leader or officer.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnMOTDChanged(Guild*\
      \ guild, const std::string& newMotd) override\n    {\n        LOG_INFO(\"guild\"\
      , \"MOTD changed for guild '{}' to: {}\", guild->GetName(), newMotd);\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast MOTD Change to Guild Members
    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnMOTDChanged(Guild*\
      \ guild, const std::string& newMotd) override\n    {\n        for (auto const&\
      \ member : guild->GetMembers())\n        {\n            if (Player* player =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(member.GetGuid()))\n            {\n  \
      \              ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"Guild MOTD\
      \ has been updated.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the game's core guild management system,
    typically after a successful MOTD update. It runs in the main thread and should
    avoid long-running operations to prevent performance issues. The guild pointer
    passed to this function is guaranteed to be valid during execution.
  warnings: Do not modify the guild state or attempt to change the MOTD again within
    this callback, as it may lead to recursion or unexpected behavior. Be cautious
    with logging or network operations that could impact server performance under
    high load.
