documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes target limit parameters for spell effects.
  description: This method sets up the maximum target limits for spells, including
    both dimished and non-diminished targets. It handles the configuration of target
    count limits based on spell and effect data, ensuring proper targeting mechanics
    for various spell effects within the TrinityCore framework. The method is crucial
    for maintaining accurate spell targeting behavior in World of Warcraft.

  - name: maxTargets
    description: Maximum number of targets allowed for the spell effect
  - name: numNonDiminishedTargets
    description: Number of non-diminished targets for the spell effect
  - name: maxTargetsValueHolderSpell
    description: Reference to the spell that holds maximum target values
  - name: maxTargetsValueHolderEffect
    description: Reference to the effect that holds maximum target values
  - name: numNonDiminishedTargetsValueHolderSpell
    description: Reference to the spell that holds non-diminished target values
  - name: numNonDiminishedTargetsValueHolderEffect
    description: Reference to the effect that holds non-diminished target values
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = new SpellInfo();

      spellInfo->_LoadSqrtTargetLimit(5, 3, 100, 200, 150, 250);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell initialization phase and requires
    proper data validation to ensure correct target limits are applied. The method
    handles both dimensional and non-dimensional targets correctly.
  warnings: Improper parameter values can lead to incorrect targeting behavior, potentially
    causing spells to target too many or too few targets.
