api:
  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: GetTeamIdByTeam
  signature: int OutdoorPvP::GetTeamIdByTeam(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID corresponding to the specified team value.
  description: The GetTeamIdByTeam method maps a given team identifier to its corresponding
    internal team ID used within the OutdoorPvP system. This method is typically utilized
    to translate between different representations of team affiliations, such as converting
    a player's team enum or faction ID into the internal team ID format required by
    OutdoorPvP operations. The method ensures consistency in team identification across
    various game systems and PvP mechanics. It is commonly called during PvP event
    handling, zone-based team checks, and when determining player affiliations within
    outdoor battlegrounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the internal team ID. Possible values are
    typically 0 or 1, where 0 usually represents the Alliance team and 1 represents
    the Horde team, though exact mapping may depend on implementation details of the
    specific OutdoorPvP instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPById(1);\nif (pvp)\n{\n\
      \    int teamId = pvp->GetTeamIdByTeam(0); // Returns 0 for Alliance\n    //\
      \ Use teamId in further PvP logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal mappings or lookup tables to convert
    between different team representations. The implementation may cache results for
    performance reasons, especially since this method is called frequently during
    PvP events and zone updates.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes an integer parameter but the documentation
    says 'None'. This discrepancy suggests either a miscommunication in the provided
    information or that the parameter name was omitted from the signature. Ensure
    correct usage of the parameter value to avoid incorrect team mappings.
