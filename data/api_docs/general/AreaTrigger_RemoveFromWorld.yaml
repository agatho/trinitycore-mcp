  method: RemoveFromWorld
  signature: void AreaTrigger::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the area trigger from the game world, making it no longer active
    or visible to players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method is responsible for removing an AreaTrigger
    object from the active game world state. This operation typically occurs when
    the area trigger's duration expires, its conditions are no longer met, or it is
    explicitly destroyed by the server logic. The method ensures that the area trigger
    is properly unregistered from all relevant systems including the map manager,
    player detection systems, and any associated event handlers. Once removed, the
    area trigger will no longer process updates or interact with players in the world.
    This method is usually called internally by the TrinityCore framework during normal
    operation and should not typically be invoked directly by external code unless
    specifically required for custom behavior.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in area trigger expiration
    code: "void AreaTrigger::OnExpire()\n{\n    // Remove the area trigger from the\
      \ world when it expires\n    RemoveFromWorld();\n    // Clean up any associated\
      \ resources\n    Delete();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom area trigger cleanup
    code: "class CustomAreaTrigger : public AreaTrigger\n{\npublic:\n    void Deactivate()\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform custom cleanup before removing from world\n     \
      \   SendCustomEvent();\n        RemoveFromWorld();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the area trigger is no longer needed
    in the game world. It performs necessary cleanup operations including removing
    references from the map manager and notifying any dependent systems. The method
    assumes that all necessary preconditions for removal have been satisfied before
    being invoked.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld on an already removed area trigger may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the trigger's state before calling
    this method, especially in custom implementations where direct invocation might
    occur.
