  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetCacheDuration
  signature: uint32 PathfindingManager::GetCacheDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cache duration value used by the pathfinding manager for storing
    and retrieving path data.
  description: The GetCacheDuration method retrieves the configured cache duration
    in seconds that determines how long pathfinding results are stored before being
    considered stale. This value is crucial for balancing performance and accuracy
    in pathfinding calculations, as it affects how frequently the system needs to
    recalculate paths versus using cached results. The returned value represents the
    maximum age of cached paths in seconds, after which they are invalidated and regenerated
    when needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the cache duration in seconds. This indicates
    how long pathfinding results will be retained before being discarded and recalculated.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve current cache duration
    code: 'uint32 cacheDuration = sPathfinder->GetCacheDuration();

      TC_LOG_INFO("pathfinding", "Current path cache duration: {} seconds", cacheDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used to monitor or adjust pathfinding performance
    characteristics. The cache duration directly impacts memory usage and calculation
    overhead - longer durations use more memory but reduce CPU load from repeated
    calculations.
