  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: CalculateInterrupterScore
  signature: float InterruptRotationManager::CalculateInterrupterScore(const InterrupterBot
    & interrupter, const ActiveCast & cast) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a scoring value for an interrupter bot based on the target cast.
  description: The CalculateInterrupterScore method evaluates and returns a float
    score that represents how effectively a given interrupter bot can interrupt a
    specific active cast. This score is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    to determine the priority or effectiveness of using an interrupt ability against
    a particular spell or cast. The calculation may consider factors such as cast
    time, interrupt resistance, bot skill level, and other relevant combat mechanics.
    The method is designed to be called during active combat scenarios where interrupt
    decisions are required.
  parameters:
  - name: interrupter
    description: A reference to the InterrupterBot object that represents the bot
      attempting to perform an interrupt. This object contains information about the
      bot's abilities, current state, and capabilities.
  - name: cast
    description: A reference to the ActiveCast object representing the spell or ability
      currently being cast by the target. This includes details such as cast duration,
      spell ID, and other casting properties that influence interruptibility.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated interrupt score. Higher scores
    typically indicate a more effective or viable interrupt opportunity. The exact
    scoring logic is implementation-specific but generally reflects factors like cast
    time, interrupt potential, and bot capability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in interrupt decision making
    code: "float score = rotationManager.CalculateInterrupterScore(interrupterBot,\
      \ activeCast);\nif (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the cast\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using score to compare multiple interrupt options
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nInterrupterBot* bestInterrupter = nullptr;\nfor\
      \ (auto& bot : interrupterBots) {\n    float score = rotationManager.CalculateInterrupterScore(bot,\
      \ activeCast);\n    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n \
      \       bestInterrupter = &bot;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestInterrupter to perform\
      \ the interrupt"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system for managing spell interrupts
    in TrinityCore. The scoring algorithm may be tuned based on game balance and specific
    bot behavior configurations. It's important to note that this method assumes valid
    input objects (non-null references) to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both the interrupter and cast parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method. Passing null or invalid references can lead to crashes
    or incorrect scoring results. The score returned should not be directly used for
    interrupt execution without additional validation checks.
