  class: DifficultyCurve
  method: DifficultyCurve
  signature: void DifficultyCurve::DifficultyCurve(float initialDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a difficulty curve with the specified initial difficulty value.
  description: The DifficultyCurve constructor initializes a difficulty scaling curve
    object using the provided initial difficulty parameter. This curve is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to dynamically adjust enemy difficulty,
    loot drops, and experience rewards based on player progression or encounter settings.
    The initial difficulty value sets the baseline for subsequent calculations within
    the curve. This method does not return any value as it is a constructor initializing
    internal state variables.
  parameters:
  - name: initialDifficulty
    description: A floating-point value representing the starting difficulty level
      for the curve. This value typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents
      the lowest difficulty and 1.0 represents maximum difficulty. Valid values are
      usually within the range [0.0, 1.0], though exact constraints depend on game
      mechanics implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve(0.5f);

      // Initializes a difficulty curve with baseline difficulty of 50%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Difficulty Levels
    code: 'DifficultyCurve easyCurve(0.2f);

      DifficultyCurve hardCurve(0.8f);

      // Creates two curves with different starting difficulties for varied encounters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object instantiation and should only
    be invoked once per DifficultyCurve instance. The internal curve implementation
    may use interpolation or mathematical functions to scale difficulty values over
    time or player progression. Developers should ensure that the initialDifficulty
    parameter is within expected bounds for proper game balance.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the initialDifficulty value can lead to unbalanced
    gameplay experiences, such as encounters that are too easy or too difficult. This
    constructor does not validate input parameters, so developers must ensure valid
    values are passed. Avoid calling this constructor multiple times on the same object
    instance as it may cause undefined behavior.
