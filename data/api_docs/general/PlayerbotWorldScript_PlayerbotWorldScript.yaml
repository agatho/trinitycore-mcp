documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerbotWorldScript class for managing
    player bot behavior in the world.
  description: The PlayerbotWorldScript constructor initializes the necessary components
    and data structures required for handling player bot interactions within the TrinityCore
    world environment. This method sets up internal state management, registers event
    handlers, and prepares the script for processing player bot actions, AI decisions,
    and world events. It is automatically called when a new PlayerbotWorldScript instance
    is created and ensures that all required systems are properly initialized before
    the script begins executing. The initialization process includes setting up configuration
    parameters, establishing communication channels with the core game systems, and
    preparing data structures needed for bot behavior management.

  - title: Creating a PlayerbotWorldScript Instance
    code: 'PlayerbotWorldScript* script = new PlayerbotWorldScript();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all necessary components

      // for managing player bot behavior in the world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method and should not be called directly. It's automatically
    invoked when creating new instances of PlayerbotWorldScript. The initialization
    process may involve loading configuration files, setting up internal data structures,
    and registering with the core TrinityCore systems.
