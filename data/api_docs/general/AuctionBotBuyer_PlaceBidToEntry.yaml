  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: PlaceBidToEntry
  signature: void AuctionBotBuyer::PlaceBidToEntry(int * auction, int * auctionHouse,
    uint32 bidPrice)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on an auction entry using the specified auction and auction
    house identifiers.
  description: The PlaceBidToEntry method is responsible for placing a bid on a specific
    auction item within the Auction House system. It takes in pointers to an auction
    identifier and an auction house identifier, along with the bid price to be placed.
    This method is typically used by the Auction Bot system to automatically participate
    in auctions based on configured rules. The method does not return any value but
    modifies the state of the auction through the game's internal systems. It assumes
    that the necessary validation has been performed prior to calling this function,
    such as ensuring the bidder has sufficient funds and the auction is still active.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the auction
      entry to bid on. This value corresponds to the auction's database ID.
  - name: auctionHouse
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the auction
      house where the auction is taking place. This typically maps to a specific AuctionHouseEntry
      in the game data.
  - name: bidPrice
    description: The bid price to place on the auction item, specified as a uint32
      value. Must be greater than or equal to the current bid amount for the auction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int auctionId = 12345;

      int auctionHouseId = 7;

      uint32 bidAmount = 50000;

      AuctionBotBuyer buyer;

      buyer.PlaceBidToEntry(&auctionId, &auctionHouseId, bidAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Auction Bot system and should only be called when
    the bot is configured to participate in auctions. The actual auction processing
    occurs asynchronously within the game's core systems. Ensure that all preconditions
    are met before invoking this method, including sufficient funds and valid auction
    state.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid auction or auction house IDs as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the bid price is
    higher than the current highest bid to avoid placing invalid bids.
