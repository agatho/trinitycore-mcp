  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: HandleDynamicGroupChanges
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleDynamicGroupChanges(Group * group, Player
    * newMember)
documentation:
  brief: Handles dynamic group changes within instance coordination, updating member
    lists and synchronization states when a new player joins a group.
  description: The HandleDynamicGroupChanges method is responsible for managing real-time
    updates to group membership within the instance coordination system. When a new
    player joins an existing group, this method ensures that all relevant systems
    are notified and synchronized accordingly. It typically handles tasks such as
    updating internal group data structures, notifying other players in the instance
    of the new member, and potentially adjusting instance-specific configurations
    or permissions. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency between
    the game's group management system and its instance-based content handling.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that has undergone a dynamic change.
      This represents the group whose membership is being updated, including any new
      members added.
  - name: newMember
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the newly added member
      to the group. This player will be integrated into the instance coordination
      system and may trigger further synchronization processes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void AddPlayerToGroup(Group* group, Player* newPlayer) {\n    if (group\
      \ && newPlayer) {\n        sInstanceCoordination->HandleDynamicGroupChanges(group,\
      \ newPlayer);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Join Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerGroupJoin(Player* player, Group* group) {\n    if (player\
      \ && group && group->IsLeader(player)) {\n        sInstanceCoordination->HandleDynamicGroupChanges(group,\
      \ player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a new member is added to an existing
    group that is participating in instance coordination. It assumes the group and
    player pointers are valid and not null. The implementation may involve internal
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during concurrent access.
  warnings: Ensure that both group and newMember parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as passing invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that this method might trigger additional network messages or instance
    state updates, which could impact performance if called frequently in rapid succession.
