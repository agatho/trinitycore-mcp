documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotPerformanceMonitor object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotPerformanceMonitor class copies
    all member data from the source BotPerformanceMonitor object to the current object.
    This method is typically used when you need to replace the contents of one performance
    monitor instance with those of another. The operation performs a deep copy of
    all relevant performance tracking data, ensuring that the target object becomes
    an independent copy of the source. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this would be used to transfer performance monitoring state between different
    bot instances or to reset a monitor's state from another monitor's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotPerformanceMonitor object whose contents will be copied
      to the current object
  returns: A reference to the current BotPerformanceMonitor object, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor1;

      BotPerformanceMonitor monitor2;

      // ... initialize monitor1 with some data

      monitor2 = monitor1; // Assigns all contents from monitor1 to monitor2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor m1, m2, m3;

      // ... initialize objects with data

      m3 = m2 = m1; // Chained assignment - m2 and m3 both get contents from m1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs a deep copy of all internal performance tracking
    data structures. The implementation should handle potential memory management
    considerations when copying complex data members. In TrinityCore's bot system
    context, this operation may be used during bot initialization or state synchronization.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large BotPerformanceMonitor objects as it may
    involve significant memory copying operations. Ensure that the source object remains
    valid for the duration of the assignment operation to avoid undefined behavior.
