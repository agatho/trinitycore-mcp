  class: ManaSoulShardResourceDemo
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ManaSoulShardResourceDemo::Consume(uint32 manaCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes mana soul shards to reduce the player's mana cost.
  description: The Consume method attempts to deduct the specified amount of mana
    from the player's current mana pool. It returns true if the operation was successful,
    indicating that sufficient mana was available and has been consumed. If there
    is insufficient mana or the operation fails for any reason, it returns false without
    modifying the mana pool. This method is typically used in conjunction with spell
    casting or ability usage mechanics where mana consumption is required.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCost
    description: The amount of mana to be consumed from the player's resource pool.
      Must be a positive integer value representing the mana cost of an ability or
      spell.
  returns: Returns true if the specified mana amount was successfully deducted from
    the player's mana pool; otherwise, returns false if there is insufficient mana
    or another failure occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mana Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetManaSoulShardResourceDemo()->Consume(50)) {\n    // Mana\
      \ successfully consumed\n    SendChatMessage(\"Mana consumed successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Not enough mana\n    SendChatMessage(\"Not enough mana\
      \ to cast the spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Casting with Mana Check
    code: "uint32 spellManaCost = 100;\nif (player->GetManaSoulShardResourceDemo()->Consume(spellManaCost))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell effect\n    CastSpell(player, SPELL_ID_FIREBALL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle insufficient mana case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not have enough mana to cast this spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the underlying mana system is properly initialized
    and that the player has access to a valid mana resource pool. The method does
    not directly interact with the database or persist changes; it only modifies in-memory
    values.
  warnings: Ensure that the mana cost value passed to this method is validated before
    calling, as negative values may cause unexpected behavior or errors depending
    on implementation details of the mana system.
