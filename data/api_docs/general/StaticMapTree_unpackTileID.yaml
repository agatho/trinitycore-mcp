  class: StaticMapTree
  method: unpackTileID
  signature: void StaticMapTree::unpackTileID(uint32 ID, uint32 & tileX, uint32 &
    tileY)
documentation:
  brief: Unpacks a tile identifier into its corresponding X and Y coordinates within
    the static map tree.
  description: The unpackTileID method decomposes a single 32-bit tile identifier
    into two 32-bit unsigned integers representing the X and Y grid coordinates of
    the tile. This functionality is essential for mapping and spatial queries within
    TrinityCore's static map system, where tiles are uniquely identified by a combined
    coordinate value. The method assumes that the input ID encodes the X and Y coordinates
    in a specific bit layout, typically with X occupying the lower bits and Y the
    upper bits. It is commonly used when iterating over or accessing specific map
    tiles for collision detection, navigation, or terrain data retrieval.
  parameters:
  - name: ID
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the packed tile identifier
      containing both X and Y coordinates.
  - name: tileX
    description: Reference to a 32-bit unsigned integer that will be set to the X
      coordinate of the unpacked tile.
  - name: tileY
    description: Reference to a 32-bit unsigned integer that will be set to the Y
      coordinate of the unpacked tile.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 packedID = 0x12345678;

      uint32 x, y;

      staticMapTree.unpackTileID(packedID, x, y);

      // x will be set to 0x5678, y will be set to 0x1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with packTileID and assumes
    a fixed bit layout for encoding tile coordinates. The exact bit arrangement depends
    on the implementation details of the StaticMapTree class, which may vary between
    different versions or configurations of TrinityCore.
