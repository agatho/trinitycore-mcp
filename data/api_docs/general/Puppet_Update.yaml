  class: Puppet
  method: Update
  signature: void Puppet::Update(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the puppet's state and behavior based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Puppet::Update method is responsible for advancing the internal
    state of a puppet object, typically used in conjunction with AI behaviors or scripted
    events. This method processes any pending actions, updates timers, and ensures
    that the puppet responds appropriately to changes in the game world over time.
    It is commonly called by the core game loop at regular intervals to maintain consistent
    behavior and responsiveness. The update process may include pathfinding, animation
    state transitions, or triggering events based on elapsed time.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update
      call. This value is used to calculate time-based behaviors such as movement
      speed, cooldowns, and event timing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Puppet Update Usage
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    static uint32\
      \ lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 deltaTime = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n    \n\
      \    if (deltaTime >= 100) // Update every 100ms\n    {\n        puppet->Update(deltaTime);\n\
      \        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Puppet Update in AI Context
    code: "class PuppetAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (me->IsInCombat())\n            puppet->Update(diff);\n\
      \        else\n            puppet->Update(diff);\n        \n        // Additional\
      \ AI logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should be called
    regularly to maintain proper puppet behavior. The time parameter must represent
    actual elapsed milliseconds for accurate timing of timed events. Puppet update
    logic may include processing of queued actions, state transitions, and interaction
    with other game entities.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect time values can cause erratic behavior
    or timing issues in the puppet's AI. Ensure that the time parameter accurately
    reflects real-world elapsed time to avoid synchronization problems with other
    game systems.
