  signature: std::shared_ptr<Trigger> TriggerFactory::CreateTrigger(const std::string
    & name)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new Trigger instance with the specified name.
  description: The CreateTrigger method is responsible for instantiating a new Trigger
    object within the TrinityCore framework. This factory method allocates memory
    for the trigger, initializes its properties based on the provided name, and returns
    a shared pointer to the newly created object. The method is typically used during
    quest initialization, event handling, or scripted trigger creation in World of
    Warcraft's game logic. It ensures proper memory management through smart pointers
    and follows the standard factory pattern for object creation. The returned Trigger
    instance can then be used to define conditions, actions, or events that occur
    within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier that specifies the type or purpose of the trigger
      to be created. This name is typically used to look up predefined trigger configurations
      or templates within the system.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<Trigger> pointing to the newly created Trigger instance.
    Returns a valid pointer if successful, or an empty shared_ptr (nullptr) if the
    trigger creation fails due to invalid name or resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Creation
    code: "auto trigger = TriggerFactory::CreateTrigger(\"QuestCompleteTrigger\");\n\
      if (trigger)\n{\n    // Use the trigger for quest completion logic\n    trigger->SetCondition([]()\
      \ { return true; });\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Trigger Creation with Error Handling
    code: "std::string triggerName = \"PlayerEnterAreaTrigger\";\nauto trigger = TriggerFactory::CreateTrigger(triggerName);\n\
      \nif (!trigger)\n{\n    // Handle error case - invalid trigger name or allocation\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create trigger: %s\", triggerName.c_str());\n\
      \    return false;\n}\n\n// Configure the trigger\ntrigger->SetAction([]() {\n\
      \    // Trigger action code here\n});\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method uses a factory pattern to ensure proper instantiation of Trigger
    objects. It's important to note that this method may throw exceptions or return
    nullptr if the specified trigger name is not recognized or if memory allocation
    fails. The returned shared_ptr automatically manages the lifetime of the Trigger
    object, preventing memory leaks when multiple references exist.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unrecognized name may result in
    a null pointer being returned. Always check for null before using the returned
    Trigger instance. Additionally, since this is a factory method, it should not
    be called from performance-critical code paths without considering potential overhead
    from object creation and lookup operations.
