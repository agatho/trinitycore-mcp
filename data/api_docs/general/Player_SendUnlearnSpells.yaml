documentation:
  brief: Sends unlearn spells command to player
  description: This method sends a request to unlearn spells to the player, typically
    used in conjunction with spell learning mechanics within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework. It allows players to remove learned spells from their character's spellbook,
    effectively resetting their spell knowledge and allowing them to relearn spells
    through various means such as trainers or quest rewards. The method is part of
    the general player functionality and handles the communication between client
    and server for spell unlearning operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendUnlearnSpells();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal server-side logic for spell removal,
    which may involve updating the player's spellbook state and sending appropriate
    packets to client. Implementation details are not fully available but it is expected
    to be part of the broader spell management system.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to incorrect spellbook states or
    unexpected behavior during spell learning. It should only be called when necessary,
    such as after completing a quest or when resetting a character's spell knowledge.
