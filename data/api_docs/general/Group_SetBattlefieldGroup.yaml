  class: Group
  method: SetBattlefieldGroup
  signature: void Group::SetBattlefieldGroup(Battlefield * bf)
documentation:
  brief: Associates a group with a battlefield instance.
  description: The SetBattlefieldGroup method assigns a Battlefield pointer to the
    group, linking the group to a specific battlefield instance. This is typically
    used during battlefield initialization or when a group is being added to a battlefield
    queue. The method sets internal state within the Group class to track which battlefield
    the group is associated with. This association is crucial for battlefield-related
    operations such as group tracking, reward distribution, and objective handling.
  parameters:
  - name: bf
    description: Pointer to the Battlefield instance that the group should be associated
      with. Can be nullptr to disassociate the group from any battlefield.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Associate Group with Battlefield
    code: "Battlefield* battlefield = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (battlefield)\n{\n    group->SetBattlefieldGroup(battlefield);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disassociate Group from Battlefield
    code: group->SetBattlefieldGroup(nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battlefield management
    system. It's important to ensure that the Battlefield pointer passed is valid
    and properly initialized before calling this method. The group's battlefield association
    affects various battlefield-related operations including quest handling, loot
    distribution, and player tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will disassociate the group from
    any active battlefield. Ensure proper synchronization when modifying battlefield
    associations in multi-threaded environments. Incorrect usage may lead to inconsistent
    group state during battlefield events.
