  class: ClearcastingTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool ClearcastingTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the clearcasting effect is currently active on the caster.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a character currently has the clearcasting
    buff applied. Clearcasting is a spell proc that allows a mage to cast spells without
    consuming mana or triggering certain cooldowns. This method is typically used
    in spell processing logic to modify behavior based on whether the clearcasting
    state is active. The check is performed against the current state of the caster's
    aura application and does not account for temporary modifications or external
    effects that might alter the buff status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the clearcasting effect is currently active on the caster,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (caster->GetClearcastingTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply special\
      \ logic for clearcasting state\n    spell->SetManaCost(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Clearcasting Status Before Casting
    code: "Spell* spell = caster->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_CAST_SPELL);\nif (spell\
      \ && caster->GetClearcastingTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Modify spell properties\n\
      \    spell->SetChanneling(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the ClearcastingTracker
    class. It should be called after any potential changes to the aura status, such
    as spell casts or aura updates, to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell will always respect clearcasting if this method
    returns true; additional logic may be required to properly implement the buff's
    effects in spell processing.
