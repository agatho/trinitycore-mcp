  signature: AccountTypes WhoListPlayerInfo::GetSecurity() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the security level of a player from the WhoListPlayerInfo object.
  description: The GetSecurity method returns the account security type associated
    with a player in the who list. This value indicates the player's access level
    within the game's account system, determining what administrative or game functionalities
    they can access. The returned AccountTypes enum typically represents different
    levels such as Player, Moderator, Gamemaster, Admin, or higher privileges depending
    on the server configuration. This method is commonly used in player listing and
    filtering systems where security levels are needed for display or permission checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an AccountTypes enumeration value representing the player's security
    level. Possible values include ACCOUNT_TYPE_PLAYER, ACCOUNT_TYPE_MODERATOR, ACCOUNT_TYPE_GAMEMASTER,
    ACCOUNT_TYPE_ADMINISTRATOR, etc., depending on the server's account privilege
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo ...\nAccountTypes\
      \ securityLevel = playerInfo.GetSecurity();\nif (securityLevel >= ACCOUNT_TYPE_GAMEMASTER)\n\
      {\n    // Player has GM privileges\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the WhoList system to display
    player information. The security level returned corresponds directly to the account's
    privilege level in the database and should not be modified directly through this
    interface.
