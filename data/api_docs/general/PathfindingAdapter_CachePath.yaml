  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: CachePath
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::CachePath(Player * bot, const int & destination,
    const MovementPath & path)
documentation:
  brief: Caches a movement path for a bot player to a specified destination.
  description: The CachePath method stores a pre-calculated movement path for a given
    player bot to reach a specific destination. This functionality is typically used
    in AI pathfinding systems to optimize performance by avoiding repeated path calculations.
    The method accepts a Player object representing the bot, an integer identifier
    for the destination, and a MovementPath object containing the actual path data.
    It integrates with TrinityCore's navigation mesh system to store paths that can
    be retrieved later during bot movement execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the path
      is being cached. Must not be null.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination point for the cached
      path. This typically corresponds to a waypoint or node ID in the navigation
      mesh.
  - name: path
    description: MovementPath object containing the pre-calculated path data from
      the bot's current position to the destination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Caching Example
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      int destId = 12345;

      MovementPath path;

      // Assume path is populated with valid movement data

      PathfindingAdapter::CachePath(bot, destId, path);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after a path has been calculated using the
    Pathfinding system. The cached paths are usually stored in an internal lookup
    table or map structure for quick retrieval during bot movement updates. It's important
    to ensure that the destination ID uniquely identifies the target location to avoid
    conflicts.
