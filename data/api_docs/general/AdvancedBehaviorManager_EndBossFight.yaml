  method: EndBossFight
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::EndBossFight(bool victory)
documentation:
  brief: Concludes a boss fight, handling victory or defeat conditions and cleanup.
  description: The EndBossFight method is responsible for finalizing a boss encounter
    within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. It takes a boolean parameter indicating whether
    the player party has won the fight (true) or lost (false). This method typically
    handles post-fight logic such as rewarding players, updating quest progress, removing
    boss-specific NPCs, and triggering any associated events or achievements. The
    method is designed to be called at the end of a boss encounter when the fight
    has concluded, ensuring proper cleanup and state management for both victory and
    defeat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: victory
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the boss fight was won (true) or lost
      (false). This determines the post-fight actions taken by the behavior manager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Fight End
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = ...;

      behaviorMgr->EndBossFight(true); // Player defeated the boss'
    language: cpp
  - title: Defeat Scenario
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = ...;

      behaviorMgr->EndBossFight(false); // Player failed the boss fight'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a boss fight has concluded. It is
    typically invoked by the AI system or combat handler when a boss is defeated or
    when the player party retreats from combat. The method may trigger additional
    events or callbacks depending on the specific implementation and encounter design.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active boss fight context can lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect state management. Ensure that all necessary cleanup
    and reward logic has been properly initialized before calling this method.
