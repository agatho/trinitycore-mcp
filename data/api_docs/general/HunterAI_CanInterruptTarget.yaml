  class: HunterAI
  method: CanInterruptTarget
  signature: bool HunterAI::CanInterruptTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter can interrupt the current target's spell casting.
  description: The CanInterruptTarget method evaluates if the hunter AI is capable
    of interrupting an ongoing spell cast by the current target. This functionality
    is crucial for Hunter class gameplay mechanics, particularly when using abilities
    like Improved Arcane Shot or other interruption-based talents. The method checks
    various conditions such as target validity, spell casting state, and the hunter's
    own capabilities to determine if an interruption is possible. It typically returns
    true only when the target is actively casting a spell that can be interrupted
    by the hunter's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object being evaluated for potential spell
      interruption. This parameter is actually not used in the method signature as
      indicated, but represents the current target context within the AI system.
  returns: Returns true if the hunter can interrupt the target's current spell cast;
    otherwise returns false. The method will return false if the target is not casting
    a spell that can be interrupted, or if the hunter does not have the capability
    to perform such an interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (hunterAI->CanInterruptTarget(nullptr)) {\n    // Attempt to interrupt\
      \ target's spell\n    hunterAI->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Checks
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (CanInterruptTarget(nullptr) && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n        // Perform interruption logic\n        DoInterruptSpell();\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Hunter AI system and relies on internal state
    tracking of both the hunter and target units. It may be called frequently during
    combat updates, so performance considerations should be taken into account when
    implementing custom logic. The method does not actually use the parameter in its
    implementation based on typical TrinityCore patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the target is valid before calling this method to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior. This method should only be called when the hunter
    AI has an active target and is in combat state.
