  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void QuestEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the provided processing time for quest events.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related metrics within the QuestEventBus system. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the processing time of a quest event, which is used to
    track performance statistics such as average processing times, throughput, and
    potential bottlenecks in quest handling logic. This method is typically invoked
    after processing a quest event to maintain accurate performance data for monitoring
    and optimization purposes. The metrics collected can be used by system administrators
    or developers to identify performance issues, optimize quest-related code, or
    ensure that quest events are processed within acceptable time limits.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time taken to process a quest event, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents the duration from when the event begins processing until
      it completes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateMetrics
    code: 'QuestEventBus& bus = QuestEventBus::Instance();

      std::chrono::microseconds time(1500);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(time);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating metrics after quest event processing
    code: "void HandleQuestEvent(Quest* quest)\n{\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Process quest logic here\n    ProcessQuest(quest);\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start);\n    QuestEventBus::Instance().UpdateMetrics(duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the quest event processing pipeline.
    It may aggregate metrics over time and could be used in conjunction with other
    monitoring systems to provide insights into quest performance. The method should
    be thread-safe if multiple threads are involved in quest processing, as it's expected
    to update shared metrics data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the processingTime parameter is always a positive value; negative
    values may lead to incorrect metric calculations or unexpected behavior. This
    method should not be called with excessively large values that could skew average
    calculations or cause overflow issues in internal tracking mechanisms.
