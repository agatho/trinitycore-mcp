  method: UpdateZone
  signature: void Player::UpdateZone(uint32 newZone, uint32 newArea)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's zone and area information, triggering relevant game
    state changes.
  description: The UpdateZone method is responsible for updating a player's current
    zone and area identifiers within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    invoked when a player moves from one geographical region to another in the game
    world. It handles internal state updates such as zone-based quest tracking, area-trigger
    activations, and client-side zone information synchronization. The method ensures
    that all zone-related systems are aware of the player's new location, which may
    affect gameplay mechanics like zone-specific buffs, debuffs, or restrictions.
    This is an internal method used primarily by the core game engine during movement
    processing.
  parameters:
  - name: newZone
    description: The new zone identifier that the player has entered. This value corresponds
      to the ZoneId from the game's zone database and determines zone-specific gameplay
      mechanics.
  - name: newArea
    description: The new area identifier that the player has entered. This value corresponds
      to the AreaId from the game's area database and is used for more granular location-based
      systems such as area triggers, faction rep changes, or localized events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Player Zone During Movement
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player, uint32 newZoneId, uint32 newAreaId)\n\
      {\n    // Called internally by movement system when player crosses zone boundary\n\
      \    player->UpdateZone(newZoneId, newAreaId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Zone Change with Quest State Update
    code: "void OnPlayerZoneChange(Player* player, uint32 oldZone, uint32 newZone)\n\
      {\n    // Update zone information\n    player->UpdateZone(newZone, player->GetAreaId());\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger zone-specific quest updates\n    player->UpdateQuestZoneOrArea(newZone);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    and should not be invoked directly by most game logic. The implementation handles
    synchronization with the client's zone information and may trigger zone-based
    events or quest updates. It does not perform any validation of the zone/area IDs
    - it assumes valid values are passed.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of core movement handling can
    cause inconsistent game state. Zone and area identifiers must be valid database
    entries, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. This method should only be called
    when a player has actually moved to a new zone/area, not for simulation purposes.
