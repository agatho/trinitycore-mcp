documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of flight paths known by the player
  description: The GetKnownFlightPaths method returns the total number of flight paths
    that have been discovered and are known to the player character. This value represents
    how many destinations the player can currently fly to using their flight master.
    The method does not return the actual flight path data itself, but rather provides
    a count which is useful for determining the player's current flight path knowledge
    state. In World of Warcraft context, this typically corresponds to the number
    of cities or locations that have been visited and unlocked as flight destinations
    through exploration or quest completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total count of known flight paths for
    the player. Returns 0 if no flight paths are known, or a positive integer indicating
    the number of discovered flight destinations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int knownPaths = flightMasterManager.GetKnownFlightPaths();\nif (knownPaths\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player knows \" << knownPaths << \" flight paths.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Flight Path Progress
    code: "int totalKnown = player->GetFlightMasterManager()->GetKnownFlightPaths();\n\
      if (totalKnown >= 10)\n{\n    // Player has discovered enough flight paths for\
      \ a specific achievement\n    player->CompleteAchievement(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flight master functionality
    to determine the player's progress in discovering flight destinations. The returned
    count may change dynamically as players explore new areas or complete quests that
    unlock additional flight paths.
