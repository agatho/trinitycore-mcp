documentation:
  brief: Adds aura vision to a player, allowing them to see invisible auras.
  description: This method enables a player to perceive invisible auras and effects
    that would normally be hidden from view. It typically modifies the player's field
    byte flags to include visibility of aura effects, allowing for enhanced gameplay
    experience in scenarios involving stealth or invisibility mechanics. The method
    is part of the player's visual perception system and affects how the player sees
    other players' aura effects.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->AddAuraVision(PlayerFieldByte2Flags::FLAG_AURA_VISIBILITY);

      // Player now sees invisible auras'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely modifies the player's
    field byte flags to include visibility of aura effects. Performance considerations
    may arise from frequent updates to visual perception flags, especially in high-traffic
    scenarios.
  warnings: This method should not be used without understanding of the underlying
    game mechanics. Incorrect usage can lead to visual glitches or inappropriate visibility
    of invisible auras. Avoid using this method in rapid succession without proper
    checks.
