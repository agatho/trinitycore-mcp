  class: SupportMgr
  method: GenerateComplaintId
  signature: int SupportMgr::GenerateComplaintId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for support complaints within the TrinityCore
    system.
  description: The GenerateComplaintId method is responsible for creating and returning
    a unique integer identifier that represents a support complaint in the World of
    Warcraft server environment. This ID is used internally by the SupportMgr class
    to track, manage, and reference specific user-reported issues or concerns. The
    generated ID ensures no two complaints will have the same identifier, maintaining
    data integrity within the support system. This method typically increments an
    internal counter or utilizes a database-generated sequence to ensure uniqueness
    across all complaint records.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier for a newly created
    support complaint. The returned ID is guaranteed to be unique within the current
    server session and database context, allowing for reliable tracking and referencing
    of specific complaints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SupportMgr* mgr = sWorld->GetSupportMgr();

      int complaintId = mgr->GenerateComplaintId();

      printf("New complaint ID: %d\n", complaintId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a new support ticket or complaint is
    submitted by a player. It's important to note that the generated IDs are not necessarily
    sequential but are guaranteed unique. The implementation may rely on database
    auto-increment fields or internal counters depending on the server configuration.
