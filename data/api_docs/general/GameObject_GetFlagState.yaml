  method: GetFlagState
  signature: FlagState GameObject::GetFlagState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current flag state of the game object.
  description: This method returns the flag state of a GameObject, which represents
    the current state of various flags associated with the object. The flag state
    typically indicates whether the object is active, interacted with, or in a specific
    state within the game world. This method is commonly used to determine the behavior
    and status of game objects during interaction events, particularly for objects
    that may have multiple states such as doors, buttons, or other interactive elements.
    Understanding this flag state is crucial for proper game mechanics implementation
    and can affect how players interact with these objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the current FlagState of the GameObject, which
    typically indicates whether the object is in an active state, has been interacted
    with, or is in a specific state within the game world. The exact meaning depends
    on the context and implementation but generally reflects the object's current
    status in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "FlagState state = gameObject->GetFlagState();\nif (state == FLAG_STATE_ACTIVE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle active state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for execution. Performance impact is minimal as it simply retrieves a stored flag
    value without complex operations. Developers should be aware that the flag state
    may vary depending on the specific GameObject type and implementation.
  warnings: No significant warnings. However, developers should ensure they understand
    the specific flag states used by different GameObject types, as misinterpretation
    of flag states can lead to incorrect behavior in game interactions.
