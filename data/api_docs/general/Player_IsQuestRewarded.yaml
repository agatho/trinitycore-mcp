documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has completed a specific quest.
  description: This method checks if a player has already completed a given quest,
    returning true if the quest is marked as rewarded and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used in quest-related logic to verify completion status before allowing further
    interaction or reward processing. The method operates on the player's quest log
    data and considers both active and completed quests in its evaluation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has been completed and rewarded, false otherwise.
    The method may return false for quests that are not yet completed or have not
    been marked as rewarded by the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Check
    code: "if (player->IsQuestRewarded(12345))\n{\n    // Quest already completed\n\
      \    // Proceed with reward logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest not yet completed\n\
      \    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest tracking mechanisms and may not reflect
    real-time updates if the player's quest log changes during runtime. It is recommended
    to use this method in conjunction with other quest-related methods for comprehensive
    quest status checking.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with other quest-related
    functions, as inconsistent state can occur if quest completion status changes
    during runtime. Also note that this method does not verify whether the quest was
    actually rewarded or simply marked as completed.
