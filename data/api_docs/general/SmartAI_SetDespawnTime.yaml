  class: SmartAI
  method: SetDespawnTime
  signature: void SmartAI::SetDespawnTime(uint32 t)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the despawn time for the SmartAI-controlled creature or game object.
  description: The SetDespawnTime method configures the amount of time (in milliseconds)
    after which the AI-controlled creature or game object will automatically despawn
    from the world. This is commonly used in quest events, scripted encounters, or
    temporary spawns where an NPC or object should not persist indefinitely. The timer
    begins immediately upon calling this function, and if set to zero, the despawn
    behavior is typically disabled unless overridden by other logic. This method is
    part of the SmartAI system which provides advanced AI scripting capabilities for
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the creature or game object
      should despawn. A value of 0 disables automatic despawning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Set Despawn Time to 30 Seconds
    code: "void OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Set the creature to despawn after 30 seconds\n\
      \    me->GetAI()->SetDespawnTime(30000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Automatic Despawn
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Disable\
      \ despawn for this NPC\n    me->GetAI()->SetDespawnTime(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the automatic despawn behavior; manual removal via
    RemoveFromWorld() or similar functions will still work regardless of the despawn
    time setting. The actual despawn timing may be influenced by server tick rates
    and other AI-related delays.
  warnings: Setting a very short despawn time (e.g., less than 100ms) might cause
    unexpected behavior if the AI logic does not account for rapid removal. Ensure
    that any dependent systems are aware of potential early despawns.
