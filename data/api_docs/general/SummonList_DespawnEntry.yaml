  class: SummonList
  method: DespawnEntry
  signature: void SummonList::DespawnEntry(int entry)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns all summons of a specified entry type from the SummonList.
  description: The DespawnEntry method removes all currently active summons that match
    the given entry ID from the SummonList. This function is typically used in AI
    scripts or creature behaviors to clean up summoned creatures when they are no
    longer needed. The method iterates through the list of summons and removes those
    with the matching entry ID, ensuring that the summoned creatures are properly
    destroyed and removed from the world. This operation affects only the specific
    entry type specified and does not impact other summons in the list.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID of the summons to be despawned. This corresponds
      to the creature_template.entry field in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Despawn all summoned wolves\n\
      \    m_summonList.DespawnEntry(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Despawning
    code: "void BossAI::JustDied(Unit* killer)\n{\n    // Despawn all summoned adds\
      \ when boss dies\n    if (m_summonList.HasAnySummons())\n    {\n        m_summonList.DespawnEntry(98765);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal summon list and does not directly interact
    with the database. It's important to note that the summons are destroyed immediately
    upon calling this method, which may cause issues if other systems depend on the
    existence of these creatures during the same execution cycle.
  warnings: Calling DespawnEntry on a SummonList that is currently being iterated
    over can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that no active iteration
    is occurring when calling this method.
