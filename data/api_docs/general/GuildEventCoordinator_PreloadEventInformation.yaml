  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: PreloadEventInformation
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::PreloadEventInformation(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and caches event data for a specified guild event ID.
  description: The PreloadEventInformation method retrieves and caches all relevant
    information for a given guild event, including event details, participant lists,
    and associated timestamps. This method is typically called before processing or
    displaying guild events to ensure all necessary data is available in memory, reducing
    database queries during active event handling. The preloading mechanism helps
    optimize performance by minimizing latency when accessing event-related data during
    gameplay operations such as event notifications, participation tracking, or reward
    distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to preload information for.
      This value corresponds to the ID field in the guild_event table within the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Preload Event Information for a Specific Guild Event
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.PreloadEventInformation(12345); // Preloads information for guild
      event with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called asynchronously or during server initialization
    phases to avoid blocking gameplay threads. It may internally utilize caching mechanisms
    to store event data in memory, which can be accessed quickly by other methods
    within the GuildEventCoordinator class.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId (e.g., zero or non-existent
    event ID) may result in undefined behavior or failed data retrieval. Ensure that
    the eventId parameter corresponds to a valid guild event before invoking this
    method.
