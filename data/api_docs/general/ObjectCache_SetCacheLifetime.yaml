  class: ObjectCache
  method: SetCacheLifetime
  signature: void ObjectCache::SetCacheLifetime(uint32 lifetimeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cache lifetime for objects in the ObjectCache to specify how long
    cached entries remain valid before expiration.
  description: The SetCacheLifetime method configures the maximum time-to-live (TTL)
    for cached objects within the ObjectCache. This determines how long entries will
    remain in the cache before being automatically removed. The lifetime is specified
    in milliseconds and affects all subsequent cache operations. This mechanism helps
    manage memory usage by preventing stale data from persisting indefinitely, which
    is particularly important in a game environment like World of Warcraft where object
    states change frequently. The method does not validate the input value, so developers
    should ensure that the provided lifetime is appropriate for their use case.
  parameters:
  - name: lifetimeMs
    description: The cache lifetime in milliseconds. Specifies how long cached objects
      remain valid before automatic expiration. Must be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Default Cache Lifetime
    code: ObjectCache::Instance()->SetCacheLifetime(30000); // Set cache to expire
      after 30 seconds
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Long-Term Caching
    code: ObjectCache::Instance()->SetCacheLifetime(3600000); // Set cache to expire
      after 1 hour (3600 seconds)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global cache behavior and applies to all objects
    stored in the ObjectCache. The implementation likely uses a time-based expiration
    mechanism, possibly with background cleanup threads or lazy expiration during
    access. Performance considerations include potential overhead from frequent cache
    invalidation if very short lifetimes are used.
  warnings: Setting extremely short cache lifetimes may result in excessive cache
    misses and reduced performance. Setting very long lifetimes can lead to memory
    bloat and stale data usage, especially for frequently changing game objects like
    players or units.
