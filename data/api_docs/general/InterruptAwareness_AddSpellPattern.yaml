  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: AddSpellPattern
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::AddSpellPattern(uint32 npcId, const int & spellSequence)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a spell sequence pattern for a specific NPC to enable interrupt
    awareness behavior.
  description: The AddSpellPattern method associates a spell sequence with a specified
    NPC ID, allowing the game's AI system to recognize and respond to particular spell
    casting patterns. This functionality is typically used in custom AI implementations
    or scripted encounters where specific sequences of spells need to be monitored
    for interruptible states or special behaviors. The method stores the pattern internally
    for later retrieval during combat events. It does not validate the existence of
    the NPC ID or the spell sequence, so it's important that these values are correctly
    set before calling this method.
  parameters:
  - name: npcId
    description: The unique identifier of the NPC for which the spell pattern is being
      registered. This should correspond to a valid creature entry in the database.
  - name: spellSequence
    description: A reference to an integer representing the spell sequence to be associated
      with the NPC. The value typically represents a predefined sequence or ID that
      identifies a specific casting pattern.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.AddSpellPattern(12345, 1001); // Register spell sequence 1001 for
      NPC with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Patterns Registration
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.AddSpellPattern(12345, 1001);

      awareness.AddSpellPattern(12346, 1002);

      awareness.AddSpellPattern(12347, 1003); // Register multiple spell sequences
      for different NPCs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the InterruptAwareness system which is designed to
    enhance AI behavior in complex encounters. The internal storage mechanism may
    use hash maps or similar structures for efficient lookups during combat events.
    Ensure that spell sequences are properly defined and consistent with existing
    game mechanics to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid NPC IDs or undefined spell sequences
    may lead to unpredictable results during AI processing. It is recommended to validate
    inputs before calling this method, especially in dynamic environments where NPCs
    or spell definitions might change at runtime.
