  method: GetAuction
  signature: AuctionPosting * AuctionHouseObject::GetAuction(uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an auction posting from the auction house by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetAuction method fetches a specific auction posting from the auction
    house database using its unique auction ID. This method is typically used when
    processing auction-related actions such as retrieving auction details, verifying
    auction existence, or modifying existing auctions. The returned pointer provides
    direct access to the auction's data structure, allowing for inspection and modification
    of auction properties. The method performs a lookup in the internal auction cache
    or database, depending on implementation details. It is important to note that
    the returned pointer may be null if no auction exists with the specified ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an AuctionPosting object representing the auction with the
    specified ID, or nullptr if no such auction exists in the auction house.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Auction
    code: "AuctionPosting* auction = auctionHouse->GetAuction(12345);\nif (auction\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process valid auction\n    sLog->outString(\"Found\
      \ auction: %u\", auction->GetAuctionId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle missing\
      \ auction\n    sLog->outString(\"No auction found with ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in auction house event handlers and command
    implementations. The returned AuctionPosting pointer should be used carefully
    as it points to internal data structures that may be modified by other systems.
    Consider thread safety implications when accessing auctions from concurrent contexts.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the returned
    pointer. Accessing invalid auction IDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    if not properly validated.
