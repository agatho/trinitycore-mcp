  method: LoadZonesFromConfig
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::LoadZonesFromConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Loads zone data from the configuration file for bot world positioning calculations.
  description: The LoadZonesFromConfig method initializes and populates internal zone-related
    data structures by reading configuration settings. This method is typically invoked
    during system initialization or when configuration changes occur, ensuring that
    bot positioning logic has access to up-to-date zone boundaries, restrictions,
    and other relevant geographic data. The method processes configuration entries
    related to zones, such as area triggers, restricted regions, and navigation constraints,
    which are essential for determining valid positions for bots within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.LoadZonesFromConfig();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the configuration system is fully initialized
    but before any bot positioning operations begin. It may trigger internal data
    validation and could potentially block briefly while reading configuration files.
