  brief: Increments the count of the level bracket by one.
  description: The IncrementCount method increases the internal counter associated
    with a specific level bracket. This method is typically used in game systems that
    track player activity or progression within defined level ranges. The operation
    is performed in-place and does not return any value. It is marked as const, indicating
    that it does not modify the object's state beyond the internal counter.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      bracket.IncrementCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages player level-based
    statistics or achievements. Since it's marked as const, it should not have side
    effects beyond modifying internal counters.
