  method: OptimizeThreatDistribution
  signature: void BotThreatManager::OptimizeThreatDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Redistributes threat among bot group members to optimize combat engagement
    and prevent aggro stacking.
  description: The OptimizeThreatDistribution method adjusts the threat levels of
    all bots within a group to ensure balanced combat participation. This function
    is typically invoked during combat scenarios to prevent any single bot from accumulating
    excessive threat, which could lead to undesirable aggro distribution. It analyzes
    current threat values and redistributes them according to predefined rules that
    consider factors such as bot role, health status, and proximity to the target.
    The method ensures that bots maintain appropriate threat levels to support effective
    group combat performance while avoiding situations where one bot monopolizes enemy
    attention.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        botThreatManager->OptimizeThreatDistribution();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in bot AI systems within TrinityCore's framework.
    It should be called regularly during combat to maintain optimal threat distribution.
    The implementation likely involves internal calculations based on bot attributes
    and group dynamics, but the exact algorithm details are not publicly exposed.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat scenarios may produce unexpected
    results or have no effect. It is designed specifically for active combat situations
    where threat management is critical for group performance.
