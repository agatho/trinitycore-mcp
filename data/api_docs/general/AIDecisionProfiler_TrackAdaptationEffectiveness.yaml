  method: TrackAdaptationEffectiveness
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::TrackAdaptationEffectiveness()
documentation:
  brief: Records and tracks the effectiveness of AI adaptation decisions made during
    combat.
  description: The TrackAdaptationEffectiveness method is used to monitor how well
    the AI system adapts its decision-making strategies in response to changing combat
    conditions. This method likely collects data on the outcomes of various adaptive
    behaviors, such as switching tactics, adjusting target selection, or modifying
    spell usage patterns. It serves as a diagnostic tool for evaluating AI performance
    and can be used to improve future decision-making algorithms by analyzing which
    adaptations led to successful outcomes. The method is typically invoked during
    active combat scenarios where AI-controlled entities are making real-time tactical
    decisions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void AICombatHandler::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_decisionProfiler->TrackAdaptationEffectiveness();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat actions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during active combat to gather
    performance metrics. It may store data in internal buffers or log files for later
    analysis. The implementation might involve comparing expected vs actual outcomes
    of adaptive decisions to calculate effectiveness scores.
  warnings: The method should only be called during active combat scenarios where
    AI decisions are being made. Calling it outside of combat contexts may result
    in inaccurate or meaningless data collection.
