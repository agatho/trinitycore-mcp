  class: BotLifecycle
  method: GetState
  signature: BotLifecycleState BotLifecycle::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current lifecycle state of the bot.
  description: The GetState method returns the current BotLifecycleState enum value
    that represents the operational status or phase of the bot within the TrinityCore
    system. This state indicates what stage the bot is currently in, such as idle,
    active, paused, or terminated. The returned state can be used by other systems
    to determine how to interact with the bot, whether to send commands, update its
    behavior, or handle cleanup operations. This method is typically called during
    bot management routines to assess the bot's current condition and make decisions
    based on that information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotLifecycleState enum value indicating the current operational state
    of the bot. Possible values may include but are not limited to IDLE, ACTIVE, PAUSED,
    TERMINATED, or ERROR depending on the implementation details of the TrinityCore
    bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Check Bot State Before Execution
    code: "BotLifecycle* bot = GetBotById(12345);\nif (bot->GetState() == BotLifecycleState::ACTIVE)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot command execution\n    bot->ExecuteCommand(\"move\
      \ forward\");\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive or invalid state\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot is not in active state.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the
    bot. It simply reads and returns the current lifecycle state, making it safe to
    call from multiple threads concurrently without requiring synchronization.
