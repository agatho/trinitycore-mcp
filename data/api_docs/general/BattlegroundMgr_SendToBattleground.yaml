api:
  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: SendToBattleground
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::SendToBattleground(Player * player, const Battleground
    * battleground)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a player to a specified battleground instance.
  description: The SendToBattleground method is responsible for teleporting a player
    to a specific battleground instance. This method handles the necessary preparations
    and logistics required to move a player into a battleground, including updating
    player state, managing group assignments, and ensuring proper synchronization
    with the battleground system. It is typically invoked during battleground queue
    processing when players are matched and ready to enter combat. The method ensures
    that the player's character data is correctly transferred to the battleground
    environment while maintaining game balance and preventing exploits such as premature
    entry or incorrect team assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be sent to the battleground.
      Must be a valid player instance with proper authentication and state.
  - name: battleground
    description: Pointer to the Battleground object representing the target battleground
      instance. Must be a valid battleground that is currently active or in preparation
      state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Battleground* bg = ...; // Get battleground reference

      sBattlegroundMgr->SendToBattleground(player, bg);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Queue Processing
    code: "void HandleBattlegroundQueue(Player* player, BattlegroundTypeId bgType)\n\
      {\n    Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(bgType);\n\
      \    if (bg && player)\n    {\n        sBattlegroundMgr->SendToBattleground(player,\
      \ bg);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and battleground are valid and properly
    initialized. It does not perform validation checks on these parameters internally.
    The actual teleportation process involves multiple subsystems including the player's
    movement handler, battleground instance management, and group synchronization
    logic.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in undefined
    behavior or client-side desynchronization. Ensure that the player is not already
    in a battleground before calling this method. Also, be aware that this method
    does not handle queue removal or cleanup - those responsibilities lie with other
    parts of the battleground system.
