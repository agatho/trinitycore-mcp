documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the event script set identifier associated with the game object
    template.
  description: The GetEventScriptSet method returns an integer value representing
    the event script set assigned to this game object template. In TrinityCore, event
    scripts are used to define custom behaviors for game objects during specific events
    or interactions. This identifier links the game object to a predefined set of
    scripted actions that can be triggered by various in-game conditions such as player
    interaction, area triggers, or time-based events. The method provides access to
    the script configuration without requiring direct manipulation of internal data
    structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the event script set identifier. A value of 0 typically
    indicates no event script is associated with the game object template, while positive
    integers correspond to specific script sets defined in the database or script
    files.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject has an Event Script Set
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate)\n{\n    int scriptSetId = goTemplate->GetEventScriptSet();\n\
      \    if (scriptSetId > 0)\n    {\n        // GameObject has an associated event\
      \ script set\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"sql.sql\", \"GameObject %u has event script\
      \ set ID: %i\", 12345, scriptSetId);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No\
      \ event script set assigned\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"sql.sql\", \"GameObject %u\
      \ has no event script set\", 12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with the GameObject's OnUse or
    OnTrigger handlers to determine which scripted events should be executed. The
    returned value directly maps to entries in the `gameobject_template` table's `event_script_id`
    column, which is used by the core's event system to dispatch appropriate scripts.
  warnings: Be aware that a return value of 0 does not necessarily indicate an error
    condition; it simply means no event script set is assigned. Always validate against
    zero before assuming there is no script behavior associated with the object.
