  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: GetProfessionItemsInInventory
  signature: int ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetProfessionItemsInInventory(int * player,
    bool materialsOnly) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of profession items in a player's inventory, optionally
    filtering for materials only.
  description: The GetProfessionItemsInInventory method enumerates all items associated
    with a player's professions that are currently in their inventory. It can optionally
    filter the results to include only material items required for crafting. This
    method is typically used within the context of auction house functionality and
    profession management systems. The method requires a valid player reference and
    performs internal checks to ensure proper data access. The returned value represents
    the total number of matching items found in the inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must be a valid pointer to a player GUID.
  - name: materialsOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to filter results to include only
      profession materials. When true, only items classified as crafting materials
      are counted; when false, all profession-related items are included.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of profession items found in
    the player's inventory that match the specified criteria. Returns zero if no matching
    items are found or if the player reference is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerGuid = 12345;

      int itemCount = bridge.GetProfessionItemsInInventory(&playerGuid, false);

      printf("Total profession items: %d\n", itemCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Material-Only Filtering
    code: 'int playerGuid = 12345;

      int materialCount = bridge.GetProfessionItemsInInventory(&playerGuid, true);

      printf("Profession materials: %d\n", materialCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal inventory traversal and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. It assumes the player GUID is valid and accessible
    within the current session context. The implementation relies on TrinityCore's
    internal profession and item database structures.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player reference is valid before calling
    this method. This method should not be called from within critical sections where
    inventory modifications are occurring.
