  class: ScopedProfiler
  method: MarkAsHotspot
  signature: void ScopedProfiler::MarkAsHotspot(double impact)
documentation:
  brief: Marks the current profiler scope as a hotspot with the specified impact value.
  description: The MarkAsHotspot method is used to designate the current profiling
    scope as a performance hotspot, assigning it an impact score that indicates how
    significant the performance issue is within the context of the profiler's analysis.
    This method typically integrates with TrinityCore's profiling system to help developers
    identify and prioritize performance bottlenecks in game code. The impact parameter
    allows for quantifying the severity of the hotspot, which can be used for reporting
    or sorting purposes. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    profiler state to reflect this hotspot designation.
  parameters:
  - name: impact
    description: A double value representing the impact level of the hotspot. Higher
      values indicate more severe performance issues. The exact scale and interpretation
      depend on the profiler's implementation, but typically ranges from 0.0 (no impact)
      to 1.0 (maximum impact).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Marking
    code: 'ScopedProfiler profiler("UpdatePlayer");

      // ... some code ...

      profiler.MarkAsHotspot(0.75); // Mark as significant hotspot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Hotspot Marking
    code: "ScopedProfiler profiler(\"ProcessAI\");\nif (aiUpdateTime > 100) {\n  \
      \  profiler.MarkAsHotspot(aiUpdateTime / 100.0); // Scale impact based on delay\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ScopedProfiler's automatic
    timing features to provide detailed performance analysis. The impact value should
    be carefully chosen to reflect actual performance degradation rather than arbitrary
    thresholds. Profiler hotspots are usually reported during profiling sessions or
    when the profiler is explicitly flushed.
  warnings: Using this method without proper profiling context may result in misleading
    hotspot reports. Ensure that the impact value accurately reflects real-world performance
    degradation, as incorrect values can mislead optimization efforts. This method
    should not be called outside of a valid ScopedProfiler scope.
