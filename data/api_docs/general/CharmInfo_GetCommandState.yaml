documentation:
  brief: Returns the current command state of the charm
  description: The GetCommandState method retrieves the current command state of a
    charm, which indicates how the creature should respond to player commands. This
    is used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to determine whether the charm
    is in a passive, defensive, or aggressive state. The returned CommandStates enum
    value helps control the behavior of summoned creatures and pets in relation to
    their master's commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CommandStates enum value representing the current command state of the
    charm. Possible values include COMMAND_STAY, COMMAND_FOLLOW, COMMAND_ATTACK, and
    others depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check current command state of a charm
    code: "if (charmInfo->GetCommandState() == COMMAND_STAY)\n{\n    // Charm is in\
      \ stay mode\n    // Do not move or attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used by the AI system to make decisions about creature
    behavior. The command state affects how the charm responds to various events and
    commands from its master.
