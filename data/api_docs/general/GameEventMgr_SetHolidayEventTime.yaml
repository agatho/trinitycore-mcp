  class: GameEventMgr
  method: SetHolidayEventTime
  signature: void GameEventMgr::SetHolidayEventTime(GameEventData & event)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the start and end times for a specified holiday event within the
    game event manager.
  description: The SetHolidayEventTime method is responsible for setting or updating
    the active time period for a given holiday event. This method ensures that the
    event's start and end times are correctly configured in the GameEventMgr system,
    which controls when holiday events become active or inactive within the game world.
    It typically gets invoked during server initialization or when event data is modified
    to synchronize the internal timing state with the provided event data. The method
    operates on a reference to a GameEventData structure, updating its time-related
    fields based on the current system time or predefined values.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A reference to a GameEventData object containing the holiday event
      information including start and end times that will be used to update the internal
      event state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Holiday Event Times
    code: 'GameEventData eventData;

      // Assume eventData is populated with valid holiday data

      GameEventMgr::instance()->SetHolidayEventTime(eventData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the GameEventData structure has been properly
    initialized and populated with correct time values. It does not validate the input
    times, so it's important that the caller ensures valid date/time ranges before
    invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GameEventData
    structure may lead to incorrect event timing behavior or runtime errors. Ensure
    all time fields in the event data are correctly set before passing it to this
    function.
