  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadTempSummons()
documentation:
  brief: Loads temporary summons from the database into memory for active use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadTempSummons method initializes and loads all temporary summons
    stored in the database into the game world's object manager. These summons are
    typically creatures or game objects that are meant to appear temporarily under
    specific conditions, such as quest-related spawns or event-based appearances.
    This method is usually invoked during server startup or when reloading game data
    to ensure that all temporary summon entries are properly registered and available
    for spawning. It reads summon templates from the database and prepares them for
    instantiation by the world system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadTempSummons();\n    // Other\
      \ loading logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server startup and should not
    be invoked repeatedly. It assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that summon-related tables contain valid data. The loaded summons are managed
    by the ObjectMgr and will be automatically cleaned up when no longer needed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries or
    memory leaks if not handled carefully. Ensure that database integrity is maintained
    for summon templates to prevent runtime errors during creature/object spawning.
