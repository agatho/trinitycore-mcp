  class: RogueAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void RogueAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified resource for a rogue AI action based on the given
    spell ID.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for managing the consumption
    of resources such as energy, combo points, or other rogue-specific mechanics when
    executing abilities. This method ensures that the rogue AI respects game rules
    and resource limitations when performing actions. It typically checks if sufficient
    resources are available before allowing an action to proceed, and deducts the
    required amount from the rogue's current resource pool. The method may also trigger
    additional logic related to resource management or cooldowns depending on the
    spell being used.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability that requires resource
      consumption. This ID determines which resources are consumed and how much is
      deducted from the rogue's current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void RogueAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    // Example implementation\n\
      \    if (spellId == 1752) // Sinister Strike\n    {\n        // Consume 1 combo\
      \ point\n        if (me->GetComboPoints() > 0)\n            me->ModifyComboPoints(-1);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a rogue
    attempts to cast a spell or use an ability. It's important to ensure that resource
    checks are performed before calling this method to avoid invalid state changes.
  warnings: Improper handling of resource consumption can lead to incorrect gameplay
    behavior, such as allowing abilities to be used without proper resources or incorrectly
    deducting resources multiple times.
