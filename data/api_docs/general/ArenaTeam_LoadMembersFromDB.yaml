  signature: bool ArenaTeam::LoadMembersFromDB(int arenaTeamMembersResult)
documentation:
  brief: Loads arena team member data from the database into the arena team object
  description: The LoadMembersFromDB method retrieves all member records associated
    with the current arena team from the database and populates the internal member
    list. This method is typically called during arena team initialization or when
    refreshing team data. It performs a database query to fetch member information
    including player GUIDs, roles, and statistics. The method ensures that all members
    are properly loaded into memory for subsequent operations like matchmaking, ranking
    updates, or roster display. This is an essential part of the arena team management
    system in TrinityCore's PvP framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the member data was successfully loaded from the database,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a database error
    or that no members exist for this arena team.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = new ArenaTeam();\nif (team->LoadMembersFromDB(0)) {\n\
      \    // Members successfully loaded\n    // Proceed with team operations\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle loading failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load\
      \ arena team members for team ID %u\", team->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Arena Team Creation
    code: "uint32 arenaTeamId = 12345;\nArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(arenaTeamId);\n\
      if (team && !team->IsMemberLoaded()) {\n    if (team->LoadMembersFromDB(0))\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Arena team %u members loaded successfully\",\
      \ arenaTeamId);\n        // Team is now ready for use\n    } else {\n      \
      \  sLog->outError(\"Failed to load members for arena team %u\", arenaTeamId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query and should be called sparingly to avoid
    performance degradation. The method assumes that the arena team ID is already
    set in the object. It's typically used internally by the ArenaTeamManager during
    team initialization or refresh operations.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized arena team object may result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the arena team has been properly initialized with
    a valid team ID before calling this method. The method does not validate member
    data after loading - it simply retrieves it from the database.
