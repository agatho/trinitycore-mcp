  method: ValidateVendorData
  signature: void VendorInteraction::ValidateVendorData()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the vendor data associated with a VendorInteraction instance to
    ensure it meets required criteria for proper functionality.
  description: 'The ValidateVendorData method performs internal checks on the vendor
    data within a VendorInteraction object to confirm that all necessary fields and
    values are correctly set. This validation ensures that the vendor interaction
    can proceed without errors, such as missing item entries, invalid prices, or incorrect
    NPC references. The method typically runs before processing vendor transactions
    or displaying vendor interfaces to players. It may throw exceptions or log warnings
    if data inconsistencies are detected. Precondition: The VendorInteraction object
    must be initialized with valid data. Postcondition: The vendor data is confirmed
    to be in a valid state for further operations.'

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during vendor interaction setup
    or before critical operations like item selling/buying. It's important to note
    that this method does not modify any data but only verifies its integrity.
