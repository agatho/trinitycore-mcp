    float range, SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType, SpellTargetCheckTypes selectionType,
    const int * condList)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for nearby targets within a specified range and type for spell effects.
  description: This method finds nearby target objects based on the provided spell
    effect information, range, and selection criteria. It is used to locate targets
    for spells that require targeting within a certain distance or area. The method
    supports various object types and selection types, allowing for flexible targeting
    behavior. This functionality is essential for spell mechanics involving target
    selection and is commonly used in spell processing during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: The spell effect information that defines the type of target to search
      for. This includes the effect type, radius, and other parameters.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance within which to search for targets. This determines
      how far away from the caster's position targets can be found.
  - name: objectType
    description: The type of object to search for (e.g., players, creatures, gameobjects).
      This specifies what kind of target should be considered.
  - name: selectionType
    description: The selection criteria used to determine which targets are valid.
      This includes types like 'nearest' or ' furthest' and other selection methods.
  - name: condList
    description: An optional list of conditions that must be met for a target to be
      considered valid. This allows for filtering based on specific criteria such
      as health, faction, or status.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the found WorldObject that matches the specified criteria,
    or nullptr if no suitable targets are found within the range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: WorldObject* target = spell->SearchNearbyTarget(spellEffectInfo, 10.0f,
      TARGET_TYPE_UNIT, SELECTION_TYPE_NEAREST, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with condition list
    code: WorldObject* target = spell->SearchNearbyTarget(spellEffectInfo, 25.0f,
      TARGET_TYPE_PLAYER, SELECTION_TYPE_FURTHEST, &conditionList);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method uses the spell's effect information to determine how targets are
    selected. Performance depends on the number of objects in the vicinity and complexity
    of conditions. Thread safety is not guaranteed as this method may access shared
    data structures.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with large numbers of
    objects or complex conditions, as it can cause performance issues if not optimized
    properly. Avoid using it in tight loops without proper caching.
