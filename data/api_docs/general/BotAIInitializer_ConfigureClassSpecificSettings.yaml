documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific AI behavior settings for bot characters
  description: Configures AI behavior parameters and decision-making logic based on
    the bot's class. This method sets up class-specific abilities, spell priorities,
    combat strategies, and movement patterns that define how the bot will act in different
    game scenarios. The configuration is applied during bot initialization and affects
    all subsequent AI decisions until explicitly changed. This method ensures that
    each bot type behaves appropriately according to its class mechanics and role
    within the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.ConfigureClassSpecificSettings();

      // Bot now has class-appropriate AI behavior configured'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot during initialization. Modifying
    settings after this point may cause inconsistent AI behavior. The configuration
    is stored internally and affects all AI decision-making processes for that specific
    bot instance.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same bot instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or corrupted AI state. Ensure this is only invoked during bot
    creation or reset operations.
