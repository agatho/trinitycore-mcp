documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another Channel object to this Channel instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source Channel object to this Channel object. This operation is typically
    used in scenarios where a temporary or existing Channel object needs to be efficiently
    reassigned to another Channel instance without unnecessary copying. The source
    Channel is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this method supports
    efficient management of channel-related data structures during player interactions
    with chat channels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current Channel object, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'Channel channel1;

      Channel channel2 = std::move(channel1); // Move-assigns channel1 to channel2

      channel2 = std::move(channel1); // Move-assigns channel1 to channel2 again'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move assignment in function context
    code: "Channel createChannel() {\n    Channel ch;\n    // ... initialize channel\
      \ ...\n    return ch; // Move returns the channel\n}\n\nChannel mainChannel\
      \ = createChannel(); // Uses move assignment"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using std::move semantics and should
    only be used when the source object will not be used afterward. The moved-from
    object remains in a valid state but its contents are unspecified.
  warnings: Do not use the source Channel object after performing a move assignment,
    as its contents are left in an unspecified but valid state. Misuse can lead to
    undefined behavior or resource leaks.
