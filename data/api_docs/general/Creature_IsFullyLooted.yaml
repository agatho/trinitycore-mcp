  class: Creature
  method: IsFullyLooted
  signature: bool Creature::IsFullyLooted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature has completed all loot operations.
  description: This method checks if a creature's loot table has been fully processed,
    meaning that all possible loot items have been distributed to players. It is commonly
    used in game mechanics to ensure that creatures are not eligible for further loot
    distribution after their initial loot has been claimed. The method returns true
    when the creature has no remaining loot to distribute and false otherwise, indicating
    that loot operations are still ongoing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature's loot table is fully processed and no further
    loot can be distributed; returns false if there are still items available for
    distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsFullyLooted()) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related functions
    to determine the state of a creature's loot system. It does not directly affect
    the creature's health or behavior, but rather serves as an indicator for loot
    completion.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with checking if a creature has been
    killed or if its loot has been claimed by players. The method only indicates whether
    all possible loot items have been distributed.
