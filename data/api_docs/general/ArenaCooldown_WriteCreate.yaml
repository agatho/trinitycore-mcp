  class: ArenaCooldown
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ArenaCooldown::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes arena cooldown data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player.
  description: 'The WriteCreate method serializes the arena cooldown information into
    a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission. This method is typically
    used when sending initial arena cooldown state data to a player, such as when
    they join an arena match or when their cooldown status needs to be synchronized
    with the client. The method takes two Player pointers: one representing the owner
    of the cooldown data and another representing the receiver who will be getting
    this information. It ensures that the cooldown data is properly formatted according
    to TrinityCore''s packet structure conventions.'
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized arena cooldown data
      will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose cooldown data is being serialized.
      This represents the source of the cooldown information.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this cooldown data.
      Used for determining proper serialization format and permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena match initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Player with arena cooldown

      Player* receiver = ...; // Player receiving the cooldown info

      ArenaCooldown cooldown;

      cooldown.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending cooldown data during arena match start
    code: "void SendArenaCooldownToPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    ByteBuffer buffer;\n\
      \    Player* arenaOwner = GetArenaOwner();\n    if (arenaOwner)\n    {\n   \
      \     ArenaCooldown cooldown;\n        cooldown.WriteCreate(buffer, arenaOwner,\
      \ player);\n        player->SendDirectMessage(&buffer);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should be called only when preparing data for network transmission. The ByteBuffer
    must be properly initialized before calling this method. Implementation details
    may vary based on the specific arena cooldown type being serialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver Player pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause crashes. This method
    should not be used outside of arena-related contexts unless the underlying data
    structure is properly initialized.
