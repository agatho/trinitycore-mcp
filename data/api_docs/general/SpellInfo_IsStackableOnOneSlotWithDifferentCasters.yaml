  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsStackableOnOneSlotWithDifferentCasters() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether spell effects can stack on the same slot when cast by
    different casters.
  description: This method checks if a spell's effects are allowed to stack in the
    same inventory slot when multiple different casters apply the spell. It is used
    primarily for determining stacking behavior in spell mechanics, particularly in
    scenarios where multiple players or creatures may apply the same spell effect
    to a target. The method evaluates the spell's stacking rules and returns true
    if the spell can stack on the same slot regardless of the caster, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for proper spell handling in World of Warcraft's
    combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell effects can stack on the same slot when cast
    by different casters; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsStackableOnOneSlotWithDifferentCasters()) {\n    // Spell\
      \ can stack on same slot with different casters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell stacking logic
    to determine whether a spell's effects should stack or not. Implementation may
    involve checking the spell's stacking rules, and it's important to note that this
    method does not directly affect the spell's application but rather its stacking
    behavior.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with spell stacking
    mechanics as incorrect usage can lead to improper stacking behavior in combat
    systems. It is recommended to verify the spell's properties before calling this
    method.
