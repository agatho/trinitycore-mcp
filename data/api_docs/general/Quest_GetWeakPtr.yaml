documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier for the quest object
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the unique identifier associated with
    a quest object, which is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage quest
    instances. This identifier helps distinguish between different quest objects in
    memory and ensures proper handling of quest-related operations within the game
    world. The method is typically used for internal tracking purposes rather than
    direct user interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the weak pointer identifier of the
    quest object, which serves as a unique identifier for tracking the quest instance
    in memory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int questId = quest->GetWeakPtr();

      std::cout << "Quest ID: " << questId << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for internal tracking within TrinityCore's
    quest system. It should not be used directly in user-facing code unless explicitly
    required by game mechanics.
  warnings: The returned value may vary depending on the specific implementation and
    does not represent a standard quest ID or GUID. Use with caution when interfacing
    with other systems.
