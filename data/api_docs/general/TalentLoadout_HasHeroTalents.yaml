documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the talent loadout contains hero talents.
  description: The HasHeroTalents method checks if the current talent loadout includes
    any hero talents. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, hero talents
    are special high-level abilities that typically become available at higher character
    levels or through specific game events. This method is commonly used to conditionally
    enable or disable certain gameplay mechanics, UI elements, or quest rewards based
    on whether a player has invested in hero talents within their current loadout.
    The check does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the talent loadout contains at least one hero talent; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for Hero Talents
    code: "if (player->GetTalentLoadout()->HasHeroTalents()) {\n    // Enable special\
      \ UI elements or abilities\n    player->SendNotification(\"Hero talents detected\
      \ in current loadout.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Reward Based on Hero Talents
    code: "if (player->GetTalentLoadout()->HasHeroTalents()) {\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_HEROIC_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n} else {\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_STANDARD_REWARD, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of talent types within the TalentLoadout
    class. It assumes that hero talents are distinctly marked from regular talents
    in the loadout data structure. Performance is generally negligible as it only
    performs a boolean check against stored flags or counts.
  warnings: Ensure that the TalentLoadout object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid loadout may lead to undefined
    behavior. This method does not validate the integrity of the talent data itself.
