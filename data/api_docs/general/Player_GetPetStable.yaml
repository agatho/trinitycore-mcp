  class: Player
  method: GetPetStable
  signature: const int * Player::GetPetStable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the player's pet stable data, which contains information
    about the player's summoned pets.
  description: The GetPetStable method retrieves the pointer to the player's pet stable
    data structure, which holds information about the player's summoned pets including
    their GUIDs and other relevant data. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with the Pet class to access pet-related data stored within the player's pet stable.
    The returned pointer points to a memory location containing pet stable data that
    can be used for various game mechanics operations such as retrieving pet information,
    managing pet summoning, or checking pet availability. The method does not perform
    any direct operations on the data but rather provides access to it for further
    processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const int pointer that points to the pet stable data structure.
    This pointer may be null if no pet stable exists or if the player has not summoned
    any pets yet. The value represents an array of integers containing pet-related
    data including GUIDs and other relevant information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nconst int* petStableData = player->GetPetStable();\n\
      if (petStableData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process pet stable data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method is part of the Player class and typically
    used in conjunction with pet-related functions. The returned pointer should be
    handled carefully as it points to memory that may change during gameplay operations.
    Performance considerations: Accessing this data should be done efficiently as
    it involves direct memory access. Thread safety: This method is generally safe
    for single-threaded access but may require synchronization if accessed from multiple
    threads.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using the returned pointer without checking for null
    values can lead to crashes. Dangerous edge cases: If the player has not summoned
    any pets, the returned pointer might be null, so proper validation is required
    before use.'
