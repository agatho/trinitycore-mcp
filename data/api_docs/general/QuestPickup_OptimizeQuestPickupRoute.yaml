  class: QuestPickup
  method: OptimizeQuestPickupRoute
  signature: void QuestPickup::OptimizeQuestPickupRoute(Player * bot, const int &
    questGivers)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the quest pickup route for a bot player by determining the most
    efficient sequence to visit quest givers.
  description: The OptimizeQuestPickupRoute method calculates and sets an optimized
    path for a bot player to visit all required quest givers in the most time-efficient
    manner. This method is typically used in AI-driven questing systems where the
    bot needs to minimize travel time between quest objectives. The optimization considers
    factors such as distance, map layout, and potential waypoint restrictions. It
    modifies the bot's movement behavior to follow this optimized route, ensuring
    that the player visits each quest giver in an order that minimizes overall travel
    distance and time. This functionality is particularly useful for automated questing
    bots in TrinityCore-based servers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the optimized quest pickup route
  - name: questGivers
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of quest givers
      in the current quest chain or area
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of QuestPickup::OptimizeQuestPickupRoute
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player object

      int numQuestGivers = 5;

      questPickup->OptimizeQuestPickupRoute(myBot, numQuestGivers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic quest giver count
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      int questGiverCount = GetQuestGiverCountForCurrentQuest(bot);

      questPickup->OptimizeQuestPickupRoute(bot, questGiverCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all quest givers are within the same zone or map
    area. The optimization algorithm may not account for dynamic obstacles or real-time
    map changes. The bot's movement behavior is modified directly by this function,
    so it should be called before initiating any quest-related travel.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player who is already in motion may cause unpredictable
    behavior. Ensure that the quest giver count parameter accurately reflects the
    number of active quest givers to avoid incorrect route calculations.
