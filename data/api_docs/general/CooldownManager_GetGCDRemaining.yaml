  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the Global Cooldown (GCD)
    of the player
  description: The GetGCDRemaining method retrieves the current time remaining on
    the Global Cooldown (GCD) for the associated unit. In World of Warcraft, the GCD
    is a universal cooldown that prevents players from casting spells too rapidly.
    This method returns the number of milliseconds until the GCD expires. A return
    value of 0 indicates that the GCD has fully expired and a new spell can be cast
    immediately. The GCD typically lasts 1 second for most classes and abilities,
    though it may vary based on specific game mechanics or modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds remaining
    on the Global Cooldown. If the GCD has expired, returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player can cast a spell
    code: "if (player->GetGCDRemaining() == 0)\n{\n    // Player can cast a new spell\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ must wait for GCD to expire\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You must wait %u ms before casting another spell.\", player->GetGCDRemaining());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement cooldown tracking in a custom spell system
    code: "class CustomSpellHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void CastSpellWithGCD(Unit* caster,\
      \ uint32 spellId)\n    {\n        if (caster->GetGCDRemaining() > 0)\n     \
      \   {\n            // Handle GCD violation or delay casting\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Proceed with spell cast\n        caster->CastSpell(caster,\
      \ spellId, true);\n        \n        // Apply GCD after casting\n        caster->ApplyGCD(1000);\
      \ // 1 second GCD\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting logic to
    enforce game balance. The GCD is applied automatically by the core when a spell
    is cast, and this method allows scripts or systems to query the current state
    of that cooldown. The returned value represents the exact time remaining and can
    be used for UI updates or gameplay logic.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on a unit without a valid GCD context
    may return unexpected values. Always ensure proper initialization of the unit's
    cooldown system before querying GCD status.
