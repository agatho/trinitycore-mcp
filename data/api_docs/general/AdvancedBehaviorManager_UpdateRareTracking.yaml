documentation:
  brief: Updates rare creature tracking state for all active behaviors in the manager.
  description: The UpdateRareTracking method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the tracking status of rare creatures within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This
    method processes the internal tracking data structures to ensure that rare mob
    encounters are properly monitored and managed across all active AI behaviors.
    It typically handles state transitions, cooldowns, and updates to tracking flags
    based on elapsed time or event triggers. The method is called periodically by
    the game loop to maintain accurate tracking information for rare spawns and their
    associated behavior states.

    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateRareTracking(diff);\n\
      \    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop with a time
    delta parameter. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, performing
    only necessary tracking updates without complex computations or database operations.
