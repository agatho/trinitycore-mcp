  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: SetData
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SetData(uint32 id, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets custom data values for a smart game object AI instance, typically used
    to store and retrieve state information during quest events or scripted behaviors.
  description: 'The SetData method allows smart game object AI instances to store
    and manage custom integer-based data values. This functionality is commonly used
    in TrinityCore''s smart scripting system to maintain state information for game
    objects during quest progression, event handling, or scripted interactions. The
    method accepts two uint32 parameters: an ID to identify the data field and a value
    to assign to that field. These data values can be retrieved later using corresponding
    getter methods within the AI system. The implementation typically stores these
    values in internal member variables or associated data structures that persist
    during the object''s lifetime. This mechanism enables complex scripted behaviors
    where game objects need to remember state across multiple events or interactions.'
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier for the data field to be set. This ID is used
      to distinguish between different data values stored by the AI instance and should
      correspond to predefined data fields in the smart script configuration.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value to assign to the specified data field identified
      by 'id'. This can represent any numeric state information such as quest progress,
      event flags, or custom counters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Quest Progress Flag
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override\n{\n  \
      \  // Set a flag indicating that the quest has been accepted\n    SetData(QUEST_ACCEPTED_FLAG,\
      \ 1);\n}\n\nvoid OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override\n\
      {\n    // Update the data when quest is completed\n    SetData(QUEST_COMPLETED_FLAG,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Managing Object State for Scripted Events
    code: "void OnGameObjectStateChanged(uint32 state) override\n{\n    // Store the\
      \ current state of the game object\n    SetData(OBJECT_STATE_ID, state);\n \
      \   \n    // Trigger additional logic based on stored state\n    if (GetData(OBJECT_STATE_ID)\
      \ == STATE_ACTIVATED)\n    {\n        // Perform activation actions\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the smart AI system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the broader smart scripting framework. The data values set through this method
    are typically persistent during the object's lifetime but may be reset or cleared
    when the AI is reinitialized. Developers should ensure that the ID values used
    are consistent with those defined in their smart script configurations to avoid
    confusion or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Avoid using excessively large ID values as they may impact memory usage
    or performance. Ensure that data IDs are properly documented and consistently
    used across all related scripts and AI implementations. Setting data values without
    proper validation can lead to unexpected behavior if the values exceed expected
    ranges or conflict with other systems.
