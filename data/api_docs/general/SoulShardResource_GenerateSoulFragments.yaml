  class: SoulShardResource
  method: GenerateSoulFragments
  signature: void SoulShardResource::GenerateSoulFragments(uint32 fragments)
documentation:
  brief: Generates soul fragments for the player's soul shard resource.
  description: The GenerateSoulFragments method increases the amount of soul fragments
    available in a player's soul shard resource by the specified count. This method
    is typically invoked when a player performs actions that generate soul fragments,
    such as killing demons or using certain spells. The generated fragments contribute
    to the player's ability to cast soul shard-based abilities like Soul Fire or Shadow
    Bolt. This method does not directly interact with the player's inventory but modifies
    internal resource tracking for soul shards.
  parameters:
  - name: fragments
    description: The number of soul fragments to generate and add to the player's
      soul shard resource. Must be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      SoulShardResource* soulShardResource = player->GetSoulShardResource();

      soulShardResource->GenerateSoulFragments(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Fragments Based on Spell Effect
    code: "void OnSpellHit(Unit* caster, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    if (spellInfo->Id\
      \ == 12345) // Example demon killing spell\n    {\n        Player* player =\
      \ caster->ToPlayer();\n        if (player)\n        {\n            SoulShardResource*\
      \ soulShardResource = player->GetSoulShardResource();\n            soulShardResource->GenerateSoulFragments(3);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates the internal soul shard resource state. It is recommended
    to call this method only when appropriate game events occur, such as successful
    demon kills or specific spell casts. The actual visual feedback for generated
    fragments should be handled separately by UI systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the fragment count passed is valid and non-negative. Passing
    a negative value may lead to unexpected behavior in resource tracking. This method
    does not validate whether the player has sufficient capacity to store additional
    fragments, so calling it excessively without checking limits might cause overflow
    or inconsistent state.
