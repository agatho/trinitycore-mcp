  method: IsInLFG
  signature: bool LFGBotSelector::IsInLFG(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified bot player is currently participating in a Looking
    for Group (LFG) activity.
  description: The IsInLFG method determines whether a given bot player is currently
    engaged in a Looking for Group (LFG) activity within the World of Warcraft environment.
    This method is typically used by LFG bots to assess their current status and avoid
    duplicate or conflicting LFG attempts. It evaluates the player's participation
    state in LFG queues, dungeons, raids, or other group activities. The method returns
    true if the bot is actively participating in an LFG activity, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining proper bot behavior and preventing
    conflicts with real players or other automated systems.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose LFG status
      is being checked. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot player is currently participating in
    an LFG activity, such as being queued for a dungeon, raid, or group finder activity.
    Returns false if the bot is not currently engaged in any LFG activity or if the
    player object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is in LFG
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance\nif (LFGBotSelector::IsInLFG(myBot))\
      \ {\n    // Bot is currently in an LFG activity\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"system\", \"\
      Bot {} is in LFG\", myBot->GetName());\n} else {\n    // Bot is not in any LFG\
      \ activity\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"system\", \"Bot {} is not in LFG\", myBot->GetName());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInLFG in bot decision logic
    code: "class MyLFGBot {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        if (IsInLFG(bot_))\
      \ {\n            // Bot is already in LFG, do not queue again\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Bot is free to join LFG\n        JoinLFG();\n\
      \    }\nprivate:\n    Player* bot_;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal LFG state flags or queue information associated
    with the player object. It may also consider the player's current zone, instance
    status, and group membership to determine LFG participation. The implementation
    might involve checking the player's LFG dungeon list, queued status, or active
    group membership.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null to avoid undefined behavior. This method should only be called on bot players,
    as it's designed specifically for automated player behavior management.
