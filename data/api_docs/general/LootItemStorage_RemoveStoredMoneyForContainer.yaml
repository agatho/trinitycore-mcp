  class: LootItemStorage
  method: RemoveStoredMoneyForContainer
  signature: void LootItemStorage::RemoveStoredMoneyForContainer(uint64 containerId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes stored money associated with a specific container from the loot item
    storage.
  description: The RemoveStoredMoneyForContainer method removes any stored monetary
    information that was previously associated with a given container ID in the LootItemStorage
    system. This function is typically used during loot processing to clean up temporary
    or cached monetary data after a container (such as a loot chest or corpse) has
    been fully processed. The method operates on the internal storage structure of
    the LootItemStorage class and does not directly interact with game objects or
    players. It assumes that the container ID provided is valid and corresponds to
    an existing entry in the storage.
  parameters:
  - name: containerId
    description: A unique identifier (GUID) representing the container from which
      stored money should be removed. This value must correspond to a valid container
      in the loot system, such as a game object or player corpse.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Money for a Loot Container
    code: 'LootItemStorage* storage = sObjectMgr->GetLootItemStorage();

      uint64 containerGuid = 123456789ULL;

      storage->RemoveStoredMoneyForContainer(containerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot management system and should only
    be called when the container's loot has been fully processed. It does not perform
    any validation on the container ID, so calling it with an invalid or non-existent
    GUID may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid containerId can result in unexpected
    behavior or corruption of internal data structures. Ensure that the container
    ID is valid and corresponds to a real loot container before invoking this function.
