  class: Unit
  method: SendMoveKnockBack
  signature: void Unit::SendMoveKnockBack(int * player, float speedXY, float speedZ,
    float vcos, float vsin)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a knockback movement for the specified player with given parameters.
  description: This method sends a knockback movement to a player, causing them to
    be pushed back with specific speed and direction values. The function is typically
    used in game mechanics where players are subjected to force-based movements such
    as knockback effects from spells or abilities. It allows control over the XY speed,
    vertical speed, cosine and sine of the angle, enabling precise control of movement
    direction and magnitude.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that will be affected by the knockback
      movement. This parameter is crucial for identifying which player receives the
      movement.
  - name: speedXY
    description: The horizontal speed of the knockback movement, determining how fast
      the player moves in the X/Y plane.
  - name: speedZ
    description: The vertical speed of the knockback movement, controlling how high
      the player is pushed upward.
  - name: vcos
    description: Cosine of the angle for the knockback direction, used to calculate
      horizontal movement direction.
  - name: vsin
    description: Sine of the angle for the knockback direction, used to calculate
      horizontal movement direction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SendMoveKnockBack(&player, 5.0f, 3.0f, 0.707f, 0.707f);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires careful handling of parameters to ensure correct movement
    behavior. It should be used in conjunction with proper game mechanics logic to
    avoid unintended player movement or visual artifacts.
  warnings: Improper use of speed parameters can lead to incorrect movement direction
    or magnitude, potentially causing players to move in unexpected ways or even fall
    through the world.
