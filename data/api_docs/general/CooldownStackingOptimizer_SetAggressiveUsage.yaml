  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: SetAggressiveUsage
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::SetAggressiveUsage(bool aggressive)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the cooldown stacking optimizer should use aggressive usage
    behavior for spell cooldown management.
  description: The SetAggressiveUsage method configures the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    to either employ aggressive or conservative cooldown management strategies. When
    set to true, the optimizer will prioritize using spells as soon as possible within
    their cooldown constraints, potentially sacrificing long-term resource efficiency
    for immediate tactical advantage. When set to false, it follows a more conservative
    approach, managing cooldowns to maximize overall usage over time. This setting
    directly impacts how abilities are scheduled and executed in combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: aggressive
    description: Boolean flag determining the cooldown management strategy. True enables
      aggressive usage (prioritizes immediate spell activation), false enables conservative
      usage (optimizes long-term cooldown efficiency).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Aggressive Cooldown Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetAggressiveUsage(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Aggressive Cooldown Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetAggressiveUsage(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal cooldown scheduling logic of the optimizer.
    Changes take effect immediately for subsequent spell evaluations and may influence
    AI decision-making during active combat encounters.
