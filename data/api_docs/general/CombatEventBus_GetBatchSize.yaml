  method: GetBatchSize
  signature: uint32 CombatEventBus::GetBatchSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of combat events that can be processed in a single
    batch.
  description: The GetBatchSize method retrieves the configured maximum size for combat
    event batches within the CombatEventBus system. This value determines how many
    combat-related events (such as damage dealt, healing done, or spell casts) will
    be grouped together before being processed by the event handling subsystem. The
    batch size is typically set during initialization and affects performance by balancing
    memory usage and processing efficiency. Events are collected until the batch reaches
    this size or a timeout occurs, at which point they are dispatched for processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of combat events that can
    be included in a single processing batch. This value is typically between 1 and
    several hundred depending on server configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Combat Event Batch Size
    code: 'uint32 batchSize = combatEventBus.GetBatchSize();

      TC_LOG_INFO("combat", "Current combat event batch size: {}", batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Batch Size for Performance Monitoring
    code: "uint32 currentBatchSize = combatEventBus.GetBatchSize();\nif (currentBatchSize\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"combat\", \"Large batch size detected: {} events\
      \ per batch\", currentBatchSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value should not change during runtime unless explicitly modified through
    configuration or system initialization routines. This value directly impacts how
    frequently combat events are flushed from the internal buffer to the processing
    pipeline.
