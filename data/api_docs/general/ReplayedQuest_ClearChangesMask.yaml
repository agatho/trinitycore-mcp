documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of a replayed quest, resetting its modified state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a ReplayedQuest instance. This operation effectively marks the quest as no
    longer having pending modifications, which is typically used after saving or synchronizing
    quest data. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return value
    operations. It's commonly invoked during quest update cycles or when preparing
    to save quest state to persistent storage. This functionality ensures that subsequent
    checks for quest changes will not detect previously processed modifications.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ClearChangesMask
    code: 'ReplayedQuest quest;

      // ... perform some quest modifications ...

      quest.ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the changes mask after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore quest system
    when synchronizing quest data. It's important to understand that clearing the
    mask does not undo actual quest progress or state changes; it only resets tracking
    of which aspects have been modified.
