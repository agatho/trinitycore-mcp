documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's dodge percentage based on their current attributes and
    combat state
  description: The UpdateDodgePercentage method recalculates and applies the player's
    dodge chance, taking into account various factors such as agility, level, equipped
    armor, and any active buffs or debuffs. This method is typically invoked during
    combat state changes, stat updates, or when the player's equipment configuration
    is modified. The calculated dodge percentage is then used by the game engine to
    determine whether incoming attacks are dodged. This method does not directly modify
    the player's dodge chance value but rather updates internal calculations that
    affect combat outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update dodge percentage after equipment change
    code: "void OnEquipmentChange(Player* player)\n{\n    // After updating player's\
      \ gear\n    player->UpdateDodgePercentage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core when relevant player attributes
    change. It should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom
    game mechanics or debugging purposes. The calculation considers base dodge chance,
    agility bonus, and armor penetration effects.
  warnings: Invoking this method excessively can cause performance issues due to recalculating
    combat statistics. Avoid calling it in tight loops or during frequent stat updates
    without proper batching.
