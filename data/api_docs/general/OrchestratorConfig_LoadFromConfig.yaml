  class: OrchestratorConfig
  method: LoadFromConfig
  signature: void OrchestratorConfig::LoadFromConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Loads configuration settings for the orchestrator from the active configuration
    source.
  description: The LoadFromConfig method initializes and populates the OrchestratorConfig
    class with values derived from the game's configuration system. This method is
    typically invoked during server startup or when configuration changes need to
    be reloaded at runtime. It reads relevant settings such as behavior flags, timing
    parameters, and operational thresholds from the TrinityCore configuration files
    or database entries. The method ensures that all internal configuration variables
    are properly set before the orchestrator begins its operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'OrchestratorConfig config;

      config.LoadFromConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the configuration system has been
    initialized. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in a single-threaded
    context during startup or configuration reloads. The method may trigger internal
    validation of loaded values, which could result in default fallbacks if invalid
    configurations are detected.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that no active orchestrator processes
    are running when reloading configuration to avoid runtime errors.
