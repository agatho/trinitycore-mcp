api:
  class: GuildBankManager
  method: GetFrequentUsers
  signature: int GuildBankManager::GetFrequentUsers(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of frequent users in a guild's bank.
  description: The GetFrequentUsers method calculates and returns the number of players
    who have accessed the guild bank frequently within a specified time frame. This
    functionality is used to track active guild members and potentially determine
    rewards or privileges based on bank usage. The method internally queries the guild
    bank transaction logs and applies heuristics to identify users with high access
    frequency. It does not require any parameters as it operates on the current guild
    context, likely determined by the calling object's state or a global guild identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of frequent users in the guild
    bank. Returns 0 if no frequent users are found or if the guild has no transaction
    history.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int frequentUsers = guildBankManager->GetFrequentUsers(12345);\nif (frequentUsers\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << frequentUsers << \" frequent users\
      \ in the guild bank.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to analyze guild bank transaction
    logs. It may cache results or use time-based thresholds to define 'frequent' access,
    which could affect performance if called frequently. The exact definition of 'frequent'
    (e.g., number of transactions or time window) is not specified but would typically
    be configurable in the core settings.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without caching may cause performance degradation
    due to database queries. Ensure that the guild ID provided is valid and corresponds
    to an existing guild, otherwise behavior is undefined.
