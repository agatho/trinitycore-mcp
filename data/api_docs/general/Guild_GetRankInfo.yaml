api:
  class: Guild
  method: GetRankInfo
  signature: RankInfo * Guild::GetRankInfo(GuildRankOrder rankOrder)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the rank information structure for a specified guild rank order.
  description: The GetRankInfo method returns a pointer to the RankInfo structure
    associated with a given guild rank order. This method allows access to detailed
    information about a specific rank within the guild, including permissions, name,
    and other rank-specific properties. The returned pointer is valid only as long
    as the guild object remains in scope and the rank exists. This functionality is
    essential for managing guild hierarchies and determining player privileges within
    the guild system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a RankInfo structure representing the rank information for
    the specified rank order, or nullptr if the rank order is invalid or does not
    exist.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Guild Rank Information
    code: "Guild* guild = ...; // Assume guild object is initialized\nRankInfo* rankInfo\
      \ = guild->GetRankInfo(GuildRankOrder::GRO_INITIATE);\nif (rankInfo != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Rank Name: \" << rankInfo->name << std::endl;\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Permissions: \" << rankInfo->permissions << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the Guild object has been properly initialized with
    valid rank data. The returned RankInfo pointer should not be modified directly
    as it's managed by the guild system.
