documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all area trigger spawns from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadAreaTriggerSpawns method is responsible for retrieving all
    defined area trigger spawn data from the TrinityCore database and loading it into
    the in-memory data store. This method ensures that all area triggers, which are
    used to detect player presence and trigger various game events such as quests,
    combat encounters, or environmental effects, are properly initialized and available
    for use during world updates. It typically runs during server startup or when
    the area trigger data is refreshed. The method performs database queries to fetch
    spawn locations, associated scripts, and other relevant properties for each area
    trigger.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'AreaTriggerDataStore* atStore = AreaTriggerDataStore::Instance();

      atStore->LoadAreaTriggerSpawns(); // Called during server startup to load all
      area triggers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during server initialization. It's important
    that the database connection is active and valid before calling this method, otherwise
    it may fail silently or cause runtime errors. The loaded data is stored in a container
    (likely a map or vector) for fast lookup during world updates.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. It should only be called once per server session
    unless the data store is explicitly cleared.
