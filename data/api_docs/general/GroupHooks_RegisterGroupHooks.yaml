  signature: void GroupHooks::RegisterGroupHooks()
documentation:
  brief: Registers group-related hooks for handling player group events and actions
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The GroupHooks::RegisterGroupHooks method initializes and registers
    various callback functions or event handlers that are triggered when specific
    group-related activities occur in the game world. These hooks allow custom code
    to intercept and modify behavior during group creation, member addition/removal,
    leader changes, loot distribution, and other group operations. The method typically
    sets up internal tracking mechanisms and links to the core game systems that manage
    player groups. This registration process is essential for extending or modifying
    default group functionality without directly altering core TrinityCore source
    code.

  - title: Basic Hook Registration
    code: "void MyMod::Initialize()\n{\n    GroupHooks::RegisterGroupHooks();\n  \
      \  // Custom group handling logic now active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or module
    loading to ensure all group-related events are properly intercepted. The registration
    process may involve setting up internal lists of callback functions that are invoked
    at specific points in the group lifecycle.
  warnings: Improper handling of registered hooks can lead to crashes or unexpected
    behavior in group operations. Ensure that all registered callbacks are thread-safe
    and do not perform blocking operations that could affect server performance.
