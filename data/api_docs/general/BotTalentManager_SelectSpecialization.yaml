  class: BotTalentManager
  method: SelectSpecialization
  signature: SpecChoice BotTalentManager::SelectSpecialization(uint8 cls, int faction,
    uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the most appropriate talent specialization for a bot based on class,
    faction, and level.
  description: The SelectSpecialization method determines and returns the optimal
    talent specialization for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It
    evaluates the provided class, faction, and level parameters to choose an appropriate
    spec that aligns with game mechanics and bot behavior guidelines. This method
    is typically used during bot initialization or when rebalancing bot characters
    to ensure they follow standard gameplay strategies. The selection process considers
    class-specific talent trees, faction-based restrictions, and level-appropriate
    talent points distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The character class of the bot (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin,
      etc.). Valid values correspond to the standard World of Warcraft class IDs.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the bot (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde). Determines
      faction-specific talent restrictions and availability.
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the bot character. Used to determine appropriate
      specialization based on level requirements and talent point allocation.
  returns: Returns a SpecChoice enum value representing the selected talent specialization.
    The exact values depend on the internal implementation but typically correspond
    to specific specialization IDs within the game's talent system.
  examples:
  - title: Selecting a Warrior Specialization
    code: 'BotTalentManager talentMgr;

      SpecChoice choice = talentMgr.SelectSpecialization(1, 0, 60);

      // Returns appropriate warrior specialization for Alliance at level 60'
    language: cpp
  - title: Selecting a Mage Specialization by Faction
    code: 'BotTalentManager talentMgr;

      SpecChoice choice = talentMgr.SelectSpecialization(8, 1, 50);

      // Returns appropriate mage specialization for Horde at level 50'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and should only be called during
    bot initialization or when recalculating optimal specs. The implementation likely
    uses internal tables or algorithms to map class/faction/level combinations to
    appropriate specializations. Performance is generally not a concern as this is
    typically called infrequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided class, faction, and level values are valid and
    within expected ranges. Invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior or
    inappropriate specialization selection. This method should not be called during
    active combat or when bot state is critical to avoid disrupting gameplay.
