documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has tapped the creature.
  description: This method checks if a specific player has successfully tapped the
    creature, meaning they have initiated combat with it and are considered its attacker.
    The method returns true if the player has tapped the creature, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for determining player engagement with creatures
    in World of Warcraft's combat system, particularly when dealing with creature
    AI behavior and player versus creature interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has tapped the creature, false otherwise. The
    method essentially checks if the player has established a valid combat relationship
    with the creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->isTappedBy(player)) {\n    // Player has tapped the creature\n\
      \    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related functions
    to determine player engagement status. It may be called during creature AI updates
    or when checking player interaction with a creature.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a player has killed
    the creature, as it only checks for tapping, not for killing. Also note that this
    method does not check for player's current target status, but rather whether they
    have established combat with the creature.
