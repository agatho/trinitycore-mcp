  class: MaelstromWeaponTracker
  method: IsMaxStacks
  signature: bool MaelstromWeaponTracker::IsMaxStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Maelstrom weapon tracker has reached its maximum stack
    count.
  description: The IsMaxStacks method determines if the current stack count of the
    Maelstrom weapon effect has reached the maximum allowed stacks. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's combat system to control abilities that scale with
    stacking effects, such as those from the Maelstrom weapon talent. The method performs
    a simple comparison between the current stack count and the maximum stack limit,
    returning true if they are equal and false otherwise. This check is typically
    performed before applying new stacks or triggering effects that depend on reaching
    maximum stack capacity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current stack count equals the maximum allowed stacks;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Stack Check
    code: "if (maelstromTracker->IsMaxStacks()) {\n    // Trigger special effect when\
      \ max stacks reached\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_MAELOSTRUM_FULL_STACK_EFFECT,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Stack Application
    code: "if (!maelstromTracker->IsMaxStacks()) {\n    maelstromTracker->AddStack();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle max stack overflow or reset logic\n    maelstromTracker->ResetStacks();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Maelstrom weapon
    tracking methods to manage the state of the weapon effect. The maximum stack count
    is usually defined by the game mechanics and may vary based on player talents
    or gear. This method does not modify internal state; it only performs a read-only
    check.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a primary means of managing stack application
    logic, as it doesn't prevent overstacking. Always ensure proper stack management
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior in combat systems.
