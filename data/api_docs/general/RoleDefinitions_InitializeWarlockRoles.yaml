  method: InitializeWarlockRoles
  signature: void RoleDefinitions::InitializeWarlockRoles()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes role definitions specific to warlock class abilities and gameplay
    mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeWarlockRoles method sets up and configures all role-related
    definitions and behaviors associated with the warlock class in World of Warcraft.
    This includes defining spell roles, talent build recommendations, and combat behavior
    patterns that are unique to warlocks. The method ensures that all warlock-specific
    role data is properly initialized and available for use during gameplay, including
    handling class-specific mechanics such as pet management, soul shard tracking,
    and affliction/holy/arcane specialization roles. This initialization typically
    occurs during server startup or when loading class-specific configurations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializeWarlockRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the TrinityCore server. It is typically invoked by the core system when class
    configurations are being loaded, and subsequent calls may result in undefined
    behavior or data corruption.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper initialization sequence
    as it may interfere with other systems that depend on role definitions being stable.
    This method modifies internal state and should not be called concurrently from
    multiple threads.
