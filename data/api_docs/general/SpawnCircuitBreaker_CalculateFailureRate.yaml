documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the failure rate of the spawn circuit breaker as a
    floating-point value.
  description: The CalculateFailureRate method computes the current failure rate of
    the spawn circuit breaker, which is typically used to monitor the reliability
    of object spawning within the TrinityCore server. This value represents how often
    spawn operations have failed relative to successful attempts over a defined time
    window or sample period. The method performs no side effects and is read-only
    in nature. It may be used by internal systems or external tools to assess system
    health, detect anomalies, or trigger alerts when failure rates exceed predefined
    thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated failure rate of the spawn circuit
    breaker. This value typically ranges from 0.0 (no failures) to 1.0 (all operations
    failed), though specific implementation details may vary depending on how the
    circuit breaker tracks and normalizes its internal statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;

      float failureRate = breaker.CalculateFailureRate();

      std::cout << "Current failure rate: " << failureRate << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring System Health
    code: "void MonitorSpawnSystem(SpawnCircuitBreaker& breaker) {\n    float rate\
      \ = breaker.CalculateFailureRate();\n    if (rate > 0.1f) {\n        // Log\
      \ warning or trigger alert\n        sLog->outError(\"High spawn failure rate\
      \ detected: %.2f\", rate);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the circuit breaker maintains internal counters
    for successful and failed spawn operations. The calculation logic may involve
    time-based decay or fixed windowing to provide a meaningful metric over recent
    activity rather than cumulative totals.
