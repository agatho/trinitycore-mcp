documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LearningTrend class with default values.
  description: The LearningTrend constructor initializes a new instance of the LearningTrend
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, typically initializing
    member variables to their default values or null states. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation framework, this constructor likely prepares the object
    for tracking learning trends or patterns related to player behavior, skill acquisition,
    or game progression metrics. The initialization process ensures that all data
    members are properly configured before the object is used in gameplay logic or
    data processing routines.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'LearningTrend trend;

      // Initializes a new LearningTrend object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a LearningTrend
    variable on the stack. Developers should be aware that any member variables requiring
    specific initialization beyond default values should be handled in the constructor
    body or through explicit initialization lists.
