documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CombatEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the CombatEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the combat event bus exists throughout
    the application. This instance is responsible for managing and dispatching combat-related
    events such as damage dealt, healing received, and other combat actions within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method is thread-safe and provides access to a
    globally available combat event handling system that other subsystems can use
    to register listeners or broadcast combat events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single CombatEventBus instance. This pointer is never
    null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the CombatEventBus singleton
    code: 'CombatEventBus* eventBus = CombatEventBus::instance();

      // Use eventBus to register event handlers or dispatch events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a combat event listener
    code: "CombatEventBus* bus = CombatEventBus::instance();\nbus->RegisterListener([](const\
      \ CombatEvent& event) {\n    // Handle combat event\n    std::cout << \"Combat\
      \ event: \" << event.GetType() << std::endl;\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The CombatEventBus instance is typically initialized during server startup and
    remains valid for the lifetime of the application. It's designed to be thread-safe,
    though individual event handling may require additional synchronization depending
    on implementation details.
