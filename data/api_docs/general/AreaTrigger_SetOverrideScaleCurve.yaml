  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetOverrideScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetOverrideScaleCurve(const int & points, int startTimeOffset,
    int interpolation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the override scale curve for an area trigger, defining how its scale
    changes over time.
  description: The SetOverrideScaleCurve method configures a scaling animation for
    an AreaTrigger object by specifying a set of points that define the curve. This
    allows developers to create dynamic visual effects where the area trigger's size
    changes over time, such as expanding or contracting effects. The method takes
    parameters that control the number of points in the curve, the start time offset,
    and the interpolation type used between points. This functionality is commonly
    used for spell effects, environmental animations, or any scenario requiring animated
    area triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The number of points defining the scale curve. This determines how
      many keyframes are used to define the scaling behavior over time.
  - name: startTimeOffset
    description: The time offset in milliseconds from when the curve should begin
      relative to the area trigger's activation. A positive value delays the start
      of the animation.
  - name: interpolation
    description: The interpolation method used between curve points. Valid values
      typically represent linear, cubic, or other interpolation types that control
      how the scale transitions between keyframes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->SetOverrideScaleCurve(3, 0, 1); // 3 points, no offset, linear interpolation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed Scaling Animation
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->SetOverrideScaleCurve(5, 500, 2); // 5 points, 500ms delay, cubic interpolation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the area trigger's visual properties dynamically during
    runtime. The curve points are typically defined in a separate data structure or
    database entry that maps time to scale values. Ensure that the interpolation type
    matches the intended animation behavior for optimal visual results.
  warnings: Incorrect point counts or invalid interpolation types may cause undefined
    behavior or visual glitches. The startTimeOffset should be carefully considered
    to avoid timing conflicts with other animations or effects.
