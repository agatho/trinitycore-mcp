  class: InteractionManager
  method: EnableAutoSell
  signature: void InteractionManager::EnableAutoSell(Player * bot, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auto-sell feature for a specified player bot.
  description: The EnableAutoSell method controls whether a player bot automatically
    sells items that meet certain criteria, such as gray-quality items or items that
    are no longer needed. This functionality is typically used in automated gameplay
    systems or AI bots to manage inventory efficiently without manual intervention.
    When enabled, the bot will periodically evaluate its inventory and sell qualifying
    items according to configured rules. The method operates on a per-bot basis and
    does not affect other players or bots in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which auto-sell
      functionality is being enabled or disabled.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the auto-sell feature for the specified bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Sell for a Bot
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      InteractionManager::EnableAutoSell(myBot, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Sell for a Bot
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      InteractionManager::EnableAutoSell(myBot, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the InteractionManager class.
    It does not directly interact with the game's item database or inventory system
    but rather toggles a behavior flag that is checked during inventory management
    operations. The effect of enabling auto-sell may vary depending on other bot configuration
    settings such as sell thresholds and item categorization rules.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unintended loss of items if the
    bot's selling criteria are not properly configured. Ensure that any automated
    selling behavior aligns with desired gameplay mechanics to avoid accidental disposal
    of valuable or quest-relevant items.
