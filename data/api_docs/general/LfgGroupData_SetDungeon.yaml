  class: LfgGroupData
  method: SetDungeon
  signature: void LfgGroupData::SetDungeon(uint32 dungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the dungeon ID for the LFG group data.
  description: The SetDungeon method assigns a specific dungeon identifier to the
    LFG (Looking For Group) group data object. This method is typically used during
    the process of forming or modifying a group for dungeon finding activities in
    World of Warcraft. The dungeon ID corresponds to a specific instance or raid that
    players are attempting to complete together. This setter method updates an internal
    member variable within the LfgGroupData class, which may be used by the LFG system
    to track group composition and dungeon preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeon
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon or instance that the group is
      assigned to. This value typically corresponds to an entry in the game's dungeon
      database, such as a map ID or instance template ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Dungeon for LFG Group
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.SetDungeon(1234); // Assigns dungeon with ID 1234 to the group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system's internal data management and is usually
    invoked when a group leader selects or changes the dungeon they wish to attempt.
    It does not directly trigger any game events or UI updates; those are handled
    separately by the LFG manager.
