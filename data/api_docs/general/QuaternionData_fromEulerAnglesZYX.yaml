  class: QuaternionData
  method: fromEulerAnglesZYX
  signature: QuaternionData QuaternionData::fromEulerAnglesZYX(float Z, float Y, float
    X)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a quaternion from ZYX Euler angles representing rotation around the
    local axes in that order.
  description: The fromEulerAnglesZYX method constructs and returns a QuaternionData
    object based on three Euler angles specified in ZYX order (yaw, pitch, roll).
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft for character orientation and animation
    systems where rotations are defined as sequential extrinsic rotations around the
    fixed world axes. The resulting quaternion can be used for smooth interpolation,
    rotation transformations, or integration with the game's physics engine. Note
    that Euler angle conventions may differ between systems, so ensure consistency
    when converting between different representations.
  parameters:
  - name: Z
    description: Rotation angle around the Z-axis (yaw) in radians. Positive values
      rotate counterclockwise when looking down the positive Z-axis.
  - name: Y
    description: Rotation angle around the Y-axis (pitch) in radians. Positive values
      rotate upward when looking along the positive Y-axis.
  - name: X
    description: Rotation angle around the X-axis (roll) in radians. Positive values
      rotate counterclockwise when looking down the positive X-axis.
  returns: A new QuaternionData object representing the rotation specified by the
    ZYX Euler angles. The quaternion is normalized to ensure it represents a valid
    rotation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Character Orientation
    code: 'QuaternionData orientation = QuaternionData::fromEulerAnglesZYX(0.5f, 0.2f,
      0.1f);

      // Creates a quaternion representing 0.5 radians yaw, 0.2 radians pitch, and
      0.1 radians roll'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Unit Movement Direction
    code: 'float yaw = player->GetOrientation();

      float pitch = 0.0f;

      float roll = 0.0f;

      QuaternionData rotation = QuaternionData::fromEulerAnglesZYX(yaw, pitch, roll);

      // Sets up a quaternion for character facing direction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the standard right-handed coordinate system used in TrinityCore.
    The ZYX order implies extrinsic rotations (rotations around fixed world axes),
    which is different from intrinsic rotations (around local axes). This convention
    is common in game engines for camera and object orientation calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when converting between Euler angles and quaternions, as Euler
    angles can suffer from gimbal lock. Also, ensure that input angle values are within
    reasonable ranges to avoid unexpected behavior or numerical instability.
