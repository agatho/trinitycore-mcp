  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: GetPlayerEventMetrics
  signature: EventMetrics GuildEventCoordinator::GetPlayerEventMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves event participation metrics for a specified player within the guild.
  description: The GetPlayerEventMetrics method fetches detailed event participation
    statistics for a given player identified by their GUID. This includes data such
    as completed events, event types participated in, and performance metrics relevant
    to guild activities. The method is typically used by guild management systems
    or event coordinators to analyze player engagement and contributions to guild
    events. It accesses internal tracking structures within the GuildEventCoordinator
    to compile this information for the requested player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose event metrics are
      being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the current realm.
  returns: An EventMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about the player's
    participation in guild events, including counts, types, and performance indicators.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized EventMetrics object if no data is found
    for the specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "EventMetrics metrics = guildEventCoordinator.GetPlayerEventMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (!metrics.IsEmpty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Events completed: \" << metrics.GetCompletedEvents()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Player Engagement
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nEventMetrics metrics\
      \ = guildEventCoordinator.GetPlayerEventMetrics(playerGuid);\nif (metrics.GetCompletedEvents()\
      \ > 10) {\n    // Player is highly engaged in guild events\n    SendSystemMessageToPlayer(player,\
      \ \"You're a frequent event participant!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups or internal data structure traversals
    depending on how event tracking is implemented. It's recommended to cache results
    when querying metrics for multiple players to avoid performance degradation. The
    EventMetrics object returned should be treated as immutable after retrieval.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual online or
    offline player in the realm; invalid GUIDs may result in empty or default return
    values without error indication. Avoid calling this method excessively in tight
    loops as it could impact performance.
