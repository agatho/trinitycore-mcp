  signature: bool Creature::_IsTargetAcceptable(const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target is acceptable for the creature's AI behavior
  description: This method evaluates whether a given target is suitable for the creature's
    current AI state, considering factors such as target type, distance, and validity.
    It is commonly used in creature AI scripts to ensure that targets meet specific
    criteria before proceeding with actions. The method typically checks if the target
    is valid, within range, and appropriate for the creature's current behavior or
    attack pattern.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index.
      This value is used to determine if the target is acceptable based on creature's
      AI logic.
  returns: Returns true if the target is acceptable for the creature's AI behavior,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the target is invalid, out of
    range, or not suitable for the creature's current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->_IsTargetAcceptable(&target)) {\n    // Proceed with AI action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "bool result = creature->_IsTargetAcceptable(&target);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Target is acceptable, proceed with attack logic\n} else {\n    // Target\
      \ is not acceptable, skip action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    and should be called within the context of creature's AI state machine. Performance
    considerations include checking target validity quickly to avoid unnecessary delays
    in AI execution.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context, as it
    may lead to incorrect behavior if used outside of a valid AI state. Also, ensure
    that the target parameter is properly initialized before calling this method.
