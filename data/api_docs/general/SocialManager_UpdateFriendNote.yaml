  signature: void SocialManager::UpdateFriendNote(int playerGuid, const std::string
    & note)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the note associated with a friend in the social manager.
  description: The UpdateFriendNote method modifies or sets a custom note for a specified
    friend in the player's social list. This functionality allows players to add personal
    annotations or reminders about their friends, which are stored and managed within
    the social manager system. The method takes a player GUID to identify the specific
    friend and a string note that will be associated with that friend. Changes made
    through this method are typically persisted in the database and synchronized across
    the game session.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose friend note is being
      updated. This value must correspond to a valid friend in the social list.
  - name: note
    description: The new note string to associate with the specified friend. The note
      can be empty or contain up to 48 characters, as defined by the game's social
      system limitations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a Friend Note
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->UpdateFriendNote(123456, "Close ally");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear a Friend Note
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->UpdateFriendNote(789012, "");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with the social interface
    to modify friend notes. The implementation likely includes database synchronization
    and network updates to ensure all clients see the updated note.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an actual friend in
    the social list, otherwise the operation may silently fail or produce undefined
    behavior. Also, be mindful of character limits for the note string as exceeding
    them might result in truncation or rejection.
