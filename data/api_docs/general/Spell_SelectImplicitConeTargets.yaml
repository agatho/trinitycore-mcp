  signature: void Spell::SelectImplicitConeTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,
    const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType, int targetIndex, uint32 effMask)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit cone targets for spell effects based on specified parameters
  description: This method determines and selects target objects for cone-shaped spell
    effects, using the provided spell effect information and target type. It processes
    the target selection based on the effective mask and handles various target types
    including area of effect targets. The method is crucial for proper spell targeting
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine, ensuring correct target selection for
    cone-based spells.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains detailed information about the spell effect being processed,
      including effect type, radius, and other parameters that define how targets
      should be selected
  - name: targetType
    description: Specifies the target type for the spell effect, determining how targets
      are selected for cone-shaped spells including area of effect targets
  - name: targetIndex
    description: The index of the target being processed, used to determine which
      specific target from multiple targets should be selected for cone effects
  - name: effMask
    description: The effective mask that determines which spell effects are considered
      during target selection, allowing for precise control over effect processing
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic cone target selection example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitConeTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex,
      effMask);

      // This selects targets for a cone-shaped spell effect based on the provided
      parameters'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced cone target processing example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      Spell::SelectImplicitConeTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex, effMask);

      // This demonstrates how the method processes cone targets for complex spell
      effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell targeting system and should be called
    during spell processing. Implementation details include handling of different
    target types and effect masks, which can affect performance if not properly managed.
  warnings: Improper use of parameters can lead to incorrect target selection, potentially
    causing spells to miss their targets or select wrong targets. Care must be taken
    when specifying targetIndex and effMask to ensure correct targeting.
