  brief: Handles the Maelstrom Weapon ability logic for a Shaman AI.
  description: The HandleMaelstromWeapon method implements the core logic for the
    Shaman's Maelstrom Weapon spell, which is a passive ability that increases the
    damage of certain attacks when the shaman has weapon imbues active. This method
    determines whether the ability should be applied or removed based on the current
    state of the shaman's weapon imbues and combat situation. It typically checks
    if the shaman has active weapon buffs such as Flametongue, Frostbrand, or Rockbiter
    Weapon, and then applies the Maelstrom Weapon buff accordingly. The method returns
    true if the ability was successfully handled or false if it could not be processed
    due to invalid conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Maelstrom Weapon ability was successfully handled and
    applied or removed based on current conditions; otherwise, returns false if the
    ability could not be processed due to invalid state or preconditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    if (!HandleMaelstromWeapon())\n    {\n        // Handle failure case\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the Shaman AI's update cycle to maintain
    proper buff states. It relies on the shaman having access to weapon imbue abilities
    and being in a combat situation where Maelstrom Weapon would be beneficial.
