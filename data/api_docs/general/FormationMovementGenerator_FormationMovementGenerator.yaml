  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: FormationMovementGenerator
  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::FormationMovementGenerator(int * leader,
    float range, float angle, int point1, int point2)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a formation movement generator with specified leader, range,
    angle, and point parameters for creature group positioning.
  description: The FormationMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that controls how creatures in a group maintain their formation relative to a
    designated leader. This method sets up internal parameters such as the leader's
    identifier, the desired distance (range) from the leader, angular offset (angle),
    and two point identifiers used for positioning within the formation. It is typically
    used by the AI system to manage group movement behavior in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore engine. The generator ensures that creatures follow the leader while
    maintaining a consistent spatial arrangement defined by the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer identifying the creature that serves as the
      formation leader. This should reference a valid creature GUID or similar identifier
      used internally by the AI system.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value representing the desired distance from the leader
      creature. Controls how far away follower creatures should position themselves
      from the leader in the formation.
  - name: angle
    description: Floating-point value indicating the angular offset (in radians or
      degrees) from the leader's facing direction. Determines the directional orientation
      of the follower relative to the leader.
  - name: point1
    description: Integer identifier for the first point in the formation path. Used
      to define a reference position or waypoint that influences the positioning logic.
  - name: point2
    description: Integer identifier for the second point in the formation path. Often
      used alongside point1 to determine more complex formation shapes or movement
      patterns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Formation Movement Generator with Basic Parameters
    code: FormationMovementGenerator* fm = new FormationMovementGenerator(&leaderGuid,
      5.0f, 0.785f, 1001, 1002);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create Formation for a Group of Creatures Following Leader
    code: 'Creature* leader = ...; // Get reference to leader creature

      int* leaderGuid = &leader->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      FormationMovementGenerator fm(leaderGuid, 3.0f, 1.57f, 2001, 2002);

      // Apply this generator to a group of creatures for coordinated movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI subsystem in TrinityCore and relies on internal
    creature GUID management. The parameters must be carefully chosen to avoid collisions
    or unrealistic positioning in the game world. It is recommended that these values
    are validated before being passed into the constructor.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the leader pointer may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the range and angle values are within reasonable bounds
    for the intended gameplay mechanics. Using invalid point identifiers can cause
    formation logic to fail silently or behave unpredictably.
