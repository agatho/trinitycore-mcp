  brief: Updates the player's percentage modifier for healing done.
  description: The UpdateHealingDonePercentMod method recalculates and applies any
    modifiers that affect the amount of healing a player can perform. This includes
    buffs, debuffs, talents, and other game effects that modify healing output. The
    method typically updates internal statistics and ensures that the player's healing
    capabilities reflect all active modifiers. It is commonly called when modifying
    player attributes or applying temporary effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->UpdateHealingDonePercentMod();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by the game engine when healing
    modifiers change, such as after applying a buff or changing talents. Developers
    should not typically call this directly unless implementing custom healing mechanics.
