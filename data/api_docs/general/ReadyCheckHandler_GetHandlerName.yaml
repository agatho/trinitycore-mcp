  class: ReadyCheckHandler
  method: GetHandlerName
  signature: std::string ReadyCheckHandler::GetHandlerName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the ready check handler for identification purposes.
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the string identifier associated
    with this ReadyCheckHandler instance. This name is typically used internally by
    the TrinityCore framework to distinguish between different handler implementations
    or to register the handler within a system that manages various game event handlers.
    The returned string is usually constant for the lifetime of the handler object
    and represents a unique logical identifier for the ready check functionality within
    the game's architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of this ReadyCheckHandler
    instance, typically used for system registration or debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Handler Name
    code: 'ReadyCheckHandler handler;

      std::string name = handler.GetHandlerName();

      // name would contain a string like "ReadyCheckHandler" or similar identifier'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger handler pattern implementation where
    multiple handlers may exist for different game events. The returned string should
    be consistent and meaningful to avoid confusion in logs or debugging output.
