  class: FormationUtils
  method: CanFormationFitInArea
  signature: bool FormationUtils::CanFormationFitInArea(FormationType formation, uint32
    memberCount, float availableRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given formation can fit within a specified radial area
    based on member count and available radius.
  description: The CanFormationFitInArea method evaluates if a formation of a specific
    type with a given number of members can be accommodated within a circular area
    defined by the available radius. This utility is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to manage creature formations, such as grouping mobs in a tactical
    formation or ensuring that summoned creatures fit within designated areas. The
    method considers both the geometric constraints of the formation type and the
    spatial limitations imposed by the available radius. It returns true if the formation
    can be placed without exceeding the radial boundary, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: The FormationType enum value that specifies the shape and layout
      of the formation (e.g., circle, line, hexagon). This determines how members
      are positioned relative to each other.
  - name: memberCount
    description: The number of members (creatures or units) that will be part of the
      formation. This affects the total space required for the formation.
  - name: availableRadius
    description: The maximum radius in yards within which the formation must fit.
      The method checks if all formation members can be placed within this circular
      area.
  returns: Returns true if the specified formation with the given number of members
    can fit entirely within the provided available radius; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a circular formation fits in a 10-yard radius
    code: "if (FormationUtils::CanFormationFitInArea(FormationType::CIRCLE, 5, 10.0f))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with placing the formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate a hexagonal formation for a large group
    code: "bool fits = FormationUtils::CanFormationFitInArea(FormationType::HEXAGON,\
      \ 20, 25.0f);\nif (fits) {\n    // Formation can be safely placed\n} else {\n\
      \    // Adjust formation or area size\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during AI decision-making and creature spawning
    logic in TrinityCore. It assumes uniform spacing between members based on the
    formation type, but does not account for individual unit sizes or terrain obstacles.
  warnings: The method may return false even if a formation could theoretically fit
    if the internal calculation considers minimum required spacing that exceeds the
    available radius. Ensure that the member count and radius values are realistic
    for the intended use case.
