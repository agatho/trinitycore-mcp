  brief: Sets the attack swing error status for the player.
  description: This method configures the attack swing error state for a player character,
    determining whether their melee attacks will be successful or encounter specific
    errors. The method is typically used in conjunction with combat system mechanics
    to control attack outcomes and prevent invalid attacks from occurring during combat.
    It affects the player's ability to perform melee attacks and can influence the
    overall combat behavior of the character.

      or 'unable to attack'.
