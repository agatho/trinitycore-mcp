  brief: Moves a TerrainInfo object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    new instance.
  description: The TerrainInfo move constructor initializes a new TerrainInfo object
    by transferring the contents from an existing TerrainInfo object that is about
    to be destroyed. This operation is typically used in scenarios where objects need
    to be efficiently transferred between variables without performing expensive deep
    copies. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation and should
    not be used afterward. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation, this constructor is likely used when managing terrain data structures
    for map regions or zone-specific information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Construction
    code: 'TerrainInfo sourceTerrain;

      // ... populate sourceTerrain with data ...

      TerrainInfo newTerrain = std::move(sourceTerrain);

      // sourceTerrain is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // newTerrain contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a move operation, which typically involves transferring
    pointers or handles rather than copying large data structures. It's important
    to understand that after moving, the source object should not be accessed as its
    state is undefined but valid.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are invalidated immediately
    after the move.
