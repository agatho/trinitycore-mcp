  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: RecordPathLearned
  signature: void FlightMasterManager::RecordPathLearned(uint32 nodeId)
documentation:
  brief: Records that a player has learned a flight path node.
  description: The RecordPathLearned method is used to mark a specific flight master
    node as learned by the player. This typically occurs when a player successfully
    learns a new flight path from a Flight Master NPC. The method updates internal
    tracking structures within the FlightMasterManager to reflect that the player
    has acquired knowledge of this particular node, which may affect subsequent flight
    path availability or UI display. It is generally called during quest completion
    or flight master interaction events.
  parameters:
  - name: nodeId
    description: The unique identifier of the flight path node that the player has
      learned. This ID corresponds to a specific waypoint in the flight master's path
      table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Flight Path Node
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fm = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayer(playerGuid)->GetFlightMasterManager();

      fm->RecordPathLearned(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates the player's flight path database or achievement
    tracking system. It should only be called after verifying that the player has
    actually learned the node, typically through quest completion or NPC interaction.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in incorrect
    flight path availability or UI state, potentially confusing players about their
    available routes.
