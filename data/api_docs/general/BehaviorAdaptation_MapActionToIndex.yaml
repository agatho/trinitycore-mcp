documentation:
  brief: Maps an action name string to its corresponding index value within the BehaviorAdaptation
    system.
  description: The MapActionToIndex method translates a given action name, represented
    as a std::string, into a unique uint32_t index that is used internally by the
    BehaviorAdaptation class for efficient lookup and management of behavior actions.
    This method is typically employed in AI decision-making systems where actions
    need to be quickly referenced by their string identifiers. The mapping is usually
    pre-defined and may involve internal data structures such as hash tables or lookup
    arrays for performance optimization. It's important to note that this method assumes
    the action name exists within the known set of behaviors; attempting to map an
    unknown action name may result in undefined behavior or a default return value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32_t index corresponding to the provided action name. If
    the action name is not recognized, the method may return a default value (such
    as 0) or trigger an assertion/error depending on implementation details. The returned
    index can be used to access behavior-related data structures or perform lookups
    within the BehaviorAdaptation system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t index = behaviorAdaptation.MapActionToIndex(\"Attack\");\n// Returns\
      \ the index for the 'Attack' action, e.g., 1\nif (index != 0) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with using the index to access behavior data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a hash map or similar fast lookup
    structure for performance. It's recommended to cache the result of this mapping
    if the same action name is used multiple times, as repeated lookups may be costly.
    The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that all action names passed to this method are valid and registered
    within the BehaviorAdaptation system. Passing invalid or unregistered action names
    may lead to incorrect behavior or errors depending on how the internal mapping
    is implemented.
