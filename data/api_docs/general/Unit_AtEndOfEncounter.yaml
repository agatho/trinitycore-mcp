    It handles cleanup and state management for the unit's encounter-related activities,

  notes: Implementation details may vary based on how the encounter system is structured
    in TrinityCore. This method likely involves updating internal flags or state variables
    related to encounter completion.

    concluded; calling it prematurely could lead to inconsistent game state.
