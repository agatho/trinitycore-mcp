  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: SetStallThreshold
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::SetStallThreshold(uint32 milliseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the stall threshold value in milliseconds for the bot health check system.
  description: The SetStallThreshold method configures the maximum allowable delay
    in milliseconds before a bot's health check is considered stalled. This threshold
    determines how long the system will wait for a response from a bot's health monitoring
    process before triggering a stall detection event. The value is typically used
    in conjunction with other bot management systems to ensure timely detection of
    unhealthy or unresponsive bots. This method directly affects the responsiveness
    and reliability of the bot health monitoring subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: milliseconds
    description: The stall threshold value in milliseconds. Valid values are positive
      integers representing time duration. Typical values range from 1000 (1 second)
      to 30000 (30 seconds), though exact ranges depend on system configuration and
      game mechanics requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotHealthCheck botCheck;

      botCheck.SetStallThreshold(5000); // Set stall threshold to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuration with Dynamic Value
    code: 'uint32 timeout = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_BOT_HEALTH_STALL_TIMEOUT);

      botCheck.SetStallThreshold(timeout); // Configure based on world settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or configuration
    loading. The stall threshold value directly impacts how quickly the system detects
    unresponsive bots, with lower values providing more immediate detection but potentially
    higher false positives.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause false stall detections due to normal
    network latency or processing delays. Setting it too high may delay detection
    of truly stalled bots, potentially leading to resource waste.
