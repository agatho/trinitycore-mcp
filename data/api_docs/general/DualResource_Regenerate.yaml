  class: DualResource
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void DualResource::Regenerate(uint32 deltaMs, bool inCombat)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dual resource values of a unit based on elapsed time and combat
    state.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for updating the dual resource
    values (such as energy, rage, or focus) of a unit over time. It takes into account
    the delta time since last update and whether the unit is currently in combat to
    determine how much resource should be regenerated. This method is typically called
    by the game loop or internal systems to maintain dynamic resource states for player
    characters and NPCs. The regeneration rate may vary depending on the unit's class,
    talents, and current state (e.g., in combat vs. out of combat).
  parameters:
  - name: deltaMs
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last resource regeneration
      update. This value determines how much time has passed for which resources should
      be regenerated.
  - name: inCombat
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the unit is currently in combat.
      This affects the regeneration rate, as units typically regenerate resources
      faster or slower depending on their combat state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 deltaTime = GetDeltaTime();\n    player->GetDualResource()->Regenerate(deltaTime,\
      \ player->IsInCombat());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual resource regeneration call
    code: "void OnPlayerUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (player->IsAlive())\n    {\n\
      \        player->GetDualResource()->Regenerate(diff, player->IsInCombat());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core game engine during
    update cycles. Developers should not need to call this directly unless implementing
    custom resource logic or debugging. The actual regeneration calculations are handled
    internally based on class-specific rules and modifiers.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper context may lead to incorrect
    resource states. Ensure that deltaMs accurately reflects real time passage and
    inCombat reflects the current unit state to avoid unexpected behavior.
