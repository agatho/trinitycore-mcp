documentation:
  brief: Stops the current movement of a unit controlled by the MovementArbiter.
  description: The StopMovement method halts any ongoing movement for the unit associated
    with this MovementArbiter. It interrupts the current pathing behavior and resets
    the movement state, effectively stopping all motion immediately. This method is
    typically used when a unit needs to cease movement regardless of its current destination
    or movement status. The operation is immediate and does not wait for the unit
    to reach a specific point before stopping.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementArbiter* arbiter = player->GetMotionMaster();

      arbiter->StopMovement();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can abruptly interrupt movement
    behaviors that may have side effects, such as combat positioning or scripted sequences.
    It is recommended to check the current movement state before calling this method
    if precise control over movement flow is required.
