  signature: void WorldSession::HandleReadyCheckResponseOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::ReadyCheckResponseClient
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a player's response to a party ready check initiated by the party
    leader.
  description: The HandleReadyCheckResponseOpcode method handles the client-side response
    to a party ready check request. When a party leader initiates a ready check, all
    party members receive a notification prompting them to respond. This method processes
    the player's response (either ready or not ready) and updates the party's ready
    status accordingly. The method is part of the WorldSession class and is invoked
    when the client sends a ReadyCheckResponseClient packet. It ensures that the party
    leader can determine whether all members are prepared for an activity such as
    entering a dungeon or starting a quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Party Context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleReadyCheckResponseOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::ReadyCheckResponseClient&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup())\n        {\n            group->ReadyCheckResponse(player,\
      \ packet.Ready);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop when a packet is
    received. It assumes that the player is part of a group and that the group leader
    has initiated a ready check. The implementation relies on the party system's internal
    tracking of ready states.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode may result in incorrect party ready status
    updates, potentially causing issues with dungeon entry or quest progression. Ensure
    that only valid party members can respond to ready checks.
