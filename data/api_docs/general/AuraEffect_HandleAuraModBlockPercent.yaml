  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraModBlockPercent
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModBlockPercent(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the percentage chance to block attacks for the affected unit.
  description: The HandleAuraModBlockPercent method adjusts the block chance percentage
    of an aura application. This method is invoked during aura application or removal
    to modify the target's ability to block incoming melee attacks. The change is
    applied based on the aura's effect value and the specified mode (application or
    removal). It directly influences combat mechanics by altering how often a unit
    can successfully block damage from physical attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter determines which unit is affected
      and provides context for the block percentage modification.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies whether the aura is being applied (1) or removed (0). This
      controls the direction of the block chance adjustment, either increasing or
      decreasing the percentage based on the aura's effect value.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). When true, the block percentage is increased; when false, it is decreased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Block Chance Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      effect->HandleAuraModBlockPercent(app, 1, true); // Apply block chance increase'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Block Chance Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      effect->HandleAuraModBlockPercent(app, 0, false); // Remove block chance increase'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the combat system's block mechanics. The actual percentage change depends
    on the aura's effect value and may be influenced by other factors such as weapon
    type or stance.
