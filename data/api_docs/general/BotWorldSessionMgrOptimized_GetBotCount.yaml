  method: GetBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::GetBotCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active bot sessions managed by the optimized world
    session manager.
  description: The GetBotCount method retrieves the number of currently active bot
    sessions within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance. This method is typically
    used to monitor or manage the number of bots in a World of Warcraft server environment,
    particularly in systems that utilize TrinityCore's bot framework. The count includes
    all bot sessions that are currently connected and active, excluding any inactive
    or disconnected sessions. This information can be useful for load balancing, resource
    allocation, or administrative purposes when managing large numbers of automated
    player characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bot sessions managed
    by this instance. Returns zero if no bots are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Count
    code: 'uint32 botCount = sBotWorldSessionMgr->GetBotCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Active bot count: %u", botCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bot Count for Resource Management
    code: "uint32 currentBots = sBotWorldSessionMgr->GetBotCount();\nif (currentBots\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"bot\", \"High bot count detected: %u\", currentBots);\n\
      \    // Implement throttling or alerting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter that
    is maintained by the session manager. It's designed to be efficient and thread-safe
    for frequent calls. The returned count may not include bots that are in transition
    states (connecting, disconnecting) but should reflect fully established sessions.
  warnings: The bot count returned by this method may not immediately reflect changes
    if there are concurrent operations modifying the session list. For real-time accuracy
    in high-concurrency scenarios, consider using appropriate locking mechanisms or
    polling intervals.
