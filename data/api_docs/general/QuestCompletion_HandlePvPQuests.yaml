documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles PvP quest completion for a player in a battleground.
  description: The HandlePvPQuests method is responsible for managing the completion
    of PvP-related quests for a specified player within the context of a battleground.
    This method likely checks if the player has met the necessary conditions to complete
    any active PvP quests, updates quest progress, and potentially rewards the player
    with items, experience, or other in-game benefits. It operates within the TrinityCore
    framework and is typically invoked during battleground events or when a player's
    PvP activity concludes. The method takes into account the battleground ID to ensure
    proper quest handling specific to that environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose PvP quests
      are being processed. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: battlegroundId
    description: Unique identifier for the battleground where the quest completion
      is taking place. Used to determine applicable PvP quests and rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Context
    code: "void MyBattlegroundHandler::OnPlayerWon(Player* player, uint32 bgId)\n\
      {\n    QuestCompletion questComp;\n    questComp.HandlePvPQuests(player, bgId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom PvP Logic
    code: "void CustomPvPSystem::CompletePlayerQuests(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ currentBgId = player->GetBattlegroundId();\n    if (currentBgId > 0)\n   \
      \ {\n        QuestCompletion questComp;\n        questComp.HandlePvPQuests(player,\
      \ currentBgId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest management system and may interact
    with the player's quest log, achievement tracking, and reward distribution mechanisms.
    It assumes that the player is currently engaged in or has recently finished a
    battleground activity. Developers should ensure proper synchronization when calling
    this method from different threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. The battlegroundId must correspond to an active
    battleground; otherwise, quest completion logic may not behave as expected.
