  method: GetFragmentCount
  signature: uint32 VengeanceSoulFragmentManager::GetFragmentCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of vengeance soul fragments managed by the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager.
  description: The GetFragmentCount method returns the number of vengeance soul fragments
    currently tracked or managed by the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager instance. This
    method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's Vengeance talent
    system, where players can collect soul fragments as part of their combat progression.
    The returned count represents how many such fragments are available for use or
    consumption within the system. The method performs no side effects and simply
    provides a read-only view of the internal fragment inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of vengeance soul fragments
    currently managed by this VengeanceSoulFragmentManager instance. Returns zero
    if no fragments are present or if the manager is uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 fragmentCount = vengeanceSoulFragmentManager->GetFragmentCount();\n\
      if (fragmentCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with fragment-based actions\n    printf(\"\
      Found %u vengeance soul fragments\\n\", fragmentCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Fragment Availability Before Action
    code: "VengeanceSoulFragmentManager* manager = player->GetVengeanceSoulFragmentManager();\n\
      if (manager && manager->GetFragmentCount() >= 5)\n{\n    // Use 5 fragments\
      \ for a powerful ability\n    player->UseVengeanceFragments(5);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Notify player they don't have enough fragments\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough vengeance soul fragments.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context without risk
    of data corruption. It does not modify the internal state of the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager,
    making it safe for frequent calls in performance-critical code paths such as combat
    or UI updates.
  warnings: While this method itself is safe to call, developers should ensure that
    the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager instance being queried is valid and initialized
    before calling GetFragmentCount. Calling this on a null pointer will result in
    undefined behavior.
