documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and manages the rogue's stealth state based on combat conditions
    and abilities.
  description: The ConsiderStealth method in the RogueAI class determines whether
    the rogue should enter or maintain stealth mode. It evaluates various factors
    such as player health, target proximity, available stealth abilities, and combat
    situation to decide if stealth is beneficial or necessary. This method typically
    integrates with the AI's decision-making process to optimize the rogue's tactical
    positioning and damage output by leveraging stealth mechanics. The method does
    not directly activate stealth but rather makes decisions that influence when stealth
    should be used.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    ConsiderStealth();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the rogue's AI behavior system and is typically called
    during the AI update cycle. It relies on internal state tracking of the rogue's
    stealth abilities, health status, and combat context to make decisions.
