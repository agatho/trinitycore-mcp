  brief: Asynchronously loads permission data for the session's associated player
    account
  description: The LoadPermissionsAsync method initiates an asynchronous operation
    to retrieve and cache permission levels and privileges associated with the currently
    logged-in player's account. This method is typically invoked during the login
    process or when access to restricted game features is required. It performs database
    queries to fetch role-based permissions, command access levels, and other privilege-related
    data specific to the session's account. The asynchronous nature allows the game
    server to continue processing other requests while the permission data is being
    fetched from the database. This method ensures that player access control is properly
    initialized before allowing gameplay interactions that require permission checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful initiation of the asynchronous loading process,
    or a non-zero error code if the operation fails to start. A return value of 0
    indicates that the async operation was queued successfully, while non-zero values
    typically indicate database connection issues or invalid session state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in login flow
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nint result = session->LoadPermissionsAsync();\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Permission loading initiated successfully\n    //\
      \ Proceed with further login steps\n} else {\n    // Handle error - permission\
      \ loading failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load permissions for session\
      \ %u\", session->GetAccountId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking in its initiation phase, meaning
    it returns quickly after queuing the async operation. The actual permission data
    loading occurs in a background thread or through asynchronous I/O operations.
    Developers should ensure that any code relying on permissions waits for the async
    operation to complete before performing permission-sensitive actions. The method
    may internally use TrinityCore's async database framework which handles connection
    pooling and concurrent query execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid session or account context may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. The method should only be called after a successful
    player login and session establishment. Additionally, since this is an asynchronous
    operation, immediate permission checks after calling this method might fail if
    the data hasn't been fully loaded yet.
