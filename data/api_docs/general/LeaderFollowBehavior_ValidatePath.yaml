  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: ValidatePath
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::ValidatePath(const int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given path ID is valid for leader-follow behavior in
    the AI system.
  description: The ValidatePath method checks if a specified path ID is valid and
    can be used by the LeaderFollowBehavior AI module. This validation ensures that
    the path exists within the AI's pathfinding system and is suitable for use in
    leader-follow mechanics. The method typically performs checks such as verifying
    that the path ID corresponds to an existing path in the navigation mesh, ensuring
    the path is not corrupted or expired, and confirming that the path meets the requirements
    for leader-follow behavior. This validation is crucial before attempting to execute
    any movement commands based on the path.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: The path ID to validate. This should be a non-negative integer representing
      a valid path in the AI system's navigation mesh.
  returns: Returns true if the path ID is valid and can be used for leader-follow
    behavior, false otherwise. The method returns false if the path ID is invalid,
    does not exist, or cannot be used with the current AI context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Validation
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->ValidatePath(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with leader-follow\
      \ movement using path 12345\n    leaderFollowBehavior->SetCurrentPath(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid path case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid path\
      \ ID: %d\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Validation in Movement Logic
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (leaderFollowBehavior && leaderFollowBehavior->ValidatePath(currentPathID))\
      \ {\n            // Execute movement using validated path\n            return\
      \ leaderFollowBehavior->MoveAlongPath(currentPathID);\n        }\n        //\
      \ Fallback or error handling\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the AI's pathfinding
    database and may cache validation results for performance. The path ID parameter
    should be obtained from valid path generation or retrieval methods within the
    AI system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid path ID may result in undefined behavior
    or failed movement operations. Ensure that all path IDs are properly validated
    before being passed to this method.
