documentation:
  brief: Determines whether current memory usage is within acceptable thresholds for
    bot operation.
  description: The IsMemoryUsageAcceptable method evaluates the current system memory
    consumption and compares it against predefined thresholds to determine if the
    bot can continue operating without risking performance degradation or system instability.
    This method is typically used by the bot management system to make decisions about
    resource allocation, task scheduling, and operational limits. The check considers
    both absolute memory usage values and memory pressure indicators to provide a
    comprehensive assessment of system health. It is designed to prevent bots from
    consuming excessive resources that could impact server performance or cause system
    crashes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current memory usage is within acceptable limits, allowing
    the bot to continue normal operations; returns false if memory usage exceeds thresholds,
    indicating potential resource constraints that may require mitigation actions
    such as pausing non-critical tasks or reducing resource consumption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (bot->GetResourceMonitor()->IsMemoryUsageAcceptable()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal bot operations\n    bot->PerformAction();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ memory pressure situation\n    bot->SuspendNonEssentialTasks();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight check of current memory metrics and should
    not introduce significant performance overhead. The threshold values for acceptable
    memory usage are configurable through TrinityCore's bot management settings and
    may vary based on server configuration and available system resources.
