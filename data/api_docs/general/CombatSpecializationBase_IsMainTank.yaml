documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat specialization represents the main tank role.
  description: The IsMainTank method checks if the current combat specialization is
    designated as the primary tank specialization for a player or unit. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's combat mechanics to determine appropriate behavior
    for tanking roles, such as which abilities should be prioritized or how threat
    generation should be handled. The method returns true if the specialization is
    specifically configured as a main tank specialization, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is particularly relevant for classes that can fulfill multiple roles,
    where one specialization is explicitly marked as the primary tanking specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization is classified as a main tank
    role; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsMainTank()) {\n    // Apply main\
      \ tank specific logic\n    player->SetThreatMultiplier(1.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Behavior
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec->IsMainTank()) {\n    // Main tank abilities\n    player->LearnSpell(148932);\
      \ // Improved Blood Presence\n} else {\n    // Non-tank specialization\n   \
      \ player->LearnSpell(148933); // Alternative talent\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal specialization flags that are set during the
    game's initialization or when a player changes their specialization. The result
    is cached and should not change during a single combat encounter unless the specialization
    itself is modified.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for critical combat decisions without verifying
    the current combat state, as specializations can be changed mid-combat in some
    scenarios.
