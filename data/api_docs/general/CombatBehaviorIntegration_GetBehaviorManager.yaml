  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetBehaviorManager
  signature: AdaptiveBehaviorManager * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetBehaviorManager()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the adaptive behavior manager instance associated with the combat
    behavior integration.
  description: The GetBehaviorManager method returns a pointer to the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    object that controls the dynamic behavioral logic for combat-related AI operations
    within the TrinityCore framework. This manager is responsible for handling adaptive
    decision-making processes during combat, including threat assessment, ability
    selection, and tactical adjustments based on encounter conditions. The returned
    pointer should be used carefully as it represents a singleton instance managed
    by the integration system, and improper handling may lead to memory or logic corruption.
    This method does not perform any initialization or creation of the manager; it
    simply retrieves an already established instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance if successfully initialized,
    or nullptr if the manager has not been set up yet or is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = combatIntegration->GetBehaviorManager();\n\
      if (behaviorMgr != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the behavior manager for AI decisions\n\
      \    behaviorMgr->UpdateCombatState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* integration = GetCombatBehaviorIntegration();\n\
      AdaptiveBehaviorManager* mgr = integration->GetBehaviorManager();\nif (mgr &&\
      \ mgr->IsEnabled())\n{\n    mgr->ExecuteNextAction();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Fallback\
      \ behavior when manager is not ready\n    DefaultCombatAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AdaptiveBehaviorManager returned by this method is typically initialized
    during the object's setup phase and may be shared across multiple combat entities.
    Ensure thread safety if accessing from concurrent contexts, as the manager might
    not be thread-safe. The pointer should never be deleted or freed directly by the
    caller.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer is always valid; always check
    for nullptr before using it. Improper use of the behavior manager can cause unexpected
    AI behavior or crashes in combat scenarios. Avoid storing references to the manager
    beyond its expected lifetime.
