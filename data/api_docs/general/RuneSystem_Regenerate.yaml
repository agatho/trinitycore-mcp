documentation:
  brief: Regenerates rune energy for the player based on elapsed time.
  description: The Regenerate method updates the player's rune system by restoring
    rune energy over time. This method is typically called during game ticks or update
    cycles to simulate the natural regeneration of runes, which are used by Death
    Knights in World of Warcraft. It processes the time difference (diff) to determine
    how much rune energy should be restored, ensuring that runes do not exceed their
    maximum capacity. The method directly modifies internal rune state variables and
    may trigger visual updates or notifications to the player when runes become available.

  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();

      uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      runeSys->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly, typically every game tick or at
    fixed intervals, to maintain accurate rune regeneration. The internal implementation
    likely uses a time-based calculation that accounts for rune cooldowns and maximum
    energy thresholds.
