  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: GetEstimatedBotsThisTick
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityManager::GetEstimatedBotsThisTick(uint32 currentTick)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the estimated number of bots that will be processed
    in the current tick.
  description: The GetEstimatedBotsThisTick method is used to determine how many bot
    operations are expected to be executed during the current game tick. This estimation
    helps with resource management, load balancing, and performance optimization within
    the TrinityCore bot system. The method takes into account various factors such
    as active bots, their priorities, and system constraints to provide an accurate
    prediction of bot workload for the upcoming tick cycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the estimated number of bots that will
    be processed in the current tick. This value indicates the expected workload and
    can be used by other systems to adjust their behavior accordingly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 estimatedBots = botPriorityManager->GetEstimatedBotsThisTick();\n\
      if (estimatedBots > 100)\n{\n    // Adjust bot processing rate or queue\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "uint32 currentEstimate = botPriorityManager->GetEstimatedBotsThisTick();\n\
      uint32 previousEstimate = lastTickBotCount;\nfloat loadRatio = (float)currentEstimate\
      \ / (float)previousEstimate;\nif (loadRatio > 1.5f)\n{\n    // Log high load\
      \ warning\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"High bot load detected: %u bots\
      \ this tick\", currentEstimate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during tick processing to help determine
    how many bots can be safely processed without overloading the system. The estimation
    may vary based on dynamic factors such as server load, bot activity levels, and
    configuration settings.
