  class: Player
  method: RemoveAtLoginFlag
  signature: void Player::RemoveAtLoginFlag(AtLoginFlags flags, bool persist)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified at-login flags from the player's character data.
  description: This method removes one or more at-login flags from a player's character
    data, allowing them to be modified without being persisted across login. The flags
    are removed from the player's AtLoginFlags bitmask, which controls various character
    state changes that occur upon login. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with AddAtLoginFlag to modify player behavior before logout or character relogin.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The specific at-login flag(s) to remove from the player's character
      data. Valid values include AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_NONE, AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RENAME,
      AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RESET_SPELLS, AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RESET_Talents, AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_FIRST_LOGIN,
      and others. Multiple flags can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  - name: persist
    description: Determines whether the flag removal should persist across character
      relogin. If true, the flag removal will be permanent; if false, it will only
      affect the current session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Rename Flag
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->RemoveAtLoginFlag(AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RENAME, true);

      // Player will no longer be flagged for rename upon next login'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Multiple Flags
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->RemoveAtLoginFlag(AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RESET_SPELLS | AtLoginFlags::AT_LOGIN_RESET_Talents,
      false);

      // Player will not reset spells or talents upon next login'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's character data stored in the database.
    It should be used carefully as it affects how the character behaves upon relogin.
    The method is typically called during player logout or before character relogin
    to ensure proper flag handling.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior during character
    relogin, especially if flags are removed without proper consideration of their
    effects on gameplay mechanics. It's important to understand that removing flags
    does not immediately affect the player's current state but rather modifies future
    login behavior.
