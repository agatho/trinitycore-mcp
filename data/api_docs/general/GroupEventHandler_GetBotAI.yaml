  signature: BotAI * GroupEventHandler::GetBotAI() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the BotAI instance associated with the group event handler.
  description: The GetBotAI method returns a pointer to the BotAI object that is currently
    associated with this GroupEventHandler. This method is typically used within the
    context of TrinityCore's bot AI system to access or interact with the bot's behavior
    logic. The returned pointer may be null if no bot AI instance has been initialized
    for this group event handler, which can happen in scenarios where bots are not
    active or have not yet been assigned to the group. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI object if one is associated with this GroupEventHandler;
    otherwise, returns nullptr if no bot AI instance exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotAI* botAI = groupEventHandler->GetBotAI();\nif (botAI != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the bot AI instance\n    botAI->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid BotAI Instance
    code: "GroupEventHandler* handler = GetGroupEventHandler();\nBotAI* ai = handler->GetBotAI();\n\
      if (ai && ai->IsEnabled())\n{\n    // Perform bot AI operations\n    ai->ExecuteNextAction();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no valid bot AI is present\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No active bot AI found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupEventHandler has been properly initialized
    with a BotAI instance. The returned BotAI pointer should not be deleted or managed
    by the caller, as it is owned by the GroupEventHandler. If the method is called
    on an uninitialized handler, it will return nullptr without causing undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer without checking for
    null, as doing so may lead to segmentation faults if no bot AI has been assigned.
    Also, ensure that the GroupEventHandler object remains valid throughout the lifetime
    of the BotAI pointer to prevent dangling pointer issues.
