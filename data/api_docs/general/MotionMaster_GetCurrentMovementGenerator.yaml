  class: MotionMaster
  method: GetCurrentMovementGenerator
  signature: MovementGenerator * MotionMaster::GetCurrentMovementGenerator(MovementSlot
    slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current movement generator for the specified movement slot.
  description: This method retrieves the active movement generator assigned to a specific
    movement slot within the MotionMaster class. It is commonly used to determine
    the current behavior or path of a creature or player in the game world, particularly
    when dealing with movement patterns and navigation. The method allows developers
    to access and inspect the active movement generator without modifying it, making
    it useful for debugging, monitoring, or implementing custom behaviors based on
    current movement states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the MovementGenerator object currently assigned to
    the specified movement slot. If no movement generator is assigned to that slot,
    it returns nullptr. The returned pointer should be treated as const and not modified
    directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = motionMaster->GetCurrentMovementGenerator(MovementSlot::IDLE);\n\
      if (mg)\n{\n    // Process the movement generator\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = motionMaster->GetCurrentMovementGenerator(MovementSlot::FOLLOW);\n\
      if (mg && mg->GetMovementType() == MovementType::FOLLOW)\n{\n    // Handle follow\
      \ movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other motion-related APIs
    to monitor or modify movement behavior. It should be used carefully as the returned
    pointer may become invalid if the movement generator changes or is removed from
    the slot.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as accessing an invalid pointer can
    lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the movement slot exists
    before calling this method.
