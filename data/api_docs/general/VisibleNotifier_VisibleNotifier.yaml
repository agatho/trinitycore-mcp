  brief: Moves a VisibleNotifier object, transferring its resources to a new instance.
  description: The VisibleNotifier move constructor initializes a new VisibleNotifier
    object by transferring the resources from an existing rvalue reference. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where objects need to be efficiently moved rather
    than copied, particularly when dealing with containers or when returning objects
    from functions. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    constructor supports efficient management of visibility data for game entities
    such as players and creatures, ensuring that visibility updates are handled without
    unnecessary copying overhead.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a VisibleNotifier
    code: 'VisibleNotifier notifier1;

      // ... initialize notifier1 ...

      VisibleNotifier notifier2 = std::move(notifier1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, which means it's designed to efficiently transfer
    ownership of resources from one object to another. It should only be called with
    rvalue expressions or objects explicitly marked for moving using std::move().
    The original object becomes invalid after the move and should not be used.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after being moved from. This
    constructor does not perform any deep copying of data structures, so care must
    be taken with shared or referenced resources.
