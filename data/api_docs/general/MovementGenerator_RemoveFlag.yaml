  class: MovementGenerator
  method: RemoveFlag
  signature: void MovementGenerator::RemoveFlag(const uint16 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified flag from the movement generator's flag set.
  description: The RemoveFlag method is used to clear or disable a specific flag within
    the MovementGenerator class. This method operates on a bitmask that represents
    various movement-related states or behaviors. By removing a flag, the movement
    generator can transition between different movement modes or disable certain movement
    characteristics. The method typically works in conjunction with other flag manipulation
    methods like AddFlag and HasFlag to manage the movement state of units in the
    game world. This functionality is essential for controlling how creatures or players
    move, including handling pathfinding, movement restrictions, and special movement
    behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The flag value to be removed from the movement generator's internal
      flag set. This should be a valid flag constant defined within the MovementGenerator
      class or related movement enums. The flag is typically represented as a bit
      in a bitmask.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a movement flag from a creature
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nMovementGenerator* movementGen = creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (movementGen)\n{\n    movementGen->RemoveFlag(MOVEFLAG_FLYING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing multiple flags in sequence
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (mg)\n{\n    mg->RemoveFlag(MOVEFLAG_WALKING);\n    mg->RemoveFlag(MOVEFLAG_RUN);\n\
      \    mg->RemoveFlag(MOVEFLAG_SWIMMING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the MovementGenerator directly.
    It's important to understand that flag manipulation affects movement behavior
    immediately, so changes should be made carefully during appropriate game states.
    The implementation likely uses bitwise operations for efficient flag management.
  warnings: Removing flags without proper consideration may cause unexpected movement
    behavior or break existing movement logic. Always verify that removing a specific
    flag won't conflict with other movement systems or cause unit to become stuck
    in an invalid state.
