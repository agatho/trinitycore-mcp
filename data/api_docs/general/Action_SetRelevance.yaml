  class: Action
  method: SetRelevance
  signature: void Action::SetRelevance(float relevance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the relevance value for this action, determining its priority in AI
    decision-making.
  description: The SetRelevance method assigns a relevance score to an Action object,
    which is used by the AI system to determine the priority and likelihood of executing
    that action. This score typically ranges from 0.0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (highly
    relevant), though values outside this range may be accepted depending on implementation.
    The relevance value influences how often or under what conditions an action will
    be considered during AI evaluation cycles. This method is commonly used in custom
    AI behaviors where actions need to be weighted based on situational context, such
    as threat level, distance to target, or available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: relevance
    description: A floating-point value representing the relevance of this action.
      Values typically range from 0.0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (highly relevant), but
      may accept other numeric values depending on AI implementation.
  returns: null

  - title: Setting Action Relevance in Custom AI
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Create a new action\n        Action* attackAction\
      \ = new Action();\n        \n        // Set relevance based on distance to target\n\
      \        float distance = me->GetDistance(target);\n        float relevance\
      \ = 1.0f - (distance / 50.0f); // Closer = more relevant\n        attackAction->SetRelevance(relevance);\n\
      \        \n        // Add action to AI decision tree\n        AddAction(attackAction);\n\
      \    }\n};"

  - title: Dynamic Relevance Adjustment Based on Combat State
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override {\n    if (me->GetVictim()) {\n   \
      \     float threatLevel = me->GetThreatManager().GetThreat(me->GetVictim());\n\
      \        float relevance = threatLevel > 1000.0f ? 1.0f : 0.5f;\n        \n\
      \        // Adjust relevance of attack action\n        if (attackAction) {\n\
      \            attackAction->SetRelevance(relevance);\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: The relevance value is typically used in conjunction with other AI decision-making
    components such as action weights, cooldowns, and target priorities. It's important
    to note that setting a relevance of 0.0 does not necessarily prevent execution;
    it simply indicates low priority. The actual behavior depends on how the AI system
    interprets and uses these relevance scores.
  warnings: Setting extremely high or low relevance values (e.g., > 1000.0 or < -1000.0)
    may cause unexpected behavior in some AI implementations. Ensure that relevance
    values are within expected ranges for your specific AI framework to avoid unintended
    consequences.
