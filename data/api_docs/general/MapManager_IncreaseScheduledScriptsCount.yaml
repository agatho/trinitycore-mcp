documentation:
  brief: Increments the count of scheduled scripts within the map manager.
  description: The IncreaseScheduledScriptsCount method is used to increment an internal
    counter that tracks the number of scheduled scripts currently active or pending
    execution within the MapManager. This method is typically invoked when a new script
    is added to the schedule, ensuring proper tracking and management of script execution.
    The counter may be used for debugging, performance monitoring, or to control script
    execution limits. This method does not take any parameters and performs no direct
    operations beyond incrementing the counter.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MapManager* mapMgr = sMapMgr;

      mapMgr->IncreaseScheduledScriptsCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of internal script management and may be called
    automatically by the core when scripts are scheduled. It's important to understand
    that this is an internal counter and not directly exposed to public APIs. Thread
    safety should be considered if multiple threads are scheduling scripts concurrently.
