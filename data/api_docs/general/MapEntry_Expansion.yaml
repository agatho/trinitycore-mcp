documentation:
  brief: Returns the expansion ID associated with the map entry.
  description: The Expansion method retrieves the expansion identifier that defines
    which World of Warcraft expansion the map belongs to. This value is used internally
    by TrinityCore to determine compatibility, content availability, and version-specific
    mechanics for different map areas. The returned value typically corresponds to
    expansion constants such as 0 for Vanilla, 1 for The Burning Crusade, 2 for Wrath
    of the Lich King, etc. This method is commonly used in map-related logic, quest
    systems, and content management to ensure proper game behavior based on the expansion
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the expansion ID associated with this map entry.
    Common values include 0 for Classic/Original, 1 for The Burning Crusade, 2 for
    Wrath of the Lich King, and so forth depending on the game's expansion releases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Map Expansion
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(0);\nuint8 expansion = entry->Expansion();\n\
      if (expansion == 0)\n{\n    // Handle Classic expansion content\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Expansion in Quest Logic
    code: "void CheckMapExpansion(uint32 mapId)\n{\n    MapEntry const* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\n\
      \    if (!entry)\n        return;\n\n    uint8 expansion = entry->Expansion();\n\
      \    // Only allow quests from certain expansions\n    if (expansion >= 2) //\
      \ Wrath of the Lich King or later\n    {\n        // Enable WotLK content\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly accesses a cached field in the
    MapEntry structure. It's safe to call from any thread context where the MapEntry
    object is valid. The expansion ID values are defined by the game client and server,
    so developers should not assume arbitrary numeric values but instead rely on the
    official expansion constants.
  warnings: Ensure that the MapEntry pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. This method does not perform any validation or error
    checking on the underlying data, so calling it on an invalid entry may return
    unexpected results.
