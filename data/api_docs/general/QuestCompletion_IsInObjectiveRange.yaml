documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is within the required range to complete a quest objective
  description: The IsInObjectiveRange method determines whether a given player is
    positioned within the acceptable distance to interact with or complete a specific
    quest objective. This function evaluates the spatial relationship between the
    player's current location and the objective's required range, which may vary depending
    on the type of quest objective (e.g., talking to an NPC, collecting items, or
    interacting with game objects). The method is typically used by quest completion
    logic to validate whether a player has approached the necessary location to progress
    through a quest. It considers both the player's physical position and the objective's
    defined range parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose position
      is being checked against the quest objective
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective, including its required range and location
      parameters
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the defined range of the quest objective,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can interact with or complete
    the specified objective based on their current position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is in range
    code: "if (questCompletion->IsInObjectiveRange(player, questObjective)) {\n  \
      \  // Player is in range, proceed with objective completion\n    CompleteQuestObjective(player,\
      \ questObjective);\n} else {\n    // Player needs to move closer\n    SendErrorMessage(player,\
      \ \"You are too far away from the objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a quest validation loop
    code: "for (auto& objective : questData.GetObjectives()) {\n    if (!IsInObjectiveRange(player,\
      \ objective)) {\n        // Mark this objective as incomplete\n        objective.SetCompleted(false);\n\
      \        continue;\n    }\n    // Player is in range, mark as complete\n   \
      \ objective.SetCompleted(true);\n}\n// Proceed with quest advancement logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations using the player's current
    coordinates and the objective's defined position. It may account for different
    types of objectives such as NPCs, game objects, or item collection points, each
    potentially having unique range requirements. The implementation might use standard
    Euclidean distance calculations or more complex spatial checks depending on the
    specific objective type.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and objective data are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Be aware that position-based checks can be
    affected by terrain, collision detection, and server-side lag. In some cases,
    additional conditions beyond range might need to be checked for full objective
    validation.
