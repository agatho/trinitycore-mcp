  method: operator=
  signature: SpawnedPoolData & SpawnedPoolData::operator=(SpawnedPoolData && right)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another SpawnedPoolData object to this instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of a SpawnedPoolData
    object, transferring all resources from the right-hand side object to the current
    object. This is an efficient operation that avoids unnecessary copying of data.
    The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified state. This method
    is typically used when assigning one SpawnedPoolData instance to another, particularly
    in scenarios involving temporary objects or container operations where efficiency
    is important.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current SpawnedPoolData object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'SpawnedPoolData data1;

      SpawnedPoolData data2 = std::move(data1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      data1 = std::move(data2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<SpawnedPoolData> poolVector;

      SpawnedPoolData newData;

      poolVector.push_back(std::move(newData)); // Efficiently moves data into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. After a move
    assignment, the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its contents
    are moved and left in a valid but unspecified state. The operation is typically
    O(1) complexity.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after performing a move assignment, as
    its state becomes undefined. Be cautious when using this operator in contexts
    where the source object might be accessed afterward.
