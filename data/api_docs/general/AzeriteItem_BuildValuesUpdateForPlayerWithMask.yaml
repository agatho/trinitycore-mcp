  method: BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask

    int & requestedObjectMask, const int & requestedItemMask, const int & requestedAzeriteItemMask,
    const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates player data with azerite item information based on specified object,
    item, and azerite masks.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask method constructs and populates
    update data for a player's azerite item attributes using three provided mask values.
    It is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    to synchronize azerite-related data between the server and client. The method
    takes into account specific object, item, and azerite item masks to determine
    which fields should be included in the update packet sent to the player. This
    functionality supports the dynamic updating of azerite powers and traits as they
    are acquired or modified during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the update data will be written.
      The array must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold all relevant update
      fields.
  - name: requestedObjectMask
    description: Integer mask specifying which object-related fields should be included
      in the update. This typically corresponds to bits in the ObjectUpdateType enumeration.
  - name: requestedItemMask
    description: Integer mask specifying which item-related fields should be included
      in the update. This controls what aspects of the azerite item's base properties
      are sent to the client.
  - name: requestedAzeriteItemMask
    description: Integer mask specifying which azerite-specific fields should be included
      in the update. This determines the azerite powers, levels, and other azerite-related
      data sent to the player.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing the source data from which
      values are copied. This represents the current state of the azerite item being
      updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      int updateData[100];

      int objectMask = 0x01;

      int itemMask = 0x02;

      int azeriteMask = 0x04;

      int sourceData[50];

      // Initialize sourceData with current azerite item values

      azeriteItem->BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(updateData, objectMask, itemMask,
      azeriteMask, sourceData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update mechanism for azerite items in
    TrinityCore. It assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    The method modifies the data array in-place and does not return any value, making
    it suitable for direct use in update packet construction without additional processing.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the mask values may cause client-side issues or incomplete
    updates. Ensure that the target array has sufficient capacity to hold all fields
    specified by the masks. This method should only be called when the player is in
    a valid state and the azerite item data is fully initialized.
