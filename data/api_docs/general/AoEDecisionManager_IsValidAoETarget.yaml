documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given unit is a valid target for area-of-effect abilities.
  description: The IsValidAoETarget method evaluates whether a specified Unit object
    meets the criteria to be considered a valid target for area-of-effect spells or
    abilities. This method typically checks factors such as the target's faction,
    health status, immunity flags, and other game-specific conditions that determine
    if the unit should be affected by AOE effects. It is commonly used within AI decision-making
    processes to filter potential targets before applying AOE damage or effects. The
    method returns true if the unit is a valid AOE target, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided Unit object is a valid target for area-of-effect
    abilities; returns false if the unit is invalid or ineligible for such effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (aoeDecisionManager.IsValidAoETarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Apply AOE\
      \ spell to target\n    caster->CastSpell(targetUnit, aoeSpellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering valid targets for AOE spell
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> validTargets;\nfor (auto& unit : nearbyUnits) {\n  \
      \  if (aoeDecisionManager.IsValidAoETarget(unit)) {\n        validTargets.push_back(unit);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Use validTargets for AOE effect application"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework in TrinityCore. It
    may perform faction checks, health status validation, and immunity flag evaluations
    to determine target eligibility. The exact implementation details depend on how
    the AoEDecisionManager class was configured for specific AI behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling. Accessing invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior
    in the game engine.
