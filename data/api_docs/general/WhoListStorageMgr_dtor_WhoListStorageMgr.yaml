documentation:
  brief: Destroys the WhoListStorageMgr instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~WhoListStorageMgr destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the WhoListStorageMgr class. This includes releasing
    any dynamically allocated storage used to maintain the list of players visible
    in the 'who' command results. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur
    when the manager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this class manages cached data for
    player visibility queries, making proper cleanup essential for server stability
    and performance.

  - title: Automatic destruction of WhoListStorageMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    WhoListStorageMgr* mgr = new WhoListStorageMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Triggers ~WhoListStorageMgr()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a WhoListStorageMgr object
    is destroyed. It's important to note that this class likely manages internal data
    structures such as maps or lists of player information, and the destructor ensures
    these are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.
