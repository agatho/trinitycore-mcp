  class: Creature
  method: GetSparringHealthPct
  signature: float Creature::GetSparringHealthPct() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current health percentage of the creature during sparring.
  description: This method retrieves the health percentage of a creature during sparring,
    which is typically used in PvP scenarios or when the creature is engaged in combat
    with a player. The returned value represents the ratio of current health to maximum
    health as a percentage, allowing developers to monitor the creature's health status
    during sparring sessions. This method is particularly useful for implementing
    custom AI behaviors or determining when a creature should be removed from combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the current health percentage of the
    creature, where 100.0f indicates full health and 0.0f indicates no health remaining.
    Values may be less than 0.0f or greater than 100.0f in special cases but typically
    ranges from 0.0f to 100.0f.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float healthPct = creature->GetSparringHealthPct();\nif (healthPct <= 25.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Creature is at low health\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may return different values depending on whether the creature
    is in sparring mode or not. It's recommended to check if the creature is engaged
    in combat before calling this method, as it may not be accurate outside of sparring
    scenarios.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the creature is actively engaged
    in sparring or PvP combat; otherwise, the returned value may be inaccurate or
    undefined.
