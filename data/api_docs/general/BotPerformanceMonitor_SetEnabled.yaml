  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot performance monitoring functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BotPerformanceMonitor is
    actively tracking and logging performance data for AI bots. When enabled, the
    monitor collects metrics such as update times, resource usage, and processing
    delays. When disabled, no data is collected until re-enabled. This method allows
    administrators or developers to toggle monitoring on/off without restarting the
    server or modifying configuration files. The state change takes effect immediately
    and affects all currently active bot instances.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the performance monitor
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Performance Monitoring
    code: BotPerformanceMonitor::SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Performance Monitoring
    code: BotPerformanceMonitor::SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and performance tuning during
    development or in production environments where monitoring needs to be temporarily
    suspended. The monitor's state persists across bot creation/destruction cycles,
    so enabling/disabling affects all future bot instances.
