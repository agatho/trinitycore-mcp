documentation:
  brief: Loads player achievement data from the database
  description: 'The LoadFromDB method retrieves and initializes all achievement-related
    data for a player from the database. This includes completed achievements, progress
    toward criteria, and any achievement-related statistics. The method is typically
    called during player login or when the achievement system needs to be refreshed.
    It processes two result sets: one for achievements and one for criteria progress,
    ensuring that the player''s achievement state is accurately reflected in memory.'
  parameters:
  - name: achievementResult
    description: Database result set containing player achievement data including
      completed achievements and their timestamps
  - name: criteriaResult
    description: Database result set containing player criteria progress data for
      active achievements
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during player login
    code: "void Player::LoadAchievements()\n{\n    QueryResult achievementResult =\
      \ CharacterDatabase.Query(\"SELECT achievement, date FROM character_achievement\
      \ WHERE guid = {}\", GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    QueryResult criteriaResult\
      \ = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"SELECT criteria, counter, date FROM character_achievement_progress\
      \ WHERE guid = {}\", GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    \n    if (achievementResult\
      \ || criteriaResult)\n    {\n        m_achievementMgr->LoadFromDB(achievementResult\
      \ ? 1 : 0, criteriaResult ? 1 : 0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after database connection is established
    and valid result sets are available. The method assumes that the database queries
    have already been executed and the results are properly formatted. It's recommended
    to call this method during player login sequence or when achievement data needs
    to be refreshed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database results can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that both achievementResult and criteriaResult parameters contain
    valid data before invoking this method. This method modifies internal achievement
    state, so it should not be called concurrently with other methods modifying the
    same data.
