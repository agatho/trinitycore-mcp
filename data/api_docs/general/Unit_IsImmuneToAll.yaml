  signature: bool Unit::IsImmuneToAll() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is immune to all effects and attacks.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit is completely immune to all forms
    of damage, control, and status effects. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    to identify units that cannot be affected by any form of attack or control, such
    as players with immunity flags or NPCs with special immune properties. The method
    returns true when the unit has no vulnerabilities to any type of effect, making
    it useful for determining whether a unit can be targeted by spells or attacks
    without any consequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is immune to all effects and attacks, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the unit cannot be affected by any form of damage, control,
    or status effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsImmuneToAll()) {\n    // Unit cannot be attacked or affected\
      \ by any spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other immunity-related
    methods to determine the complete immunity status of a unit. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight check that does not involve complex calculations or database
    queries.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking for immunity, as it
    may not account for specific types of immunity (e.g., only physical immunity or
    only magical immunity). It is recommended to use more specific methods like IsImmuneToPhysical
    or IsImmuneToMagical for detailed checks.
