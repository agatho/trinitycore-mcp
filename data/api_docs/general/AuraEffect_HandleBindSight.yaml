    mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the bind sight aura effect, allowing a player to view
    the world from another unit's perspective.
  description: The HandleBindSight method manages the application and removal of the
    bind sight aura effect. This aura allows a player to see the game world from the
    perspective of another unit, typically used for controlling creatures or in specific
    quest mechanics. When applied, it establishes a visual connection between the
    caster and target, enabling the caster to observe the target's surroundings as
    if they were located there. The method operates based on the aura application
    state and mode flags, determining whether to activate or deactivate the sight
    binding behavior. This functionality is commonly used in pet control, certain
    quest interactions, and special game mechanics where visual perspective switching
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's state, target, and
      caster.
  - name: mode
    description: Mode flag indicating how the aura should be handled. Typically represents
      different application states or activation modes for the bind sight effect.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag determining whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the bind sight effect from the target unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bind Sight Application
    code: "void ApplyBindSight(Player* player, Unit* target)\n{\n    AuraApplication*\
      \ aurApp = new AuraApplication(player, target, 0);\n    auraEffect->HandleBindSight(aurApp,\
      \ 1, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Bind Sight Effect
    code: "void RemoveBindSight(Player* player, Unit* target)\n{\n    AuraApplication*\
      \ aurApp = new AuraApplication(player, target, 0);\n    auraEffect->HandleBindSight(aurApp,\
      \ 1, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore aura system
    when processing aura applications. The bind sight effect modifies the client's
    camera perspective and requires proper synchronization between server and client
    states. Developers should ensure that both caster and target units are valid before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual glitches or client-side
    errors if not properly synchronized with the aura application lifecycle. Never
    call this method directly without proper aura context, as it may cause unexpected
    behavior in unit targeting or camera positioning.
