  class: Player
  method: ApplyModTargetResistance
  signature: void Player::ApplyModTargetResistance(int32 mod, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a modifier to the target's resistance value for the player.
  description: This method modifies the target's resistance values for the player,
    typically used in game mechanics involving magical or physical resistance adjustments.
    It applies a specified modifier to the target's resistance, which can be either
    positive or negative, affecting how much damage the target takes from certain
    types of attacks or spells. The method is commonly used in spell effects and combat
    calculations within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: The modifier value to apply to the target's resistance. This can
      be positive (increasing resistance) or negative (decreasing resistance), with
      values typically ranging from -1000 to 1000.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the modifier.
      True means the modifier is applied, false means it's removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int32 mod = 50;

      bool apply = true;

      player->ApplyModTargetResistance(mod, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resistance-related
    methods and may affect combat calculations. It should be used carefully as it
    can influence the outcome of damage dealt to targets.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect resistance values, potentially
    affecting gameplay balance and damage calculation. Ensure that the modifier value
    is within expected ranges for the game mechanics.
