  class: CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo
  method: CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo
  signature: void CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo::CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo(int * funit,
    int * enemy, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Calls nearby help creatures to assist in combat when a creature is engaged
    with an enemy within a specified range.
  description: The CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo method triggers a call for assistance
    from nearby friendly creatures that are within the defined range of the calling
    creature. This method is typically used in AI behavior to simulate group coordination
    and tactical support during combat scenarios. It searches for valid assist targets
    within the specified range, evaluates their ability to respond to the call, and
    initiates their movement or action towards the enemy. The method does not directly
    return any value but modifies the state of nearby creatures through internal AI
    mechanisms. This functionality is commonly seen in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation where NPCs can summon allies to aid them in battle.
  parameters:
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to the creature object that is issuing the call for help.
      This represents the unit initiating the assistance request.
  - name: enemy
    description: Pointer to the enemy unit that the calling creature is engaged with
      or targeting. This serves as the target for which help is being summoned.
  - name: range
    description: Float value representing the maximum distance within which assist
      creatures will be considered for the call. Creatures beyond this range will
      not respond to the assistance request.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() && me->IsWithinDist(me->GetVictim(),\
      \ 20.0f))\n    {\n        CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo(&me, &me->GetVictim(),\
      \ 15.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional checks
    code: "void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (who && me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Only call for help if boss is low on health\n        if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f)\n        {\n            CallOfHelpCreatureInRangeDo(&me, &who, 25.0f);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal AI system of TrinityCore and requires
    that both the calling creature and potential assist targets are properly initialized
    with valid AI behavior scripts. The range parameter should be carefully tuned
    to match the intended gameplay experience, as too large a range may cause performance
    issues or unrealistic behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the pointers passed to funit and enemy are valid and not null
    before calling this method. Passing invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Additionally, avoid calling this method too frequently in tight loops
    as it may impact performance due to the search and evaluation of nearby creatures.
