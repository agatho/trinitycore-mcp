documentation:
  brief: Updates the fortitude buff status for the priest AI.
  description: The UpdateFortitudeBuffs method manages the application and maintenance
    of the Fortitude buff for a priest AI. This method ensures that the priest maintains
    an appropriate level of fortitude, which is a crucial defensive buff in World
    of Warcraft. It typically checks if the buff is active on the priest or nearby
    allies, and applies it when necessary. The method is part of the general AI behavior
    system for priest NPCs, ensuring they follow proper spell usage patterns and maintain
    optimal combat effectiveness.

    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateFortitudeBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle, and may involve
    checking for existing buffs, evaluating target conditions, and applying the Fortitude
    spell if needed. The implementation likely interacts with the TrinityCore spell
    system to manage buff application.
