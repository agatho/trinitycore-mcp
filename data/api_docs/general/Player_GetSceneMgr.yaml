documentation:
  brief: Returns the scene manager instance associated with the player
  description: The GetSceneMgr method retrieves the SceneMgr object that manages scene-related
    functionality for the player. This method provides access to scene data and operations,
    including scene events, scene triggers, and scene-based gameplay mechanics. The
    returned SceneMgr instance is used for managing player-specific scenes and their
    associated behaviors within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the SceneMgr object associated with the player,
    allowing access to scene-related data and operations without modifying the scene
    manager directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "auto& sceneMgr = player->GetSceneMgr();\n// Use sceneMgr to access scene\
      \ data\nif (sceneMgr.HasScene(12345)) {\n    // Scene exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and should be used in contexts where scene data
    needs to be accessed. The SceneMgr instance returned is typically managed by the
    player object itself, so modifying it directly may affect player-specific scene
    behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be used for modifying scene data directly as it
    returns a const reference. Any modifications to scene data should be done through
    proper scene management APIs.
