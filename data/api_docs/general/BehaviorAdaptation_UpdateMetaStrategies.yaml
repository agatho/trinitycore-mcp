  brief: Updates the meta strategies for behavior adaptation in the AI system
  description: The UpdateMetaStrategies method is responsible for recalculating and
    applying updated meta-strategies to the BehaviorAdaptation class instance. This
    method typically manages high-level decision-making processes within the AI framework,
    adjusting strategic priorities based on current game state, player behavior, or
    environmental conditions. It serves as a central coordination point for adapting
    AI behaviors dynamically during runtime. The method does not require specific
    preconditions but may depend on other AI systems being properly initialized.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    behaviorAdaptation->UpdateMetaStrategies();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may involve
    performance considerations if complex strategy calculations are performed. It's
    designed to be thread-safe in most contexts, but developers should verify usage
    within multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can lead
    to unnecessary CPU overhead. Ensure that the underlying strategy calculation logic
    is efficient to avoid impacting overall AI performance.
