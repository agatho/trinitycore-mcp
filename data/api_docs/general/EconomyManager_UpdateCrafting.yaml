  brief: Updates crafting-related economy data based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateCrafting method processes and applies time-based changes
    to crafting economy mechanics within the TrinityCore server. This includes updating
    resource costs, crafting cooldowns, and any time-sensitive crafting parameters
    that may affect player crafting behavior. The method is typically called during
    the game loop to ensure that crafting systems remain synchronized with real-time
    progression. It handles internal state management for crafting-related economy
    systems without requiring external input.
