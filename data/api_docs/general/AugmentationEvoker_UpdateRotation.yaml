  class: AugmentationEvoker
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void AugmentationEvoker::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's rotation state based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for managing and updating
    the combat rotation logic of an AugmentationEvoker. It evaluates the current target
    and determines the appropriate sequence of spells or abilities to cast, ensuring
    optimal damage output or utility based on the evoker's class mechanics. This method
    typically integrates with the AI system to make real-time decisions about spell
    casting and targeting during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current target of the
      evoker. This parameter is essential for determining rotation priority and spell
      selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyEvokerAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n   \
      \     m_evoker->UpdateRotation(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop and should be invoked
    only when a valid target exists. The implementation may involve checking cooldowns,
    mana availability, and spell priorities to determine the next action in the rotation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    assumes proper initialization of the evoker's AI state.
