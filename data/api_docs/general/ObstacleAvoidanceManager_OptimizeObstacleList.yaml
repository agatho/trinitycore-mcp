documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the internal list of obstacles for pathfinding by removing duplicates
    and unnecessary entries.
  description: The OptimizeObstacleList method is responsible for cleaning up and
    optimizing the obstacle data structure used in AI pathfinding calculations. It
    removes duplicate or redundant obstacle entries from the internal list, ensuring
    that the pathfinding system operates efficiently without processing unnecessary
    data. This optimization is particularly important in complex environments where
    numerous obstacles may be present, as it reduces computational overhead during
    movement calculations. The method typically runs during pathfinding initialization
    or when obstacle data is updated to maintain optimal performance.

  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void MyAIUnit::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_obstacleManager->OptimizeObstacleList();\n\
      \    // ... continue with pathfinding ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when obstacle
    data changes or before pathfinding calculations begin. It's important to note
    that this optimization does not modify the actual world objects, but rather optimizes
    the internal representation used for pathfinding purposes.
