  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: SetEventEnabled
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::SetEventEnabled(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables a specific event within the advanced behavior manager.
  description: The SetEventEnabled method controls whether a particular event is active
    or inactive within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This functionality allows developers
    to dynamically toggle events during runtime, which can be useful for conditional
    AI behavior, quest progression, or temporary event activation. The method modifies
    internal state flags that determine if an event should be processed by the behavior
    system. When enabled, the event will be considered in decision-making processes;
    when disabled, it will be ignored. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other event management functions to create complex behavioral logic.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the event. True activates the event for processing, while false deactivates
      it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable an Event
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->SetEventEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable an Event Based on Condition
    code: "if (player->HasQuestCompleted(12345)) {\n    behaviorManager->SetEventEnabled(false);\n\
      } else {\n    behaviorManager->SetEventEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal event state flags. It's recommended
    to call this method from the main game thread to avoid potential race conditions.
    The change takes effect immediately upon calling, without requiring a behavior
    update cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method while the behavior manager is processing events may
    lead to inconsistent behavior. Ensure that all event toggling occurs during safe
    periods in the AI update loop or when no active behaviors are being evaluated.
