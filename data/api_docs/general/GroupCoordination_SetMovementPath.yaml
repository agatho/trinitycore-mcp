  class: GroupCoordination
  method: SetMovementPath
  signature: void GroupCoordination::SetMovementPath(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement path for a group coordination instance using a waypoints
    array.
  description: The SetMovementPath method configures the movement trajectory that
    a group coordination object will follow. This method is typically used in AI-driven
    group behaviors where multiple units need to move together along a predefined
    path. The method accepts a reference to an integer array representing waypoints,
    which define the sequence of locations the group should traverse. It's commonly
    used in scripted events, boss encounters, or any scenario requiring coordinated
    movement of multiple NPCs or players.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: A constant reference to an integer array containing waypoint data
      that defines the movement path for the group coordination object.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int waypoints[] = {100, 200, 300, 400};

      GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.SetMovementPath(waypoints);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Waypoint Array Example
    code: 'std::vector<int> waypoints = {150, 250, 350, 450};

      GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.SetMovementPath(waypoints.data());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the waypoints array is properly initialized and
    contains valid coordinate data. The method does not validate the waypoint values
    or ensure path feasibility, so developers should ensure proper data integrity
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unallocated pointer to the waypoints parameter may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the waypoints array remains
    valid for the duration of the group coordination's lifecycle.
