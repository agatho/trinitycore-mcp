  method: HandleAuraModIncreaseBaseManaPercent
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseBaseManaPercent(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the base mana percentage of a unit when an aura is applied or removed.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseBaseManaPercent method is responsible for
    adjusting a unit's base mana percentage in response to an aura application or
    removal. This method is part of the TrinityCore Aura system and is typically invoked
    during aura activation or deactivation. When applied, it increases the unit's
    base mana by a specified percentage, which affects the total mana pool. The effect
    is calculated based on the aura's properties and the mode of operation (application
    or removal). This functionality is commonly used in spells that boost mana regeneration
    or increase maximum mana, such as certain magical effects or buffs.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating whether the aura is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This parameter determines how the mana percentage
      modification is handled.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). Used to control the direction of the mana percentage change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Mana Increase Aura
    code: "void ApplyManaBoostAura(Unit* target, uint32 auraId) {\n    if (Aura* aura\
      \ = target->AddAura(auraId, target)) {\n        AuraApplication* aurApp = aura->GetApplicationOf(target);\n\
      \        if (aurApp) {\n            aurApp->GetEffect(0)->HandleAuraModIncreaseBaseManaPercent(aurApp,\
      \ 0, true);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Mana Increase Aura
    code: "void RemoveManaBoostAura(Unit* target, uint32 auraId) {\n    if (Aura*\
      \ aura = target->GetAura(auraId)) {\n        AuraApplication* aurApp = aura->GetApplicationOf(target);\n\
      \        if (aurApp) {\n            aurApp->GetEffect(0)->HandleAuraModIncreaseBaseManaPercent(aurApp,\
      \ 0, false);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system and should not be
    called directly from outside the core aura logic. The actual mana percentage modification
    is handled by the underlying aura effect system which updates the unit's stats
    accordingly.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to incorrect mana calculations
    or unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics. Ensure that all aura applications
    are properly managed and that the mode parameter accurately reflects whether the
    aura is being applied or removed.
