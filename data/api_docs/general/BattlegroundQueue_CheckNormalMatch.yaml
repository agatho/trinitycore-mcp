  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: CheckNormalMatch
  signature: bool BattlegroundQueue::CheckNormalMatch(int bracket_id, uint32 minPlayers,
    uint32 maxPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a normal battleground match can be formed based on player queue
    criteria
  description: The CheckNormalMatch method evaluates whether sufficient players are
    queued to form a valid battleground match within the specified bracket. It verifies
    that the minimum required number of players has been reached and ensures the queue
    is not exceeding maximum capacity limits. This method is typically called during
    battleground queue processing to determine if a match can proceed. The method
    operates on a specific bracket_id which represents different battleground tiers
    or player level ranges. It's an essential part of the battleground matchmaking
    system that helps maintain balanced and fair gameplay experiences.
  parameters:
  - name: bracket_id
    description: The identifier for the battleground bracket to check. This typically
      corresponds to different player level ranges or battleground types.
  - name: minPlayers
    description: The minimum number of players required to form a valid battleground
      match in this bracket.
  - name: maxPlayers
    description: The maximum number of players allowed in a battleground match for
      this bracket.
  returns: Returns true if a normal match can be formed with the current queue status,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when there are insufficient players
    to meet the minimum requirement or when the queue exceeds maximum capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a match is possible
    code: "if (BattlegroundQueue::CheckNormalMatch(2, 10, 40)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ battleground match creation\n    sBattlegroundMgr->CreateBattleground(\"wsg\"\
      , 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method in queue processing logic
    code: "void ProcessBattlegroundQueue() {\n    for (int bracket = 0; bracket <\
      \ MAX_BATTLEGROUND_BRACKETS; ++bracket) {\n        if (CheckNormalMatch(bracket,\
      \ 15, 60)) {\n            // Start matchmaking for this bracket\n          \
      \  StartBattlegroundMatch(bracket);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground queue processing cycles.
    It's important to note that the bracket_id parameter should correspond to valid
    battleground brackets defined in the game configuration. The method does not actually
    create or start matches, it only evaluates if conditions are met for match formation.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with dynamic bracket configurations
    as incorrect bracket_id values may lead to unexpected behavior. The method assumes
    that queue management has already been performed and player counts are accurate.
