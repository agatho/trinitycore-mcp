  brief: Moves ownership of a MovementArbiter instance to another instance using move
    semantics.
  description: The MovementArbiter constructor taking a MovementArbiter&& parameter
    is a move constructor that transfers the resources and state from one MovementArbiter
    object to another. This is part of C++'s move semantics, allowing efficient transfer
    of ownership without deep copying. In the context of TrinityCore's movement system,
    this constructor likely handles the transfer of movement-related data structures
    or references between arbiter instances, which may be used for managing unit movement
    behaviors, pathfinding, or AI decision-making. The operation is typically performed
    when an object needs to be reassigned or reinitialized with a different MovementArbiter
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference (MovementArbiter&&) to the source MovementArbiter
      object whose resources will be moved to this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a MovementArbiter
    code: 'MovementArbiter arbiter1;

      // ... perform operations on arbiter1 ...

      MovementArbiter arbiter2 = std::move(arbiter1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in a Function Context
    code: "MovementArbiter createArbiter() {\n    MovementArbiter arbiter;\n    //\
      \ ... initialize arbiter ...\n    return arbiter; // Move semantics used for\
      \ return value\n}\n\nvoid useArbiter() {\n    MovementArbiter arbiter = createArbiter();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when the source object is no longer
    needed, as its state will be moved to the new instance. After a move operation,
    the source object's state is left in a valid but unspecified state, and further
    use of it should be avoided unless explicitly reset.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object or attempting to
    use the source object after moving can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the parameter is a temporary or explicitly moved object.
