  class: SuggestionTicket
  method: GetNote
  signature: const int & SuggestionTicket::GetNote() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal note identifier associated with the suggestion
    ticket.
  description: The GetNote method retrieves the internal note identifier (likely a
    unique ID) that is associated with this SuggestionTicket instance. This identifier
    typically represents a specific note or comment within the ticketing system, allowing
    developers to access or manipulate the note data. The method returns a const reference
    to ensure the returned value cannot be modified directly through this accessor.
    This is commonly used in the context of player feedback systems where suggestions
    are tracked and managed via tickets containing various metadata including associated
    notes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the note identifier associated
    with this suggestion ticket. The actual value represents a unique identifier within
    the system's database for the specific note record.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the note ID from a suggestion ticket
    code: 'SuggestionTicket* ticket = ...; // Assume ticket is initialized

      const int& noteId = ticket->GetNote();

      // Use noteId to query related data or perform operations

      std::cout << "Note ID: " << noteId << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified. The underlying integer represents an internal database identifier
    and may be used to join with other tables or records in the database. Ensure that
    the SuggestionTicket object is valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling GetNote on a null or uninitialized SuggestionTicket pointer will
    result in undefined behavior. Always validate the ticket object before invoking
    this method. Since it returns a const reference, modifying the returned value
    through this interface is not possible, but be cautious of potential lifetime
    issues if the ticket object is destroyed while the reference is still being used.
