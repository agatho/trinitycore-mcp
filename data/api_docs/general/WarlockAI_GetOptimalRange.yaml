  class: WarlockAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float WarlockAI::GetOptimalRange(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for a warlock based on target
    unit.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    Warlock should engage an enemy target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account the warlock's current spell abilities, pet status, and combat
    mechanics to provide a dynamic range value. The returned float represents the
    distance in yards where the warlock should position themselves for optimal damage
    output or spell casting efficiency. This method is typically used internally by
    the AI system to make tactical decisions about movement and targeting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. This value
    indicates the recommended distance from the target unit where the warlock should
    position themselves for best combat performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = warlockAI->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\nif (warlockAI->GetDistanceTo(targetUnit)\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    warlockAI->MoveTo(targetUnit, optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers spell range limitations, pet positioning, and
    combat behavior patterns specific to warlock class mechanics. The implementation
    may vary based on the warlock's current spell selection and active abilities.
