documentation:
  brief: Processes the selection of a quest reward for a player character.
  description: The HandleQuestRewardSelection method is responsible for managing the
    logic when a player selects a reward option for a completed quest. This method
    typically handles the distribution of items, experience points, or other rewards
    based on the selected reward option. It interacts with the player's quest data
    and ensures proper reward delivery according to the game's quest system mechanics.
    The method may also update quest completion status and trigger any associated
    quest events or follow-up actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who is selecting
      the quest reward.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the reward is being selected.
      Must correspond to a valid completed quest in the player's quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Selection
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::HandleQuestRewardSelection(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest has already been completed and is in a
    state where reward selection can occur. It does not validate whether the player
    has actually completed the quest before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the quest is properly completed may
    lead to unexpected behavior or reward distribution issues. The method should only
    be invoked when the quest state is valid for reward selection.
