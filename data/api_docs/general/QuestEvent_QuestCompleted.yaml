documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a QuestEvent object indicating that a quest has been
    completed by a player.
  description: The QuestCompleted method is a static factory function within the QuestEvent
    class that generates a new QuestEvent instance to represent the completion of
    a specific quest by a player. This method is typically used in event-driven systems
    or quest handling logic within TrinityCore's core framework. It encapsulates the
    necessary information about the quest completion, including the player identifier
    and quest ID, allowing for proper event propagation and handling throughout the
    game system. The returned QuestEvent object can then be used to trigger callbacks,
    update quest states, or notify other subsystems about the completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: A new QuestEvent object representing the completed quest, containing the
    player identifier and quest ID information for further processing within the TrinityCore
    event system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Event Creation
    code: 'QuestEvent event = QuestEvent::QuestCompleted(12345, 67890);

      // This creates a quest completion event for player 12345 and quest 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Quest Event in Quest Handling Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n   \
      \ QuestEvent event = QuestEvent::QuestCompleted(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ questId);\n    // Process the event or pass it to event handlers\n    event.Process();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed as a static factory function and does not modify
    any global state. It's intended for creating immutable event objects that can
    be passed around and processed by various subsystems in the TrinityCore framework.
    The player parameter should typically be a valid player GUID counter value, and
    questId must correspond to an existing quest in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the player identifier and quest ID parameters are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior or errors
    in downstream event processing. This method does not perform validation of the
    quest existence or player status; it simply creates the event object.
