documentation:
  brief: Selects the quality level for bot gear based on player level and inventory
    slot
  description: The SelectQuality method determines the appropriate item quality for
    a bot's equipment based on the player's level and the specific inventory slot
    being filled. This method is part of the BotGearFactory class which handles automated
    gear generation for bot characters in TrinityCore. The quality selection follows
    game mechanics that typically increase with player level, ensuring bots receive
    gear appropriate to their progression. The method considers both the character's
    current level and the equipment slot (such as head, chest, weapon, etc.) to return
    a quality value that corresponds to standard WoW item quality tiers.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The player level of the bot character. Used to determine quality
      tier progression. Valid values are typically between 1 and 80 for standard WoW
      content.
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index that the gear will be equipped in. Slot
      values correspond to standard WoW equipment slots (e.g., 0=Head, 1=Chest, 2=Shoulders,
      etc.). Valid range depends on the game's equipment system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the item quality tier. Common quality
    values include 0 (Poor), 1 (Common), 2 (Uncommon), 3 (Rare), 4 (Epic), 5 (Legendary),
    and potentially higher tiers depending on game version and expansion content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quality Selection
    code: 'uint32 quality = botGearFactory.SelectQuality(60, 4);

      // Returns quality value appropriate for level 60 character''s chest slot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quality Selection for High-Level Bot
    code: 'uint32 weaponQuality = botGearFactory.SelectQuality(80, 16);

      // Selects quality for a level 80 bot''s main hand weapon slot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal tables or algorithms to map level and slot
    combinations to appropriate quality tiers. The implementation may vary based on
    expansion content, with different quality progression curves for classic, wrath,
    cataclysm, etc. The method is probably called during bot gear generation routines
    and should be thread-safe as it's a stateless operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the level parameter does not exceed maximum supported player
    levels in the current game version, as this could lead to invalid quality selections
    or out-of-bounds access. The slot parameter must correspond to valid equipment
    slots; invalid values may return unexpected quality tiers.
