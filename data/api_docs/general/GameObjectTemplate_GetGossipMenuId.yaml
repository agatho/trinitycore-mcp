documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the gossip menu identifier associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetGossipMenuId method returns the unique identifier of the gossip
    menu that is linked to this game object template. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    game objects such as quest givers, vendors, or interactive NPCs can have associated
    gossip menus that define the options presented to players when they interact with
    them. This method allows developers and scripters to retrieve the menu ID for
    a specific game object template, which is essential for implementing proper interaction
    logic and linking custom gossip systems to game objects. The returned value typically
    corresponds to an entry in the `gossip_menu` table within the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the gossip menu ID associated with this game
    object template. If no gossip menu is assigned, the method returns 0, indicating
    that no interaction menu will be displayed upon player interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Gossip Menu
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate)\n{\n    uint32 gossipId = goTemplate->GetGossipMenuId();\n \
      \   if (gossipId > 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with custom gossip logic\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"GameObject has gossip menu ID: %u\", gossipId);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"GameObject has no associated\
      \ gossip menu.\");\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with the gossip system to determine
    how players interact with game objects. It's important to note that a return value
    of zero does not necessarily indicate an error but rather means there is no defined
    gossip menu for this object.
