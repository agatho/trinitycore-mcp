documentation:
  brief: Evaluates current arena match conditions to determine if win criteria have
    been met
  description: The CheckWinConditions method assesses the state of an arena match
    to determine whether any team has fulfilled the victory requirements. This includes
    checking for player deaths, time limits, and other match-specific rules that define
    when a team wins. The method is typically invoked during arena match updates or
    when player states change to ensure real-time evaluation of win conditions. It
    performs internal logic to validate team survival status and match duration against
    configured arena parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arena Win Condition Check
    code: "void MyArenaScript::OnUpdate()\n{\n    arena->CheckWinConditions();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the arena system during match
    updates and should not typically be invoked directly by external code. The implementation
    may trigger match end events when win conditions are met, which could lead to
    further processing such as awarding rewards or updating player statistics.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of normal match update cycles
    may cause unexpected behavior or inconsistent match states. It's designed to be
    called automatically by the arena framework during appropriate game ticks.
