  class: BalanceDruidRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void BalanceDruidRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the balance druid's AoE rotation logic based on the number of nearby
    enemies.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a balance
    druid's area-of-effect combat rotation. It determines which spells or abilities
    to cast based on the current number of enemy targets within range, player resource
    levels (such as mana and lunar/fungal energy), and the druid's current combat
    state. This method is typically called during combat situations where multiple
    enemies are present, allowing the druid to efficiently manage threat and damage
    output. The method may also consider factors such as cooldowns, spell priorities,
    and environmental conditions to optimize the rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers (likely GUIDs or pointers)
      representing the enemies currently in range for AoE casting. The method uses
      this to determine targeting priority and spell application.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Integer value indicating the total number of enemy targets within
      the druid's effective AoE range. This determines which rotation strategy is
      applied (e.g., single-target spells vs. multi-target spells).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyBalanceDruidAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Assume we have a list\
      \ of nearby enemies\n    int targets[10];\n    uint32 count = GetNearbyEnemies(targets,\
      \ 10);\n    ExecuteAoERotation(targets, count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Rotation with Resource Management
    code: "void BalanceDruidRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int* target, uint32 enemyCount)\n\
      {\n    if (enemyCount >= 3)\n        CastMoonfire();\n    else\n        CastStarfall();\n\
      \    // Additional logic for managing energy and cooldowns\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the druid is in combat and has valid targets. It
    does not perform any checks for player status or spell availability beyond basic
    rotation logic. The implementation should be called only when appropriate, typically
    within a combat loop or event handler.
  warnings: Ensure that the target array contains valid identifiers before passing
    to this method; invalid pointers may cause crashes. Also, be aware that enemyCount
    must accurately reflect the number of valid targets to avoid incorrect spell selection.
