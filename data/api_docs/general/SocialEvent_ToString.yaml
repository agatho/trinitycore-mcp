documentation:
  brief: Converts the social event data into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method serializes the internal state of a SocialEvent
    object into a formatted string. This method is typically used for debugging, logging,
    or displaying event information in a readable format. The output string includes
    key details about the event such as its type, associated players, timestamp, and
    other relevant metadata. The method does not modify the object's state and is
    safe to call multiple times. It follows the standard C++ string formatting conventions
    and should be used primarily for development and diagnostic purposes rather than
    for programmatic logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the social event,
    including relevant event details such as type, participants, and metadata.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'SocialEvent event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("social", "Event details: {}", eventString);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and logging purposes. The
    exact format of the returned string may change between different versions of TrinityCore.
    It's recommended to use this method only when necessary as it involves string
    construction which may have performance implications in high-frequency scenarios.
