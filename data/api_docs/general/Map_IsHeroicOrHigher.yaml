  signature: bool Map::IsHeroicOrHigher() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is in heroic difficulty or higher.
  description: This method checks if the current map instance is set to heroic difficulty
    or greater. It returns true if the map's difficulty level is at least heroic,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    server-side code to determine whether players are entering content that requires
    higher difficulty levels than normal. The method is particularly useful for checking
    if a map has been configured for heroic or raid difficulty, which affects player
    progression and loot distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is in heroic or higher difficulty level, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the map's current difficulty setting allows
    for heroic or raid content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsHeroicOrHigher())\n{\n    // Player can enter heroic content\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot enter heroic content\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map difficulty-related
    functions to determine player eligibility for certain content. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight operation that simply checks the map's difficulty setting.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking specific
    difficulty levels (like heroic vs raid) without understanding the context of your
    code. The method only returns true if the map is set to heroic or higher, not
    necessarily whether it's actually a raid instance.
