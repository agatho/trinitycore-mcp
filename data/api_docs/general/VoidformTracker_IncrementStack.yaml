  signature: void VoidformTracker::IncrementStack()
documentation:
  brief: Increments the stack count of the Voidform aura by one unit.
  description: The IncrementStack method increases the current stack count of the
    Voidform tracker by a single unit. This method is typically invoked when a player
    gains additional Voidform stacks through spell effects, abilities, or other game
    mechanics that enhance the Voidform buff. The method does not validate whether
    the new stack count exceeds maximum limits; it simply increments the internal
    counter. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate tracking of
    the Voidform aura's intensity during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void ApplyVoidformEffect(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetAura(VOIDFORM_AURA_ID))\n\
      \    {\n        VoidformTracker* tracker = player->GetVoidformTracker();\n \
      \       tracker->IncrementStack();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal stack counter of the Voidform
    aura. It should only be called when a valid Voidform state exists, otherwise unexpected
    behavior may occur. The method is designed to be lightweight and does not perform
    any validation or side effects beyond incrementing the counter.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the player has an active Voidform
    aura may lead to incorrect stack tracking. Always verify the existence of the
    aura before invoking IncrementStack() to prevent unintended behavior.
