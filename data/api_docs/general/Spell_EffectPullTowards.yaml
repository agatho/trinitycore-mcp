  brief: Pulls targets toward the caster using a spell effect.
  description: The EffectPullTowards method represents a spell effect that pulls targeted
    enemies or objects toward the caster's position. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other pull effects to create movement mechanics such as dragging
    enemies closer, or pulling objects toward the caster. It is commonly found in
    spells that utilize the 'pull' mechanic, such as those involving area of effect
    or targeting. The method does not return any value but performs a specific action
    related to movement and positioning within the game world.

    targeting and validation before execution. It may be used in combination with
    other movement-related effects to achieve desired gameplay behavior.

    game mechanics related to positioning and movement. Incorrect usage can lead to
    unexpected behavior or client-side issues.
