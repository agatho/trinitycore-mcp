  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: SetFlightMasterFactionTemplateId
  signature: void PlayerTaxi::SetFlightMasterFactionTemplateId(uint32 factionTemplateId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the faction template ID associated with the player's flight master.
  description: This method assigns a specific faction template identifier to the player's
    flight master, which determines the faction-related behavior and interactions
    for taxi services. The faction template ID controls whether the flight master
    is hostile, friendly, or neutral to the player based on their current faction.
    This is typically used during quest progression or faction-specific taxi route
    unlocking. The method does not validate the provided faction template ID against
    existing game data, so it's important to ensure that the value corresponds to
    a valid faction template in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: factionTemplateId
    description: The unique identifier for the faction template that defines the flight
      master's faction relationship. This value should correspond to an existing faction
      template entry in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Flight Master Faction Template
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      player->GetTaxi().SetFlightMasterFactionTemplateId(1350); // Set to faction
      template for Stormwind

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state related to the player's taxi
    system and faction interactions. Changes made using this method will persist until
    overwritten by another call or until the player logs out. It is recommended to
    use this method only when necessary, such as during quest completion or faction
    change events.
  warnings: Incorrect faction template IDs may cause unexpected behavior in flight
    master interactions, including inability to access taxi nodes or incorrect gossip
    options. Ensure that the provided ID corresponds to a valid faction template in
    your database before calling this method.
