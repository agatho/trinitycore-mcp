  signature: void QuestManager::UpdateQuestCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal quest cache with the latest quest data from the database.
  description: The UpdateQuestCache method refreshes the in-memory quest cache within
    the QuestManager class. This ensures that all quest-related operations use the
    most up-to-date quest information from the database, including quest states, objectives,
    and rewards. The method is typically invoked during player login, quest updates,
    or when quest data needs to be synchronized with the server's current state. It
    performs a complete refresh of the cached quest data without requiring explicit
    parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    sQuestMgr->UpdateQuestCache();\n\
      \    // Quest cache is now synchronized with database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full cache refresh, which may have performance implications
    during high-traffic periods. It should typically be called during player login
    or when quest data is known to have changed. The method is not thread-safe and
    should only be called from the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling UpdateQuestCache too frequently can cause performance degradation
    due to database queries. Avoid invoking it in tight loops or high-frequency update
    scenarios. Ensure that no other quest-related operations are in progress when
    calling this method.
