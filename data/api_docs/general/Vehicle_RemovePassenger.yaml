  class: Vehicle
  method: RemovePassenger
  signature: Vehicle * Vehicle::RemovePassenger(WorldObject * passenger)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a passenger from the vehicle and returns a pointer to the vehicle.
  description: The RemovePassenger method removes a specified passenger from the vehicle.
    It is used to eject or dismount players or creatures from vehicles in World of
    Warcraft. The method updates internal passenger tracking structures and may trigger
    related events such as passenger removal notifications. This function typically
    handles cleanup of passenger state and ensures that the vehicle's passenger list
    is properly maintained. The operation is generally synchronous and affects only
    the specific passenger being removed.
  parameters:
  - name: passenger
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject representing the passenger to be removed
      from the vehicle. Must be a valid object currently seated on this vehicle.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Vehicle instance that had the passenger removed,
    allowing for method chaining or further operations on the vehicle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Passenger Removal
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->RemovePassenger(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Passenger Removal with Null Check
    code: "if (player && player->IsInVehicle())\n{\n    Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\n\
      \    if (vehicle)\n    {\n        Vehicle* result = vehicle->RemovePassenger(player);\n\
      \        // Use result for further operations if needed\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on passengers who are currently seated
    on the vehicle. Calling it on a passenger not in the vehicle may lead to undefined
    behavior or internal state corruption. The method does not directly handle player
    dismount animations or visual effects; these are typically managed by separate
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the passenger pointer is valid and refers to an object actually
    seated on this vehicle before calling RemovePassenger. Failing to do so may cause
    crashes or inconsistent vehicle state. Avoid calling this method from within a
    loop iterating over passengers, as it modifies the container being iterated.
