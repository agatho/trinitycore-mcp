  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetQuestChainSequence
  signature: int QuestPickup::GetQuestChainSequence(uint32 startingQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the sequential position of a quest within a quest chain based
    on its starting quest ID.
  description: The GetQuestChainSequence method calculates and returns the sequential
    index of a specified quest within a quest chain, using the provided starting quest
    ID as reference. This functionality is essential for determining the order in
    which quests should be presented or completed within a linked series of quests.
    The method typically evaluates the relationship between quests based on their
    dependencies and progression logic defined in the game's quest system. It assumes
    that the quest chain has been properly initialized and that the starting quest
    ID corresponds to an existing quest in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the sequential position of the quest within
    its chain, where 0 indicates the first quest in the sequence, 1 indicates the
    second, and so on. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid quest ID
    was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Chain Sequence
    code: "int sequence = questPickup->GetQuestChainSequence(12345);\nif (sequence\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Quest is at position %d in the chain\\n\", sequence);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Invalid quest ID or error occurred\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal quest relationship data structures
    and may cache results for performance. It is recommended to validate the quest
    ID before calling this method to avoid unexpected negative return values.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect sequence numbers. Ensure that the quest ID
    exists in the database before invoking this function.
