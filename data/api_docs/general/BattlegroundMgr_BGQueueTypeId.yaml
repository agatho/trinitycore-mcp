  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: BGQueueTypeId
  signature: int BattlegroundMgr::BGQueueTypeId(uint16 battlemasterListId, BattlegroundQueueIdType
    type, bool rated, uint8 teamSize)
documentation:
  brief: Maps a battleground master list ID and queue type to a unique battleground
    queue identifier.
  description: The BGQueueTypeId method translates a given battleground master list
    ID, queue type, rated flag, and team size into a unique queue identifier used
    internally by the BattlegroundMgr. This mapping is essential for managing different
    battleground queues such as normal, rated, and specific team size variations.
    The method serves as a lookup mechanism to ensure that players are directed to
    the correct battleground queue based on their selection criteria. It's commonly
    used during battleground queue initialization and player matchmaking processes.
  parameters:
  - name: battlemasterListId
    description: The unique identifier of the battleground master list entry, typically
      corresponding to a specific battleground type or instance.
  - name: type
    description: The queue type identifier indicating the kind of battleground queue
      (e.g., normal, rated, arena).
  - name: rated
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the queue is for rated matches (true)
      or casual matches (false).
  - name: teamSize
    description: The size of the team participating in the battleground queue, typically
      0 for solo queues or 1-5 for team-based battlegrounds.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unique battleground queue identifier.
    A negative value may indicate an error or invalid input combination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int queueId = sBattlegroundMgr->BGQueueTypeId(1234, BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_AV,
      false, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Rated Battleground Queue
    code: int ratedQueueId = sBattlegroundMgr->BGQueueTypeId(5678, BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_WS,
      true, 15);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with battleground queue management
    systems to ensure proper matchmaking. The returned queue ID can be used to retrieve
    or modify queue-specific settings and player entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the battlemasterListId corresponds to an actual registered
    battleground type, otherwise the result may be invalid or cause unexpected behavior
    during queue processing.
