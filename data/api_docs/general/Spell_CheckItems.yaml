documentation:
  brief: Checks spell items and returns the result of the spell cast check
  description: The CheckItems method evaluates the spell's item requirements and determines
    whether the spell can be cast successfully. It examines the spell's item-related
    parameters such as required items, reagents, and consumable items to validate
    if the caster has the necessary resources. This method is typically used during
    spell casting validation to ensure that all item requirements are met before proceeding
    with the actual spell execution. The method returns a SpellCastResult indicating
    whether the spell can proceed or if there's an error condition.
  parameters:
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the first item requirement parameter, typically representing
      required items or reagents for the spell
  - name: param2
    description: Pointer to the second item requirement parameter, often used for
      additional item checks or reagent validation
  returns: SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast successfully or
    if there's an error condition. Possible values include SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS, SPELL_CAST_ERROR,
    and other specific error codes depending on item requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckItems(&item1, &item2);\nif (result\
      \ == SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckItems(&item1, &item2);\nswitch (result)\n\
      {\n    case SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS:\n        // Spell can be cast\n        break;\n\
      \    case SPELL_CAST_ERROR:\n        // Handle error condition\n        break;\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell validation process and should be called
    before actual spell execution. It's typically used in conjunction with other spell
    checking methods to ensure complete validation of spell requirements.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always return a valid
    result if item parameters are not properly initialized or if the spell has no
    item requirements.
