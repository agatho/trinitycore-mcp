  method: GetScriptName
  signature: const std::string & BattlegroundMap::GetScriptName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script name associated with the battleground map instance.
  description: The GetScriptName method retrieves the unique identifier string that
    corresponds to the script assigned to a specific battleground map. This script
    name is typically used by the game engine to locate and initialize the appropriate
    battleground logic, including event handling, scoring systems, and win/loss conditions.
    The returned string usually matches the name of a C++ class or script file that
    implements the battleground's behavior. This method is commonly called during
    battleground initialization and can be used for debugging or logging purposes
    to identify which battleground script is active.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the script name associated
    with this battleground map instance. The string represents the identifier used
    by the TrinityCore framework to load and execute the specific battleground logic.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Script Name
    code: 'BattlegroundMap* bgMap = sWorld->GetMap(1234);

      const std::string& scriptName = bgMap->GetScriptName();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Current battleground script: %s", scriptName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Script Name for Custom Logic
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = player->GetBattlegroundMap();\nconst std::string&\
      \ scriptName = bgMap->GetScriptName();\nif (scriptName == \"battleground_arena_5v5\"\
      ) {\n    // Apply specific arena 5v5 rules\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying of
    the string. The script name is typically set during map initialization and should
    remain consistent throughout the battleground's lifecycle. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads immutable data.
