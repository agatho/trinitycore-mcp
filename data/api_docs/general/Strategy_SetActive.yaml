  class: Strategy
  method: SetActive
  signature: void Strategy::SetActive(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates the strategy for use in AI decision making.
  description: The SetActive method toggles the active state of a strategy within
    the TrinityCore AI system. When a strategy is set to active, it becomes eligible
    for consideration during AI decision-making processes. When inactive, the strategy
    is ignored by the AI controller. This method is commonly used to enable or disable
    specific behavioral patterns in NPC AI, allowing for dynamic control over how
    creatures respond to various situations during gameplay. The activation state
    directly affects which strategies are evaluated when the AI selects actions.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the strategy
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a combat strategy
    code: 'Strategy* combatStrategy = ai->GetStrategy("combat");

      combatStrategy->SetActive(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate an idle behavior strategy
    code: 'Strategy* idleStrategy = ai->GetStrategy("idle");

      idleStrategy->SetActive(false);

      // AI will no longer consider idle behaviors for this creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags that are checked during AI update
    cycles. Changes take effect immediately upon the next AI decision cycle, not instantly.
    The strategy's active state is typically persisted across AI updates and can be
    queried using GetActive() method.
  warnings: Setting a strategy to inactive does not immediately stop any ongoing actions
    that were initiated by that strategy. The AI may continue executing the current
    action until it naturally completes or is interrupted.
