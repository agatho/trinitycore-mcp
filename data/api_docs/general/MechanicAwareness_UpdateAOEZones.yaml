documentation:
  brief: Updates the awareness of area-of-effect zones for mechanics within the current
    game context.
  description: The UpdateAOEZones method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the state of area-of-effect (AOE) zone awareness within the MechanicAwareness
    system. This method processes all active AOE effects in the current time frame,
    checking for player or unit interactions with these zones. It ensures that mechanics
    such as traps, spells, or environmental hazards properly detect and respond to
    affected targets. The method operates on a per-tick basis using the provided current
    time value to determine which zones should be evaluated and updated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateMechanicAwareness()\n{\n    mechanicAwareness.UpdateAOEZones(getMSTime());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game loop or tick handler.
    It's designed to be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations by only processing
    zones that are currently active or have recently changed state. The method relies
    on accurate timing information to ensure proper zone evaluation.
  warnings: Improper handling of time values can cause incorrect zone detection behavior.
    Ensure that the currentTime parameter accurately reflects the current game tick
    or frame time for consistent results.
