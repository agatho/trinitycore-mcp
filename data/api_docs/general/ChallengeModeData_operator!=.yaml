  class: ChallengeModeData
  method: operator!=
  signature: bool ChallengeModeData::operator!=(const ChallengeModeData & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ChallengeModeData objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ChallengeModeData
    instance and another ChallengeModeData object to determine if they are not equal.
    It returns true if any of the challenge mode data members differ between the two
    objects, and false if all members are identical. This comparison is typically
    used in container operations or when determining whether challenge mode data has
    changed during a game session. The method performs element-wise comparison of
    the challenge mode properties such as dungeon ID, level, and other relevant metadata.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ChallengeModeData object to compare against this instance
  returns: True if the two ChallengeModeData objects are not equal, false if they
    are identical
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: 'ChallengeModeData data1;

      ChallengeModeData data2;

      bool result = (data1 != data2); // Returns true if data differs

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic
    code: "if (playerChallengeData != savedChallengeData) {\n    // Update player's\
      \ challenge mode progress\n    player->UpdateChallengeModeProgress();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a member-wise comparison of
    all relevant fields in the ChallengeModeData structure. It's important to note
    that this comparison may involve multiple data members including dungeon identifiers,
    challenge levels, and completion timestamps.
