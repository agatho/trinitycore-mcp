documentation:
  brief: Sends an interrupted spell message to the player's client
  description: The SendInterrupted method is used to notify the player's client that
    a spell has been interrupted by an external force, such as movement or damage.
    This method is typically called when a spell is interrupted during its casting
    process, and it sends a specific interrupt message to the client indicating the
    reason for interruption. The method is part of the Spell class and is used in
    conjunction with other spell-related methods to manage spell execution and interruption
    handling.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The interrupt result code that indicates why the spell was interrupted.
      Valid values include 0 (no interrupt), 1 (interrupted by movement), 2 (interrupted
      by damage), and other values depending on the specific interruption scenario.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SendInterrupted(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Interruption with Damage
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SendInterrupted(2);

      // This would be called when player takes damage during spell casting'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell interruption
    methods and should only be called when a spell is actually interrupted. The method
    does not directly affect the spell's execution but rather sends a message to the
    client about the interruption status.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a spell is truly interrupted; calling
    it incorrectly may cause client-side confusion or unexpected behavior. Also, this
    method should not be used for spells that are not currently being cast.
