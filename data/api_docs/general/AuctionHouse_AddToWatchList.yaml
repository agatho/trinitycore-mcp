  method: AddToWatchList
  signature: void AuctionHouse::AddToWatchList(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to a player's auction house watch list.
  description: The AddToWatchList method registers a specific item for monitoring
    within the auction house system. When an item is added to a player's watch list,
    the game will notify the player when that item becomes available for auction or
    when its price changes significantly. This functionality allows players to track
    items of interest without constantly checking the auction house interface. The
    method requires both the player's unique identifier (GUID) and the item's ID to
    perform the addition. It is typically used in conjunction with other auction house
    operations such as item bidding, listing, and notifications.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will be watching the
      item. This value must correspond to a valid online player character in the game
      world.
  - name: itemId
    description: The database ID of the item to be added to the watch list. This ID
      should reference an existing item in the game's item database and must be a
      valid item template identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;

      uint32 playerGUID = 12345;

      uint32 itemID = 34567;

      ah->AddToWatchList(playerGUID, itemID);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Items to Watch List
    code: "AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;\nuint32 playerGUID = 12345;\nstd::vector<uint32>\
      \ itemsToWatch = {34567, 89012, 56789};\nfor (uint32 itemID : itemsToWatch)\n\
      {\n    ah->AddToWatchList(playerGUID, itemID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the player is online or the item exists
    in the database. It simply adds the entry to an internal watch list structure.
    The actual notification logic for watched items is handled separately by the auction
    house system and may involve database queries or event triggers.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUIDs or item IDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or silent failures. Ensure that playerGuid refers to a valid online character
    and itemId corresponds to an existing item template before invoking this method.
