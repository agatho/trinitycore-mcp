  method: PerformStatisticalAnalysis
  signature: void BotProfiler::PerformStatisticalAnalysis(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Performs statistical analysis on bot behavior data for the specified session
    ID
  description: The PerformStatisticalAnalysis method executes a comprehensive statistical
    evaluation of bot performance and behavior patterns within the specified session.
    This method processes collected data from bot activities, including action frequency,
    decision-making patterns, and response times to generate meaningful metrics. The
    analysis is typically used for optimizing bot AI behavior, identifying performance
    bottlenecks, or generating reports for game balance adjustments. The method operates
    on session-specific data and requires that profiling data has been previously
    collected for the given session ID.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the bot session to analyze. This value must
      correspond to a previously recorded profiling session in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Statistical Analysis
    code: 'uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;

      BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.PerformStatisticalAnalysis(sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Analysis with Session Validation
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = GetActiveBotSession();\nif (sessionId != 0)\n{\n \
      \   BotProfiler profiler;\n    profiler.PerformStatisticalAnalysis(sessionId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid session case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called asynchronously to avoid blocking the main
    game thread. The statistical analysis may involve processing large datasets, so
    performance can vary based on the amount of collected data. The results are usually
    stored internally for later retrieval or reporting.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure that the session has been properly
    initialized and data has been collected before invoking this analysis.
