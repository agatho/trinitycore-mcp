  signature: bool Player::isAllowedToLoot(const Creature * creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is allowed to loot a creature based on game
    rules and conditions.
  description: The method checks if the player can loot a given creature according
    to World of Warcraft game mechanics. It evaluates various conditions such as whether
    the creature is a corpse, whether the player has permission to loot it, and whether
    the looting requirements are met. This method is commonly used in loot handling
    systems to determine if a player can obtain items from a defeated creature. The
    function considers factors like player level, creature type, and game rules related
    to looting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is allowed to loot the creature, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player has the necessary permissions or conditions
    to extract items from the creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->isAllowedToLoot(creature)) {\n    // Player can loot the creature\n\
      \    // Proceed with loot handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other looting-related methods
    to determine if a player can loot a creature. It may be called during the looting
    process when checking whether a player has access to items from a creature. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method only performs simple checks.
  warnings: This method does not check for specific player conditions such as being
    in a group or having a valid loot roll. It only evaluates whether the player is
    allowed to loot the creature based on general game rules, so it's important to
    verify that other conditions are met before proceeding with actual looting.
