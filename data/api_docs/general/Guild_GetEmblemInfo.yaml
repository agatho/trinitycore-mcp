  method: GetEmblemInfo
  signature: const EmblemInfo & Guild::GetEmblemInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the emblem information associated with the guild.
  description: The GetEmblemInfo method returns a constant reference to the EmblemInfo
    structure that contains all relevant data about the guild's emblem, including
    its style, color, and icon. This information is used for displaying the guild's
    visual identity in the game interface and related systems. The returned reference
    is guaranteed to be valid as long as the Guild object exists and has not been
    modified. This method does not perform any operations that would alter the state
    of the guild or its emblem data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an EmblemInfo structure containing the guild's
    emblem details such as style, colors, and icon information. The reference remains
    valid for the lifetime of the Guild object.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Guild Emblem Information
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n    const\
      \ EmblemInfo& emblemInfo = guild->GetEmblemInfo();\n    // Use emblemInfo to\
      \ display or process guild emblem data\n    uint32 style = emblemInfo.emblemStyle;\n\
      \    uint32 color = emblemInfo.emblemColor;\n    uint32 borderStyle = emblemInfo.borderStyle;\n\
      \    uint32 borderColor = emblemInfo.borderColor;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned EmblemInfo reference should not be modified directly as it is
    part of the internal state of the Guild. Any changes to the emblem data should
    be made through appropriate Guild management methods. This method is thread-safe
    when used on a const Guild object.
