api:
  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindQuestTurnInNpc
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::FindQuestTurnInNpc(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the NPC associated with turning in a specified quest for
    the given player.
  description: The FindQuestTurnInNpc method searches for the appropriate Non-Player
    Character (NPC) that accepts the specified quest from the provided player. It
    typically looks through the player's available quests and identifies the quest-giver
    NPC responsible for completing the quest. This method is commonly used in automated
    quest completion systems or botting logic within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft
    servers. The function verifies that the quest is active and can be turned in by
    the player, ensuring proper game mechanics compliance. It may also perform internal
    checks to confirm the NPC is within interaction range and available for quest
    submission.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest turn-in NPC is being searched.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the turn-in NPC is being
      located. Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  returns: Returns true if a valid quest turn-in NPC was found and can be interacted
    with; otherwise returns false if no suitable NPC exists or the quest cannot be
    turned in.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find quest turn-in NPC
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 12345;\nif (QuestCompletion::FindQuestTurnInNpc(player, questId)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with quest completion logic\n    printf(\"Found quest turn-in NPC\
      \ for quest %u\\n\", questId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No valid NPC found for\
      \ quest %u\\n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal quest data structures and may cache
    results for performance. It assumes the player has active access to the specified
    quest and that the quest is in a state where it can be turned in. The implementation
    might involve database lookups or cached quest-giver mappings.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying quest status may lead to
    invalid NPC interactions. Ensure that the quest ID corresponds to an actual quest
    in the game database, otherwise behavior is undefined.
