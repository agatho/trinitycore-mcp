documentation:
  brief: Updates the danger zones in the pathfinding manager based on current time.
  description: The UpdateDangerZones method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the state of danger zones within the PathfindingManager. These danger zones typically
    represent areas in the game world that are hazardous or restricted to AI pathfinding,
    such as areas with environmental hazards, enemy-controlled territories, or temporary
    obstacles. The method uses the provided current time to determine which danger
    zones should be active or inactive, ensuring that the pathfinding system avoids
    these areas when calculating routes for NPCs or players. This method is typically
    called during the game loop at regular intervals to keep the danger zone data
    synchronized with the current game state.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all systems including pathfinding\n\
      \    pathfindingManager.UpdateDangerZones(getCurrentTime());\n    // Other update\
      \ logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through registered danger zones and updates their
    active status based on time-based conditions. It may also handle cleanup of expired
    danger zones or trigger events when danger zone states change. The method is performance-sensitive
    as it's called frequently during the game loop.
