documentation:
  brief: Compares two RecipeProgressionInfo objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this RecipeProgressionInfo
    instance and another RecipeProgressionInfo object to determine if they are not
    equal. It typically compares all relevant member variables or fields of the two
    objects to check for differences. This operator is commonly used in game systems
    where recipe progression data needs to be tracked, compared, or validated against
    other instances. The comparison may involve checking recipe IDs, progression states,
    player associations, or other relevant attributes depending on the implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The RecipeProgressionInfo object to compare against this instance.
  returns: Returns true if the two RecipeProgressionInfo objects are not equal, false
    otherwise. The comparison is typically based on all relevant member variables
    of the class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two recipe progression instances
    code: 'RecipeProgressionInfo recipe1;

      RecipeProgressionInfo recipe2;

      // Assume both objects are initialized with different data

      bool areNotEqual = (recipe1 != recipe2); // Returns true if they differ in any
      field'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using inequality operator in a conditional loop for progression tracking
    code: "RecipeProgressionInfo currentProgress;\nRecipeProgressionInfo previousProgress;\n\
      \nif (currentProgress != previousProgress) {\n    // Recipe progression has\
      \ changed, update UI or log changes\n    std::cout << \"Recipe progression updated!\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using a member-wise comparison of all
    relevant fields in the RecipeProgressionInfo class. It's important to note that
    for performance-critical code paths, the comparison might be optimized or cached
    depending on how frequently these objects are compared.
