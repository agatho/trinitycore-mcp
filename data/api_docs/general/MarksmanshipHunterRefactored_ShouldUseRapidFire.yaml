  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: ShouldUseRapidFire
  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ShouldUseRapidFire() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the marksmanship hunter should activate Rapid Fire ability
    based on current combat state and resource management.
  description: This method evaluates various conditions to decide if the Marksmanship
    Hunter should use the Rapid Fire ability. It considers factors such as available
    focus, current target health, cooldown status of Rapid Fire, and tactical situation
    in combat. The decision-making process ensures optimal resource usage and damage
    output while maintaining proper rotation timing. This method is typically called
    during AI decision-making cycles to determine the most effective next action for
    the hunter.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should use Rapid Fire at this moment, false
    otherwise. The return value indicates whether activating Rapid Fire will improve
    overall damage output or maintain optimal combat efficiency given current game
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldUseRapidFire()) {\n    hunter->CastSpell(RAPID_FIRE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat rotation system
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::DoCombatAction() {\n    if (ShouldUseRapidFire())\
      \ {\n        UseRapidFire();\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with other\
      \ actions...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework and should be called
    frequently during combat. The implementation likely includes checks for focus
    requirements, target vulnerability, and cooldown state. Performance is critical
    as this method may be invoked multiple times per second during active combat.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context without proper validation,
    as it might return incorrect results when target or resource states are undefined.
    The method assumes valid game state and should not be used in situations where
    the hunter's current focus or target information is unreliable.
