api:
  class: BotProfiler
  method: AnalyzeSessionData
  signature: void BotProfiler::AnalyzeSessionData(ProfilingSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes profiling session data to gather performance metrics and bot behavior
    insights.
  description: The AnalyzeSessionData method processes a given ProfilingSession object
    to extract detailed performance statistics and behavioral patterns of bots within
    the session. This method is typically invoked after a bot session has been recorded,
    enabling developers and administrators to understand how bots are performing in
    terms of resource usage, execution time, and overall behavior. The analysis may
    include identifying bottlenecks, calculating average response times, and determining
    if any bots are exhibiting unusual or inefficient patterns. It's an essential
    tool for optimizing bot performance and ensuring that automated gameplay elements
    function as intended within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to a ProfilingSession object containing recorded data about
      bot activities and performance metrics during a specific session. This parameter
      must not be null, and the session should have been properly initialized with
      valid profiling data before calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Analysis
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      // ... populate session with data ...

      profiler.AnalyzeSessionData(session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Analyzing Multiple Sessions
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nstd::vector<ProfilingSession*> sessions;\n// ...\
      \ populate sessions vector with various profiling data ...\nfor (auto& sess\
      \ : sessions) {\n    profiler.AnalyzeSessionData(sess);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProfilingSession object passed in contains valid
    and complete data. It is recommended to verify session integrity before calling
    this method. The analysis may involve significant computational overhead depending
    on the amount of profiling data collected, so it should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical contexts.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the session parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or a crash. Ensure that all sessions passed to this method
    have been properly initialized and contain valid profiling data before invoking
    the analysis.
