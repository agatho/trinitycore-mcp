  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::IsRoleNeeded(BotRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific bot role is required for the current adaptive
    behavior configuration.
  description: The IsRoleNeeded method evaluates if a given bot role is currently
    necessary within the adaptive behavior manager's configuration. This method is
    typically used to decide whether to assign or activate specific roles for bots
    in a group, such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The decision is based on the
    current state of the adaptive behavior system and may consider factors like group
    composition, encounter type, or strategy settings. It does not modify any internal
    state but returns a boolean value indicating the necessity of the specified role.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot role is required in the current configuration;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Tank Role is Needed
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager behaviorManager;\nBotRole role = BotRole::TANK;\n\
      bool needed = behaviorManager.IsRoleNeeded(role);\nif (needed)\n{\n    // Assign\
      \ tank role to a bot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during group composition updates
    or encounter changes. It should be efficient as it may be invoked multiple times
    per frame during dynamic adjustments.
