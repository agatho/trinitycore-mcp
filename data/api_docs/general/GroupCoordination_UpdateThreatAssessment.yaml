  method: UpdateThreatAssessment
  signature: void GroupCoordination::UpdateThreatAssessment()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat assessment for all group members based on current combat
    state and target engagement.
  description: The UpdateThreatAssessment method recalculates and synchronizes threat
    levels among all players within a group. It evaluates each member's current threat
    contribution relative to the group's primary target, considering factors such
    as damage dealt, healing performed, and proximity to the target. This method is
    typically invoked during combat events to ensure accurate threat distribution
    and proper targeting behavior for group encounters. The updated threat data is
    used by the game engine to determine which player should be targeted next by enemies
    and to manage aggro mechanics appropriately.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    groupCoordination->UpdateThreatAssessment();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Threat Update After Damage Dealt
    code: "void OnDamageDealt(Unit* target, uint32 damage)\n{\n    // ... damage handling\
      \ logic ...\n    groupCoordination->UpdateThreatAssessment();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations to avoid
    unnecessary processing. The threat assessment is recalculated based on real-time
    combat data and may affect group dynamics including loot distribution and target
    selection.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat scenarios may cause unexpected behavior
    or performance issues. Ensure that all group members are properly initialized
    before invoking this method.
