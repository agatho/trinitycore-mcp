  class: BotActionExtended
  method: AssistPlayer
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::AssistPlayer(int bot, int playerToAssist,
    int enemy, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an AI bot to assist a player by targeting and engaging a specified
    enemy.
  description: The AssistPlayer method is used in TrinityCore's bot AI system to command
    a specific bot to assist another player by targeting and attacking a designated
    enemy. This method is typically invoked when the bot needs to engage in combat
    on behalf of or alongside a player, such as during group quests or battlegrounds.
    It takes into account the bot's current state, available actions, and the combat
    situation to determine how best to provide assistance. The timestamp parameter
    allows for synchronization of actions across multiple bots or systems, ensuring
    coordinated behavior. This method is part of the extended bot action system designed
    to enhance player experience through intelligent NPC assistance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will perform the assisting
      action.
  - name: playerToAssist
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is being assisted
      by the bot.
  - name: enemy
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the enemy target that the bot will
      attack on behalf of the player.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A timestamp value used to synchronize actions and ensure proper timing
      of bot behavior across systems or multiple bots.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object representing the completed or queued
    assist action, which can be used for further manipulation or tracking of the bot's
    behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assist Player Usage
    code: BotActionExtended action = botAI->AssistPlayer(12345, 67890, 54321, 1678886400);
    language: cpp
  - title: Assisting Player in Combat Scenario
    code: "uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);\nBotActionExtended assistAction = botAI->AssistPlayer(botGuid,\
      \ playerGuid, enemyGuid, currentTime);\n// Process the action result\nif (assistAction.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Bot is now assisting the player against the enemy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has sufficient permissions and capabilities
    to engage in combat. The timestamp parameter is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    when multiple bots are performing coordinated actions. The method may fail silently
    if the specified GUIDs do not correspond to valid entities in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that all GUIDs passed to this method are valid and refer to existing
    players or NPCs. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Avoid calling this method too frequently without proper cooldowns,
    as it may overwhelm the AI system.
