  signature: bool HunterAI::CanPlaceTrap() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter can place a trap at the current location.
  description: The CanPlaceTrap method evaluates if the hunter AI is currently able
    to deploy a trap. This check considers various game mechanics such as line of
    sight, terrain suitability, and existing trap placement restrictions. The method
    ensures that traps are only placed when it's valid for the hunter's current state
    and environment. It typically returns true when all conditions for trap placement
    are met, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter can place a trap at its current position; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (ai->CanPlaceTrap()) {\n    // Attempt to place a trap\n    ai->PlaceTrap();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with trap placement decision making
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (CanPlaceTrap()) {\n\
      \        // Proceed with trap placement logic\n        DoTrapPlacement();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Move or wait before attempting again\n        MoveToBestPosition();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the hunter's AI update cycle to determine
    if a trap can be placed. It may consider factors such as distance from target,
    line of sight to target, and whether the hunter is in combat or moving.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not used outside of the AI update context,
    as it may rely on state information that changes frequently. Also, note that even
    if this returns true, the actual trap placement might still fail due to external
    factors like cooldowns or resource limitations.
