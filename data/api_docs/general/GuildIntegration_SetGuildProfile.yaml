  signature: void GuildIntegration::SetGuildProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const GuildProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Updates or sets the guild profile data for a specified player.
  description: The SetGuildProfile method is responsible for updating or setting the
    guild profile information associated with a specific player in the TrinityCore
    database. This method allows administrators or game systems to modify player guild-related
    data such as rank, achievements, or other profile attributes. The operation typically
    involves writing changes to the database and may trigger synchronization events
    to ensure all connected realms reflect the updated information. It is commonly
    used during guild management operations, player transfers between guilds, or when
    updating player contributions and status within a guild context.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild profile is
      being updated. This value must correspond to an existing player in the database
      and typically represents the low part of the player's GUID.
  - name: profile
    description: A constant reference to a GuildProfile object containing the new
      profile data to be set for the specified player. The structure should contain
      all relevant guild-related information such as rank, achievements, contribution
      stats, and other profile-specific fields.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildProfile newProfile;

      newProfile.rank = GUILD_RANK_OFFICER;

      newProfile.achievements = 150;

      newProfile.contribution = 2500;

      GuildIntegration::SetGuildProfile(123456, newProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Guild Profile with Real Data
    code: 'uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      GuildProfile profile;

      profile.rank = GUILD_RANK_MEMBER;

      profile.achievements = player->GetAchievementMgr()->GetCompletedAchievementsCount();

      profile.contribution = player->GetGuild()->GetMemberContribution(playerId);

      GuildIntegration::SetGuildProfile(playerId, profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database writes and may involve transaction handling
    for consistency. It should be called with appropriate permission checks to ensure
    only authorized entities can modify guild profiles. The method might also trigger
    notifications or events to other subsystems that depend on guild profile data.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid playerGuid may result in undefined
    behavior or database corruption if the GUID does not correspond to an existing
    player. Always validate input parameters before calling this method, especially
    when dealing with user-provided data.
