  class: PriestAI
  method: GetMaxMana
  signature: int PriestAI::GetMaxMana()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum mana value for the priest AI instance.
  description: The GetMaxMana method returns the maximum amount of mana that the priest
    AI character can possess. This value is typically determined by the character's
    level, equipment, and any applicable buffs or debuffs. The returned integer represents
    the base maximum mana without considering temporary modifiers such as mana potions
    or spell effects. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making processes
    to determine when to cast mana-efficient spells or when to conserve resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum mana value for the priest AI character.
    This value is non-negative and reflects the character's base mana capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "int maxMana = priestAI->GetMaxMana();\nif (maxMana > 500) {\n    // Cast\
      \ powerful spells that consume significant mana\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_MIND_BLAST);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Management Decision Making
    code: "int maxMana = priestAI->GetMaxMana();\nint currentMana = priestAI->GetCurrentMana();\n\
      float manaPercentage = (float)currentMana / maxMana * 100;\n\nif (manaPercentage\
      \ > 75.0f) {\n    // Safe to use high-mana spells\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SWIFTMEND);\n\
      } else if (manaPercentage < 25.0f) {\n    // Conserve mana and use low-cost\
      \ abilities\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FLASH_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value represents the base maximum mana and does not account
    for temporary mana modifications such as buffs, debuffs, or consumables. This
    method should be called frequently in AI logic to ensure accurate mana management
    decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called on valid PriestAI instances to
    avoid undefined behavior. The returned value may change during combat if the character's
    stats are modified by spells or effects.
