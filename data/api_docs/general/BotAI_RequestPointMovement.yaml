  class: BotAI
  method: RequestPointMovement
  signature: bool BotAI::RequestPointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority priority,
    const int & position, const std::string & reason, const std::string & sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Requests a bot to move to a specified point using the given priority and
    reason.
  description: The RequestPointMovement method is used by the BotAI class to initiate
    a movement request for a player bot to navigate to a specific location. This method
    allows bots to be programmatically directed to move towards a defined point in
    the game world, which can be useful for quest completion, pathfinding, or strategic
    positioning. The movement request includes priority levels that determine how
    urgently the bot should execute the movement, as well as optional reason and source
    system identifiers for logging and debugging purposes. This method is part of
    the core bot AI functionality within TrinityCore's player bot system.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The movement priority level that determines how urgently the bot
      should execute this movement request. Higher priority movements will be processed
      before lower priority ones.
  - name: position
    description: A reference to an integer representing the target position or waypoint
      index in the bot's movement system. This typically corresponds to a specific
      location in the game world or a predefined path point.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why this movement is being requested.
      Used for logging and debugging purposes to track bot decision-making processes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: A string identifier indicating which system or module initiated this
      movement request. Helps in tracing the origin of movement commands within complex
      AI systems.
  returns: Returns true if the movement request was successfully queued or processed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the bot is currently
    busy, the position is invalid, or the priority level could not be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Request
    code: "if (botAI->RequestPointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH, 42, \"\
      Quest completion\", \"QuestHandler\")) {\n    // Movement request accepted\n\
      } else {\n    // Movement request failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Priority Handling
    code: "PlayerBotMovementPriority priority = PlayerBotMovementPriority::MEDIUM;\n\
      int targetPosition = GetNextWaypointIndex();\nstd::string reason = \"Group coordination\"\
      ;\nstd::string source = \"GroupManager\";\n\nif (botAI->RequestPointMovement(priority,\
      \ targetPosition, reason, source)) {\n    // Successfully requested movement\
      \ to next waypoint\n} else {\n    // Fallback logic for failed movement request\n\
      \    botAI->RequestPointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::LOW, 0, \"Fallback\"\
      , \"DefaultHandler\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore bot AI system
    and may interact with pathfinding algorithms to determine the optimal route to
    the requested point. The position parameter should generally correspond to a valid
    waypoint or location index within the bot's movement context. Multiple movement
    requests can be queued, with priority levels determining execution order.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the bot AI system
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the target position is valid and
    reachable before making movement requests. Repeatedly calling this method with
    high-priority movements in rapid succession could potentially overwhelm the bot's
    movement queue.
