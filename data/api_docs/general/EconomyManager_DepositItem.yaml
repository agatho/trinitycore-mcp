  class: EconomyManager
  method: DepositItem
  signature: bool EconomyManager::DepositItem(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Deposits an item into the economy manager's inventory, returning true on
    success.
  description: 'The DepositItem method is used to add a specified Item object into
    the EconomyManager''s internal storage system. This method handles the logic of
    transferring ownership or recording the item within the economy framework. It
    typically involves checking item validity, verifying that the item can be deposited,
    and updating relevant internal data structures. The operation may also trigger
    associated events or notifications depending on the implementation. Precondition:
    The Item pointer must be valid and not null. Postcondition: If successful, the
    item is added to the manager''s inventory; otherwise, it remains unchanged.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully deposited into the economy manager's
    inventory, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid item pointers, full
    inventory capacity, or other constraint violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Deposit
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (myItem != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    bool success = economyManager->DepositItem(myItem);\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        // Item successfully deposited\n    } else {\n        // Failed\
      \ to deposit item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EconomyManager has sufficient capacity to accept
    new items. It does not handle item stacking or merging logic, which may be implemented
    in higher-level functions. The method should ideally be called within a valid
    game context where player and item states are consistent.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Item pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the item before calling DepositItem. Additionally,
    ensure that the economy manager is properly initialized and accessible before
    attempting to deposit items.
