  method: SetForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag
  signature: void Map::SetForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag(uint16 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the force enabled navigation mesh filter flag for the map.
  description: This method configures a specific flag that determines whether navigation
    mesh filtering is forcibly enabled for the current map. It is used primarily in
    the context of World of Warcraft's pathfinding system to ensure that certain navigation
    meshes are always active regardless of player or NPC state. The flag parameter
    controls which navigation mesh filter is activated, allowing developers to override
    default behavior and enable specific pathfinding features.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The uint16 flag value that determines which navigation mesh filter
      is enabled. This typically corresponds to a specific filter type or category
      within the game's navigation system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Navigation Mesh Filter Flag
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      map->SetForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag(1);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects pathfinding behavior for NPCs and players, particularly
    in areas where navigation meshes are used. The flag value should be carefully
    selected to avoid conflicts with existing navigation mesh configurations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause unexpected behavior in pathfinding
    algorithms or lead to performance issues if the flag is set incorrectly. It should
    only be used when necessary for specific gameplay mechanics.
