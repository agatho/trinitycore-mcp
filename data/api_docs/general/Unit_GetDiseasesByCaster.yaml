  class: Unit
  method: GetDiseasesByCaster
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetDiseasesByCaster(int casterGUID, bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of disease effects applied by a specific caster.
  description: This method retrieves the number of disease effects (such as poison,
    disease, or curse) that have been applied to the unit by a particular caster.
    It is commonly used in game mechanics to determine how many instances of a specific
    disease effect exist on a target. The method can optionally remove the disease
    effects from the unit if the 'remove' parameter is set to true. This functionality
    is essential for managing spell effects and ensuring proper gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster that applied the disease effects. This is
      typically a player or NPC GUID, and represents the source of the disease effect.
  - name: remove
    description: If set to true, this parameter will remove all matching disease effects
      from the unit. If false, the method only counts the effects without removing
      them.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the count of disease effects applied
    by the specified caster. If no matching diseases are found, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 count = unit->GetDiseasesByCaster(playerGUID, false);

      // Returns the number of disease effects applied by playerGUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove disease effects example
    code: 'uint32 count = unit->GetDiseasesByCcaster(playerGUID, true);

      // Removes all disease effects applied by playerGUID from unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell mechanics and game
    balance systems. It may be used to determine whether a unit has specific disease
    effects applied, or to remove them for gameplay purposes. Performance considerations
    include checking multiple disease types, so it should be used carefully in loops.
  warnings: The method does not validate the casterGUID; if invalid GUIDs are passed,
    it may return unexpected results or cause errors. It's important to ensure that
    the casterGUID is valid before calling this method.
