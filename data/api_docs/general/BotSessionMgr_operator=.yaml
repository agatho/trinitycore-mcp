  method: operator=
  signature: BotSessionMgr & BotSessionMgr::operator=(const BotSessionMgr & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSessionMgr object to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotSessionMgr performs a deep copy of all
    member data from the source object to the target object. This method is typically
    used when creating a new BotSessionMgr instance based on an existing one, ensuring
    that all session-related state information is properly transferred. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation maintains consistency of bot session
    states across different instances. The operator handles memory management internally
    and ensures proper cleanup of existing resources before copying new data.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSessionMgr object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotSessionMgr object (this), allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'BotSessionMgr session1;

      // ... initialize session1 ...

      BotSessionMgr session2 = session1; // Uses assignment operator

      // session2 now contains a copy of all data from session1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Operations
    code: 'BotSessionMgr sessionA, sessionB, sessionC;

      // ... initialize sessions ...

      sessionC = sessionB = sessionA; // Chained assignment

      // All three sessions now contain the same data as sessionA'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. It should be used carefully in performance-critical
    sections as copying large session states may involve significant memory allocation
    and data transfer operations.
  warnings: When using this assignment operator, be aware that it may trigger expensive
    memory allocations if the BotSessionMgr contains substantial internal data structures.
    Also, ensure that the source object remains valid throughout the assignment operation
    to avoid undefined behavior.
