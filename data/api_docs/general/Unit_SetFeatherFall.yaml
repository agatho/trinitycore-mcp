  method: SetFeatherFall
  signature: bool Unit::SetFeatherFall(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the feather fall movement mechanic for a unit.
  description: The SetFeatherFall method controls whether a unit can perform feather
    fall movement, which allows the unit to fall slowly without taking damage. This
    is commonly used for player characters during certain abilities or spells that
    require controlled falling. The method returns true if the operation was successful,
    and false otherwise. When enabled, the unit's movement speed is adjusted to allow
    for slow falling behavior, typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the feather fall state was successfully set, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that the operation failed due to invalid
    parameters or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = player;\nbool success = unit->SetFeatherFall(true);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Feather fall enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement mechanics and
    may require specific conditions to be met. It's important to note that this functionality
    is usually associated with player-controlled units rather than NPC units.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the unit is not a player,
    as it may cause unexpected behavior or errors. Also, ensure that the unit has
    sufficient movement capabilities before enabling feather fall.
