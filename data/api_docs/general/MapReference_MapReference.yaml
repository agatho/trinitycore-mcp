documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MapReference object with default values.
  description: The MapReference constructor initializes a new instance of the MapReference
    class. This constructor sets up the internal state of the reference, typically
    establishing default values for member variables and preparing the object for
    use within the TrinityCore map system. The MapReference class is used to maintain
    references to maps in the game world, allowing for proper management of map instances
    and their relationships with other game objects. This initialization process ensures
    that the reference is in a valid state before being used in map-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MapReference Construction
    code: 'MapReference ref;

      // Creates a new MapReference object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: MapReference in Map Manager Context
    code: "class MapManager\n{\npublic:\n    void AddMapReference()\n    {\n     \
      \   MapReference ref;\n        // Use ref to manage map references\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating new map reference objects. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor in most cases as it's usually invoked during object creation
    or allocation. The constructor ensures that all internal pointers and state variables
    are properly initialized to prevent undefined behavior.
