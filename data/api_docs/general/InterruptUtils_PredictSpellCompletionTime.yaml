  class: InterruptUtils
  method: PredictSpellCompletionTime
  signature: float InterruptUtils::PredictSpellCompletionTime(Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the completion time of a spell being cast by the specified unit.
  description: The PredictSpellCompletionTime method calculates and returns the estimated
    time remaining, in seconds, until a spell currently being cast by the given caster
    unit will complete. This prediction takes into account various factors such as
    the spell's base cast time, any modifiers (like haste), and the current casting
    state of the unit. It is primarily used for gameplay mechanics that require knowledge
    of when a spell will finish, such as interrupt timing, spell queue management,
    or UI feedback. The method assumes that the caster is actively casting a spell
    and may return inaccurate results if called on a unit not in the casting state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the predicted time in seconds until the spell
    completes. Returns 0.0f if the caster is not currently casting a spell or if the
    cast time cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Completion Time
    code: "Unit* player = ...; // Assume player is casting a spell\nfloat completionTime\
      \ = InterruptUtils::PredictSpellCompletionTime(player);\nif (completionTime\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Spell is still casting, use completionTime for UI or logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Spell completes in %.2f seconds\\n\", completionTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell casting state tracking and may not account
    for all dynamic modifiers that could affect actual cast time. It should be used
    primarily for predictive purposes rather than precise timing calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit that is not currently casting a spell will
    result in a return value of 0.0f, which might be misinterpreted as an immediate
    completion if not properly checked.
