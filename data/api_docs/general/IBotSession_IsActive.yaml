  method: IsActive
  signature: bool IBotSession::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session is currently active and operational.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a bot session is in an active state,
    meaning it is currently running, connected, and able to process commands or actions.
    This method typically checks internal flags or states within the session management
    system to verify that the bot has not been terminated, suspended, or disconnected.
    It's commonly used by external systems or other components to ensure they are
    interacting with a valid and functioning bot instance before attempting operations
    that require an active session.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session is currently active and operational; otherwise,
    returns false if the session is inactive, terminated, or disconnected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Session Status
    code: "if (botSession->IsActive()) {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n   \
      \ botSession->PerformAction();\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive session\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Bot session is not active.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in a Loop for Continuous Monitoring
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (!botSession->IsActive()) {\n        std::cerr <<\
      \ \"Bot session became inactive, restarting...\" << std::endl;\n        break;\n\
      \    }\n    // Perform periodic tasks\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and should not introduce significant
    performance overhead. It's recommended to cache the result of IsActive() if checking
    it frequently in tight loops, as repeated calls may be unnecessary if the session
    state doesn't change often.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees the bot will remain
    active indefinitely; sessions can become inactive at any time due to external
    factors such as connection loss or system shutdown. Always validate session status
    before performing critical operations.
