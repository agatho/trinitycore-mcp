  class: Unit
  method: RemoveAurasDueToItemSpell
  signature: void Unit::RemoveAurasDueToItemSpell(uint32 spellId, int castItemGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes aura effects caused by a specific item spell from the unit.
  description: This method removes all aura effects that are triggered by a specific
    item spell from the target unit. It is commonly used when an item is removed from
    a character or when item effects expire, ensuring that the corresponding aura
    effects are properly cleared from the unit's aura list. The method handles both
    active and passive aura effects, making it essential for managing item-based gameplay
    mechanics in World of Warcraft. This function typically gets called during item
    removal events or when item effects wear off.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID associated with the item that triggered the aura effect.
      This represents the specific spell that caused the aura to be applied.
  - name: castItemGuid
    description: The GUID of the item that cast the spell. This parameter helps identify
      which specific item's spell effect should be removed from the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      int castItemGuid = 67890;

      target->RemoveAurasDueToItemSpell(spellId, castItemGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Unit* target = player;\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\nint castItemGuid = 67890;\n\
      if (target->HasAura(spellId)) {\n    target->RemoveAurasDueToItemSpell(spellId,\
      \ castItemGuid);\n}\n// This ensures that the aura is removed only if it exists"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with item removal or expiration
    events. It may be called multiple times for each spell associated with an item,
    depending on how many aura effects are applied. Performance considerations include
    the fact that this method may trigger a full aura refresh if the unit has multiple
    auras affected by the same spell.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method as it can lead to unexpected
    behavior if used incorrectly. The method should only be called with valid spell
    IDs and item GUIDs, otherwise it may cause issues with aura management or even
    crash the game. Also, ensure that the unit actually has auras associated with
    the specified spell before calling this function.
