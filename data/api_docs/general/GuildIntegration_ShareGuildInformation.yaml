  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ShareGuildInformation
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ShareGuildInformation(int * player, const std::string
    & topic)
documentation:
  brief: Shares guild information with a specified player for a given topic.
  description: The ShareGuildInformation method is responsible for broadcasting or
    transmitting specific guild-related data to a targeted player within the World
    of Warcraft environment. This method facilitates communication between guild systems
    and individual players, ensuring that relevant guild updates, announcements, or
    contextual information are properly disseminated. The method operates within the
    GuildIntegration class, which manages various guild-related functionalities in
    TrinityCore. It takes a pointer to a player identifier and a topic string to determine
    what information should be shared. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    real-time guild synchronization and player engagement with guild activities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the target player who will receive the guild information. The value must be
      a valid player GUID or nullptr if no player is specified.
  - name: topic
    description: A string specifying the subject or category of guild information
      being shared. Common topics might include 'guild_news', 'raid_schedule', 'member_updates',
      or other predefined guild-related categories.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ShareGuildInformation(&playerId, "guild_news");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Topic
    code: "int* targetPlayer = GetPlayerGUID();\nstd::string topic = GenerateTopicString();\n\
      if (targetPlayer != nullptr)\n{\n    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.ShareGuildInformation(targetPlayer,\
      \ topic);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal TrinityCore systems to retrieve
    and format guild data before sending it to the specified player. It may involve
    serialization of guild state information and network transmission over the game's
    protocol. The player pointer should be validated before use to prevent null dereference
    errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID is valid and the topic string does not contain
    invalid characters or exceed maximum length limits. Passing a nullptr for the
    player parameter may result in undefined behavior or silent failures depending
    on implementation details.
