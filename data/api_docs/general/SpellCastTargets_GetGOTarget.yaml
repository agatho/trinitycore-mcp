  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetGOTarget
  signature: GameObject * SpellCastTargets::GetGOTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GameObject target associated with the spell cast.
  description: The GetGOTarget method returns a pointer to the GameObject that serves
    as the target for a spell being cast. This target is typically set during the
    spell casting process when a player or creature casts a spell on a game object
    such as a door, chest, or quest objective. The returned GameObject pointer can
    be used to access properties and methods of the target object, enabling actions
    like opening doors, interacting with quest items, or triggering events based on
    the target's state. This method is commonly used in spell handlers and AI logic
    where spell effects need to be applied to specific game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject that was targeted by the spell cast, or nullptr
    if no GameObject target was specified during the casting process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Handler
    code: "void SpellHandler::HandleSpellEffect(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets\
      \ targets = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    GameObject* goTarget = targets.GetGOTarget();\n\
      \    \n    if (goTarget != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Perform action on the\
      \ target game object\n        goTarget->Use(spell->GetCaster());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Validity Before Use
    code: "void SpellAI::OnSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets targets\
      \ = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    GameObject* goTarget = targets.GetGOTarget();\n\
      \    \n    if (goTarget && goTarget->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        // Safe to\
      \ interact with the game object\n        if (goTarget->GetGOInfo()->type ==\
      \ GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR)\n        {\n            goTarget->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GameObject pointer is only valid during the spell's execution
    context. If the target GameObject is destroyed or removed from the world before
    the spell completes, the pointer may become invalid. Developers should always
    check for null returns and ensure the object remains valid before using it.
  warnings: Never assume the returned GameObject pointer is valid without checking
    for nullptr. Additionally, be cautious when modifying the target GameObject's
    state directly, as this might interfere with the spell's intended behavior or
    cause unexpected side effects in the game world.
