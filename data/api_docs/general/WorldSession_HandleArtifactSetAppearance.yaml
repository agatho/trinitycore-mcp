  signature: void WorldSession::HandleArtifactSetAppearance(WorldPackets::Artifact::ArtifactSetAppearance
    & artifactSetAppearance)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to set the appearance of an artifact item.
  description: The HandleArtifactSetAppearance method handles incoming packets from
    players attempting to change the visual appearance of their artifact items. This
    method is part of the artifact system in World of Warcraft, allowing players to
    customize how their artifacts look without altering their functional properties.
    The method validates the player's ability to modify the artifact, checks for proper
    item ownership and artifact state, and applies the requested appearance changes
    to the artifact. It ensures that only valid appearances from the player's collection
    can be applied to the artifact.
  parameters:
  - name: artifactSetAppearance
    description: A packet containing the artifact's GUID and the appearance ID to
      be set. This parameter includes information about which artifact item is being
      modified and what visual appearance should be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Artifact Appearance
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleArtifactSetAppearance(WorldPackets::Artifact::ArtifactSetAppearance&\
      \ artifactSetAppearance)\n{\n    // Validate player has the artifact\n    if\
      \ (!player->HasItemWithGuid(artifactSetAppearance.ArtifactGUID))\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    // Apply appearance to artifact\n    player->SetArtifactAppearance(artifactSetAppearance.ArtifactGUID,\
      \ artifactSetAppearance.AppearanceID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in response to a client-side UI interaction
    where players select an appearance from their artifact appearance collection.
    The method assumes that the player's session has been validated and that the artifact
    GUID corresponds to a valid artifact item owned by the player.
  warnings: Improper handling of artifact appearance changes can lead to visual inconsistencies
    or exploits where players might apply invalid appearance IDs. Always validate
    that the appearance ID exists in the player's collection before applying it.
