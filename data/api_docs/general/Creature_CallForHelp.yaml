api:
  class: Creature
  method: CallForHelp
  signature: void Creature::CallForHelp(float fRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Calls for help from nearby creatures within a specified radius.
  description: This method triggers an AI behavior where the creature broadcasts a
    call for assistance to nearby allied creatures within the given radius. The creature
    will attempt to summon nearby allies to assist in combat, typically used for triggering
    group-based responses or when the creature is under attack. This method is commonly
    employed in creature AI scripts to enable cooperative behavior during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: fRadius
    description: The radius in yards within which nearby creatures will be called
      for help. This parameter defines how far the call extends.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->CallForHelp(10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "if (creature->IsInCombat())\n{\n    creature->CallForHelp(15.0f);\n}\n\
      // This would trigger help call when creature is in combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may cause performance issues if
    called frequently or with very large radius values. It typically only works on
    creatures that have an AI script enabled and are not in a state where they're
    already calling for help.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that all nearby creatures will respond
    to the call; it depends on their AI behavior and whether they are able to react
    to the call. Also, if used in a loop or with low radius values, it may cause performance
    degradation due to frequent calls.
