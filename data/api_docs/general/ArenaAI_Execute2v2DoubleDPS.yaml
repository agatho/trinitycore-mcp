  class: ArenaAI
  method: Execute2v2DoubleDPS
  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute2v2DoubleDPS(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 2v2 double DPS arena AI behavior for a specified player.
  description: The Execute2v2DoubleDPS method implements the artificial intelligence
    logic for a 2v2 arena match where both players are focused on maximizing damage
    output. This method is typically invoked during arena combat to control NPC behavior,
    determining when and how to use abilities, manage positioning, and prioritize
    target selection. It operates under specific arena rules and mechanics, such as
    cooldown management, spell priority, and resource allocation tailored for a double
    DPS strategy. The method modifies the internal state of the ArenaAI instance based
    on player actions and game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      player within the arena team. This value is used to determine which player's
      AI logic should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Combat
    code: 'ArenaAI ai;

      int playerIndex = 0;

      ai.Execute2v2DoubleDPS(&playerIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ArenaAI instance has been properly initialized
    with valid arena data and that the specified player index is within acceptable
    bounds. It may interact with internal cooldown tracking, spell casting queues,
    and target selection logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'player' corresponds to a valid
    player in the arena team before calling this method.
