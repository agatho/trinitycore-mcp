  class: InterruptContext
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool InterruptContext::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the interrupt context is valid and can be safely used for spell
    interruption logic.
  description: The IsValid method determines whether the InterruptContext object has
    been properly initialized and contains valid data for performing spell interruption
    checks. This method verifies that all required fields are set and within acceptable
    ranges, ensuring that attempting to use this context for interrupting spells will
    not result in undefined behavior or crashes. The validation typically includes
    checking if the caster, target, and spell information are properly set, and that
    the context hasn't been corrupted or prematurely destroyed. This is particularly
    important in the context of World of Warcraft's combat system where invalid interrupt
    contexts could lead to game state inconsistencies or exploits.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt context is valid and can be safely used for
    spell interruption operations; returns false otherwise. A false return typically
    indicates that the context has not been properly initialized, contains invalid
    data, or has been marked as invalid due to game state changes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check before spell interruption
    code: "InterruptContext context;\n// ... populate context with valid data ...\n\
      if (context.IsValid()) {\n    // Safe to proceed with spell interruption logic\n\
      \    Spell::InterruptSpell(context);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid context\
      \ case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid interrupt context detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before performing any spell interruption
    operations to ensure data integrity. The implementation likely performs lightweight
    validation checks rather than complex computations, making it suitable for frequent
    calls during combat processing. It's recommended to cache the result of this check
    if the context will be used multiple times in sequence.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid context remains valid throughout the duration
    of spell execution, as game state changes can invalidate contexts. Always validate
    before use, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or callbacks
    where the original context might have been modified or destroyed.
