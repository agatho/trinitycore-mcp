documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 32-bit integer data value associated with the game object.
  description: The GetData method is used to retrieve stored integer data from a GameObjectAI
    instance. This method allows access to custom data that has been previously set
    using the SetData method. The retrieved value can be used for various game logic
    purposes such as tracking quest progress, managing state flags, or controlling
    behavior based on stored values. It's commonly used in scripted game objects where
    persistent data needs to be maintained across different AI events and updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value that represents the stored data associated with
    this GameObjectAI instance. The actual meaning of this value depends on how it
    was previously set using the SetData method.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Object State
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit MyGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n    \n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 state = GetData(0);\n        if (state == 1)\n      \
      \  {\n            // Perform some action based on stored state\n           \
      \ DoSomething();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetData for Quest Progress Tracking
    code: "class QuestGiverGO : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit QuestGiverGO(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n    \n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n \
      \       SetData(0, 0); // Initialize quest progress to 0\n    }\n    \n    void\
      \ UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n    {\n        uint32 progress = GetData(0);\n\
      \        if (progress >= 100)\n        {\n            // Quest completed\n \
      \           ActivateReward();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with SetData to maintain persistent
    state information for game objects. The parameter value passed to GetData is often
    used as an index or key to retrieve specific data values. In TrinityCore, GameObjectAI
    instances may have multiple data slots that can be accessed using different indices.
  warnings: Be cautious when using GetData without first ensuring that the data has
    been properly initialized with SetData. Accessing uninitialized data may result
    in unpredictable behavior. Also note that this method returns a copy of the stored
    value, so modifications to the returned value won't affect the internal state
    unless explicitly set back using SetData.
