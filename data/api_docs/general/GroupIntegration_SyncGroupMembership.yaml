api:
  class: GroupIntegration
  method: SyncGroupMembership
  signature: void GroupIntegration::SyncGroupMembership(Group * coreGroup, uint32
    playbotGroupId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes group membership between the core TrinityCore group and a playbot
    group.
  description: The SyncGroupMembership method ensures that the player group managed
    by the core TrinityCore system is synchronized with the corresponding playbot
    group. This synchronization includes updating member lists, roles, and leadership
    status to maintain consistency between the two group representations. The method
    is typically invoked when group changes occur in the playbot system that need
    to be reflected in the core group structure. It handles both additions and removals
    of players from the group, ensuring that all group members are properly accounted
    for in both systems.
  parameters:
  - name: coreGroup
    description: Pointer to the core TrinityCore Group object that represents the
      main group in the game world
  - name: playbotGroupId
    description: Unique identifier of the playbot group that should be synchronized
      with the core group
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Synchronization
    code: 'GroupIntegration integration;

      Group* coreGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);

      integration.SyncGroupMembership(coreGroup, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing After Player Join
    code: "GroupIntegration integration;\nGroup* coreGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(player->GetGroupId());\n\
      if (coreGroup)\n{\n    integration.SyncGroupMembership(coreGroup, playbotGroup->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the core group and playbot group are properly
    initialized. It should only be called when both groups exist and have valid data.
    The synchronization process may involve multiple internal operations including
    member validation, role assignment, and leadership updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null coreGroup pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group exists before calling
    this method. Additionally, frequent calls to this method without proper throttling
    may cause performance issues during rapid group changes.
