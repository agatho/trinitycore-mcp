  method: BotProfiler
  signature: void BotProfiler::BotProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotProfiler class for tracking and analyzing
    bot behavior metrics.
  description: The BotProfiler constructor initializes a new instance of the BotProfiler
    class, setting up internal data structures and state required for profiling bot
    activities within the TrinityCore environment. This method prepares the profiler
    to collect performance data, behavior patterns, and resource usage statistics
    for AI-controlled characters (bots). The initialization typically involves allocating
    memory for tracking buffers, setting default configuration values, and preparing
    logging mechanisms. This constructor is called automatically when creating a new
    BotProfiler object, and it ensures that all necessary components are ready before
    any profiling operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a BotProfiler Instance
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      // The profiler is now initialized and ready to track bot behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs minimal initialization work. Actual profiling data
    collection begins only after calling specific profiling methods like StartProfiling()
    or when bots are actively running in the game world. This class is typically used
    internally by the TrinityCore AI system and may not be directly instantiated by
    custom modules.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    bot profiling system. The BotProfiler is usually managed automatically by the
    core AI subsystem. Improper use of this constructor without proper context may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks.
