documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current snapshot of the social event queue size
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method returns the number of pending social events
    currently queued for processing. This method provides a read-only view of the
    internal queue state without modifying it. The returned value represents the count
    of events waiting to be handled by the social event bus system. This is useful
    for monitoring system load, debugging queue behavior, or implementing queue-based
    throttling mechanisms. The method does not perform any side effects and is safe
    to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current number of events in the social event
    queue. A return value of zero indicates no pending events, while positive values
    indicate the count of queued events waiting for processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Queue Size Check
    code: "int queueSize = socialEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queueSize > 100)\n\
      {\n    // Log warning about high queue load\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning:\
      \ Social event queue has %d items\", queueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Queue Health
    code: "class SocialEventMonitor\n{\npublic:\n    void CheckQueueStatus()\n   \
      \ {\n        int snapshot = sSocialEventBus->GetQueueSnapshot();\n        if\
      \ (snapshot > 500)\n        {\n            // Trigger performance alert\n  \
      \          sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_SOCIAL_QUEUE_OVERLOAD, snapshot);\n  \
      \      }\n        else if (snapshot < 10)\n        {\n            // Log low\
      \ queue activity\n            sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Social event\
      \ queue healthy with %d items\", snapshot);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a consistent snapshot of the queue size at the time
    of call. The actual queue size may change immediately after the method returns
    due to concurrent event processing or new events being added. The implementation
    is thread-safe and does not require external synchronization.
  warnings: The returned value represents only a snapshot and may become stale quickly
    in high-throughput scenarios. For real-time monitoring, consider implementing
    periodic sampling rather than continuous polling which could impact performance.
