  class: KitingManager
  method: KitingManager
  signature: void KitingManager::KitingManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a KitingManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The KitingManager constructor initializes internal state and configuration
    for managing kiting behavior of a player bot. This method sets up necessary data
    structures and references required for the bot to perform kiting mechanics such
    as maintaining optimal distance from targets, managing movement patterns, and
    handling combat positioning. The initialization process typically involves setting
    up target tracking, movement controllers, and combat state management specific
    to the bot's player instance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this KitingManager
      will control. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance in
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic KitingManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      KitingManager kiter(myBot);

      // KitingManager is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    pointer must remain valid throughout the lifetime of the KitingManager to prevent
    dangling pointer issues. Internal state initialization may involve accessing player
    properties such as movement speed, combat stance, and target tracking capabilities.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot player object is fully initialized and
    registered with the game world before creating the KitingManager instance.
