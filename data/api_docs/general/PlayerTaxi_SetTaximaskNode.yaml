  signature: bool PlayerTaxi::SetTaximaskNode(uint32 nodeidx)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a taxi node in the player's taximask to indicate visited locations.
  description: The SetTaximaskNode method updates the player's taxi mask by marking
    a specific taxi node as visited. This is used internally by the game engine to
    track which flight paths a player has discovered or visited. The method typically
    operates on a bitmask where each bit represents a different taxi node. It may
    be called when a player discovers a new flight path, visits a taxi master, or
    completes a quest that grants access to new locations. This functionality is essential
    for the taxi system in World of Warcraft to determine which nodes are available
    for travel.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the taxi node was successfully set in the mask, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the node index is invalid or out of bounds for
    the current taxi mask size.
  examples:
  - title: Mark a taxi node as visited
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is available\nuint32 nodeIndex\
      \ = 42; // Example taxi node index\nif (player->GetTaxi().SetTaximaskNode(nodeIndex))\
      \ {\n    // Node successfully marked as visited\n    sLog->outString(\"Taxi\
      \ node %u marked as visited.\", nodeIndex);\n} else {\n    // Failed to mark\
      \ node\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to mark taxi node %u as visited.\", nodeIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal taxi system implementation and should
    typically not be called directly by external code. The taxi mask is usually managed
    automatically by the game engine when players interact with taxi masters or discover
    new flight paths. The node index must be within valid range for the current taxi
    system configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper validation may corrupt the
    player's taxi mask, leading to unexpected behavior in the taxi system. Ensure
    that the node index is valid and corresponds to an actual taxi node before calling
    this method.
