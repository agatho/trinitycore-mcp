  method: SetEventCoordinationEnabled
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventCoordinationEnabled(uint32 guildId,
    bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables event coordination for a specified guild.
  description: The SetEventCoordinationEnabled method controls whether a guild can
    participate in coordinated events such as world events, holiday celebrations,
    or other timed activities that require synchronization across multiple players.
    When enabled, the guild's members may receive notifications and be eligible to
    join coordinated activities. When disabled, these events are suppressed for the
    guild. This functionality is typically used by game masters or administrative
    systems to manage guild participation in special events.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild for which event coordination is
      being enabled or disabled. Must be a valid guild identifier that exists in the
      database.
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether event coordination should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false) for the specified guild.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Event Coordination for Guild
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventCoordinationEnabled(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Event Coordination for Guild
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventCoordinationEnabled(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal guild state flags in the database or
    cache. It may trigger notifications to guild members if event coordination is
    enabled. The change takes effect immediately for new events but does not affect
    ongoing events.
