  class: Guild
  method: GetInfo
  signature: const std::string & Guild::GetInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild's information string, which typically contains the guild's
    MOTD and other descriptive details.
  description: The GetInfo method retrieves the guild's information string, commonly
    known as the Message of the Day (MOTD) or guild description. This string is displayed
    to members when they view guild information in the game interface. The returned
    string may contain formatting characters and is typically set by the guild leader
    or officers through in-game commands or UI elements. The method does not perform
    any validation on the stored information and simply returns the raw data as it
    exists in the guild's internal storage. This information can be used for various
    purposes such as displaying guild rules, announcements, or other relevant details
    to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the guild's information
    text. The string may be empty if no information has been set by the guild leader.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display guild information
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(12345);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n  \
      \  std::string info = myGuild->GetInfo();\n    if (!info.empty())\n    {\n \
      \       // Display the guild information\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GUILD_INFO,\
      \ myGuild->GetName().c_str(), info.c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n     \
      \   sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GUILD_NO_INFO);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is a reference to internal storage and should not be
    modified directly. Modifications to the guild information should be done through
    appropriate guild management methods or database updates. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from stored data without performing any modifications.
  warnings: Be cautious when displaying the returned string in user interfaces, as
    it may contain formatting characters or special sequences that could affect display
    behavior. Always validate or sanitize content before displaying to players if
    the information comes from untrusted sources.
