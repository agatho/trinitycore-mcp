documentation:
  brief: Removes a loot roll from the player's loot list
  description: This method removes a specific LootRoll object from the player's active
    loot list. It is typically used when a player's loot decision has been finalized
    or when a loot item needs to be removed from their pending loot list. The method
    ensures that the loot roll is properly cleared from the player's internal tracking
    system, preventing further participation in the loot process for that specific
    item.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the player is actively participating
    in loot decisions. It is not thread-safe and should be used carefully within a
    single-threaded context.
