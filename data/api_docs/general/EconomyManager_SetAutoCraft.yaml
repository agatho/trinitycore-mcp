  signature: void EconomyManager::SetAutoCraft(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic crafting feature for the economy manager.
  description: The SetAutoCraft method controls whether the economy manager automatically
    crafts items based on player demand or predefined rules. This functionality is
    typically used in game systems where automated production of goods is required,
    such as in auction house systems, vendor inventories, or crafting automation.
    When enabled, the system will automatically generate and add crafted items to
    available inventory slots. When disabled, manual crafting actions are required
    for item creation. The method does not validate the state of the economy manager's
    internal systems before applying the setting.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value that determines whether automatic crafting is enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Crafting
    code: 'EconomyManager* manager = sEconomyMgr;

      manager->SetAutoCraft(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Crafting
    code: 'EconomyManager* manager = sEconomyMgr;

      manager->SetAutoCraft(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only changes the internal flag for auto crafting behavior. It
    does not trigger any immediate crafting actions; it merely sets the state that
    will be checked during future crafting operations. The economy manager may have
    additional requirements or conditions that must be met before automatic crafting
    can actually occur.
