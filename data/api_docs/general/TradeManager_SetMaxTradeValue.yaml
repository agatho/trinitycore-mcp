  class: TradeManager
  method: SetMaxTradeValue
  signature: void TradeManager::SetMaxTradeValue(uint64 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum trade value allowed for a player's current trade session.
  description: The SetMaxTradeValue method configures the upper limit on the total
    gold value that can be traded between players during an active trade session.
    This value is typically used to enforce game balance and prevent exploitation
    of high-value item trades. The method updates the internal trade manager state
    to reflect the new maximum trade value, which will be enforced during the ongoing
    trade negotiation. This setting affects only the current trade session and does
    not persist beyond the trade window's completion or cancellation.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: The maximum total gold value allowed for the current trade session.
      Must be a non-negative 64-bit integer representing the maximum amount of gold
      (in copper units) that can be exchanged between players during this trade.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Trade Value to 100 Gold
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetSession()->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->SetMaxTradeValue(1000000); // 100 gold in copper units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Maximum Trade Value Based on Player Level
    code: 'uint64 maxTradeValue = player->GetLevel() * 10000; // 100 gold per level

      TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetSession()->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->SetMaxTradeValue(maxTradeValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the TradeManager and should only
    be called when a trade session is active. The value is stored in copper units
    (1 gold = 10000 copper). This setting does not affect item-level restrictions
    or other trade validation rules beyond the maximum gold amount.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may prevent legitimate trades from completing,
    while setting it too high could enable exploitation of game economy mechanics.
    The method assumes that the provided value is valid and does not perform bounds
    checking on the input parameter.
