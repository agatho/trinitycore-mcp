  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateMetrics(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics and tracking data for the Demon Hunter AI behavior.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    various performance and behavioral metrics within the Demon Hunter AI system.
    This method typically processes time-based updates, tracks cooldowns, manages
    resource levels, and ensures that the AI's decision-making logic remains synchronized
    with the current game state. It is called regularly by the core game loop to keep
    all internal tracking mechanisms up-to-date for optimal AI behavior. The method
    uses the provided 'diff' parameter to calculate elapsed time since last update,
    which is essential for accurate timing of abilities and actions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately calculate elapsed time for cooldowns, resource regeneration,
      and other time-dependent AI behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateMetrics Usage
    code: "void Update() {\n    // Called from main game loop\n    demonHunterAI->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterCreature::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Update AI metrics first\n    demonHunterAI->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n\
      \    \n    // Then perform AI logic\n    demonHunterAI->DoAIUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the creature's main update loop
    and should not be invoked directly by external systems. The 'diff' parameter must
    represent actual elapsed time in milliseconds for accurate timing calculations.
    Performance considerations include avoiding heavy computations within this method
    to maintain smooth AI behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper game update cycle as it
    relies on accurate timing information. Incorrect diff values can cause timing-based
    abilities to behave unpredictably or fail entirely.
