  method: IsBotInEventGroup
  signature: bool GroupEventHandler::IsBotInEventGroup(const GroupEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot is currently participating in the specified group event.
  description: The IsBotInEventGroup method determines if a bot character is currently
    registered or active within a given group event. This functionality is typically
    used in TrinityCore's AI and event management systems to track bot participation
    in scripted events, raids, or other group-based activities. The method evaluates
    the internal state of the GroupEventHandler to see if the bot's presence is recorded
    for the specified event. It returns true if the bot is found in the event group,
    false otherwise. This check is essential for maintaining proper event flow and
    ensuring that bots behave correctly within group-based game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a bot character is currently participating in the specified
    group event; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (groupEventHandler.IsBotInEventGroup(event)) {\n    // Bot is currently\
      \ in the event\n    // Perform event-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking structures that maintain a
    mapping of bots to their current event participation. The implementation may involve
    checking against a set or list of active participants for the given event.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupEvent parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as an invalid event reference could lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect results.
