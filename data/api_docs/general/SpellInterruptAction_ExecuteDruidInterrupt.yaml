  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteDruidInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDruidInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the bot is a Druid and the spell
    is interruptible.
  description: The ExecuteDruidInterrupt method attempts to interrupt an enemy unit's
    ongoing spell cast by a Druid bot. It checks whether the current bot is a Druid
    class, verifies that the target unit is casting a spell, and ensures that the
    spell being cast can be interrupted. If all conditions are met, it triggers the
    interrupt action using the AI framework's built-in spell interruption mechanism.
    This method is typically used in bot AI logic to respond dynamically to enemy
    spellcasting during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and decision-making.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      is to be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast by the target unit that should be
      interrupted.
  returns: Returns an ActionResult indicating whether the interrupt was successful
    or failed. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or NOT_APPLICABLE depending
    on internal logic and conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Druid Interrupt Usage
    code: "if (SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDruidInterrupt(ai, target, spellId) ==\
      \ ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->SetTarget(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the bot has proper access to the AI framework and target
    unit. It relies on internal spell casting state checks and may not work correctly
    if the target is not in a valid spellcasting state or if the spell ID does not
    correspond to an interruptible spell.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is actually casting a spell before calling
    this method, as attempting to interrupt non-casting units may lead to undefined
    behavior. Also verify that the bot is indeed a Druid class before invoking this
    function.
