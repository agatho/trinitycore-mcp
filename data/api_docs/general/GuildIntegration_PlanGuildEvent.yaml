  class: GuildIntegration
  method: PlanGuildEvent
  signature: void GuildIntegration::PlanGuildEvent(int * player, const std::string
    & eventType, uint32 proposedTime)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a guild event with the specified event type and proposed time for
    the given player.
  description: The PlanGuildEvent method is used to propose a new guild event to be
    scheduled at a specific time. This function takes a pointer to a player identifier,
    an event type string, and a proposed timestamp. The method likely handles validation
    of the event type against known guild event types, checks if the proposed time
    is valid (e.g., not in the past), and may store or queue the event for approval
    by guild leadership. It's designed to integrate with TrinityCore's guild management
    system and typically operates within the context of World of Warcraft's guild
    mechanics where events like raids, social gatherings, or guild quests can be planned
    and coordinated among members.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is proposing the event. This value must be a valid player GUID within
      the game world.
  - name: eventType
    description: String specifying the type of guild event being planned. Valid event
      types are typically predefined in the TrinityCore codebase such as 'raid', 'guild_quest',
      'social_event', etc.
  - name: proposedTime
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the proposed time for the
      event, usually expressed as a Unix timestamp. The value should be in the future
      and within acceptable range for scheduling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Event Planning
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.PlanGuildEvent(&playerId, "raid", 1678886400); // Schedules a raid
      at Unix timestamp 1678886400'
    language: cpp
  - title: Planning a Social Guild Event
    code: 'int playerId = 54321;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.PlanGuildEvent(&playerId, "social_event", time(nullptr) + 3600); //
      Schedules a social event in one hour'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event queues and may require
    the player to have appropriate permissions or guild rank to propose events. The
    proposedTime parameter should be validated against current time to ensure it's
    not in the past. Implementation details may involve database writes for storing
    event proposals.
  warnings: Passing an invalid player GUID (e.g., zero or negative) could lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the eventType string matches predefined
    valid types, otherwise the event might be rejected silently or cause errors during
    processing.
