  signature: void LFGMgr::SetDungeon(int guid, uint32 dungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the dungeon ID for a given GUID in the LFG system
  description: The SetDungeon method assigns a specific dungeon ID to a player or
    group identified by their GUID within the Looking For Group (LFG) subsystem. This
    function is typically used during dungeon queue management to associate players
    or groups with specific dungeon instances. The method updates internal LFG data
    structures to reflect the assigned dungeon, which affects group matching, queue
    positioning, and loot distribution mechanics. It's commonly called when a player
    joins a dungeon group or when a dungeon is selected from the LFG queue.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player or group whose dungeon
      assignment is being modified. This should be a valid player or group GUID within
      the TrinityCore system.
  - name: dungeon
    description: The dungeon ID to assign to the specified GUID. This represents a
      specific dungeon instance from the game's dungeon database, typically corresponding
      to a unique identifier in the dbc files or internal dungeon tables.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Dungeon to a Player
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      lfgMgr->SetDungeon(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 1234); // Assign dungeon
      ID 1234 to player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Dungeon for a Group
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      Group* group = ...; // Get group reference

      lfgMgr->SetDungeon(group->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 5678); // Assign dungeon ID
      5678 to group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    when managing dungeon assignments. It does not validate whether the GUID exists
    or if the dungeon ID is valid - such checks are typically performed by higher-level
    functions in the LFG queue management system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID or dungeon ID can lead to undefined
    behavior or corruption of LFG data structures. Ensure that all parameters are
    validated before calling this function, especially in custom modules or scripts.
