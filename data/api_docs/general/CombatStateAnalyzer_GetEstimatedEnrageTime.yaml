  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetEstimatedEnrageTime
  signature: uint32 CombatStateAnalyzer::GetEstimatedEnrageTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the estimated time remaining until a unit's enrage
    effect expires.
  description: The GetEstimatedEnrageTime method computes the approximate duration
    in milliseconds before an enrage mechanic on a combatant will expire. This is
    typically used for AI decision-making, cooldown tracking, or visual feedback to
    players. The method relies on internal state tracking of the enrage timer and
    returns zero if no active enrage effect is present. It does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the estimated time in milliseconds
    until the enrage effect expires. If no enrage is active, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (uint32 enrageTime = analyzer.GetEstimatedEnrageTime()) {\n    // Enrage\
      \ is active, proceed with appropriate actions\n    if (enrageTime < 5000) {\n\
      \        // Less than 5 seconds remaining, consider fleeing or using defensive\
      \ abilities\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CombatStateAnalyzer has been properly initialized
    with a valid unit reference and that enrage state tracking is enabled. The returned
    value is an estimate based on internal timing mechanisms and may not reflect real-time
    changes immediately.
  warnings: Do not rely on this value for precise timing calculations due to potential
    synchronization delays in the game loop. Also, ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer
    instance is associated with a valid unit before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
