  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: SetCombatProfile
  signature: void PvPCombatAI::SetCombatProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const PvPCombatProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the combat profile for a player in PvP combat.
  description: The SetCombatProfile method assigns a specific PvP combat profile to
    a player identified by their GUID. This profile defines various combat-related
    behaviors and settings that influence how the player interacts with other players
    during PvP encounters. The method typically updates internal AI state and may
    affect abilities, cooldowns, or tactical decisions made by the player's AI during
    combat. It is commonly used when initializing or switching between different PvP
    combat strategies for a player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose combat profile is
      being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: The PvPCombatProfile object containing the combat settings and behaviors
      to apply to the specified player. This includes parameters such as ability usage
      patterns, targeting preferences, and tactical decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PvPCombatProfile profile;

      profile.abilityCooldown = 3000;

      profile.targetingMode = TARGETING_MODE_AGGRESSIVE;

      PvPCombatAI ai;

      ai.SetCombatProfile(12345, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Profile Creation
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();


      PvPCombatProfile profile;

      profile.abilityCooldown = 2000;

      profile.targetingMode = TARGETING_MODE_DEFENSIVE;

      profile.useHealingPotion = true;

      profile.potionHealthThreshold = 30;


      ai.SetCombatProfile(playerGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's AI system or during player
    initialization in PvP zones. The combat profile is stored locally within the AI
    instance and affects only the specified player's behavior. Ensure that the provided
    GUID corresponds to an active player in the current world context.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting a player GUID may result in undefined behavior or
    failed profile assignment. Avoid calling this method with invalid or non-existent
    player GUIDs as it could lead to crashes or inconsistent AI behavior.
