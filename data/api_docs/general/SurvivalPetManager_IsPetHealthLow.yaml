documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player's pet health is below a specified threshold.
  description: The IsPetHealthLow method determines whether the player's current pet
    has low health, typically used in survival-based AI logic to trigger defensive
    or evasive behaviors. This method evaluates the pet's current health percentage
    against a predefined threshold, which may vary based on game mechanics or difficulty
    settings. It is commonly invoked during combat situations to assess pet viability
    and inform decision-making processes for pet management. The check considers the
    pet's maximum health and current health values to compute the percentage and compare
    it against the low-health threshold.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet's health is below the defined low-health threshold,
    otherwise returns false. This boolean value indicates whether survival-based actions
    should be triggered for the pet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (player->GetPet()->IsPetHealthLow()) {\n    // Trigger defensive behavior\
      \ or retreat\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_DEFENSIVE_STANCE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Survival AI
    code: "class SurvivalAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdatePetBehavior() {\n        if\
      \ (petManager->IsPetHealthLow()) {\n            // Prioritize healing over attacking\n\
      \            petManager->UseHealingAbility();\n        } else {\n          \
      \  // Normal combat behavior\n            petManager->AttackTarget();\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a fixed percentage threshold (e.g., 30% health) to
    determine low health status. The implementation may cache the result or perform
    calculations based on pet's current and maximum health values. It is designed
    for performance-critical AI decision-making and should not be called excessively
    in tight loops.
  warnings: The method assumes the pet exists and has valid health values. Calling
    this method without ensuring a pet is present may lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect results. This method does not account for temporary health buffs or
    debuffs that might affect the actual combat state.
