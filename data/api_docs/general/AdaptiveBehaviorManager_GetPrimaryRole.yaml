  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetPrimaryRole
  signature: BotRole AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetPrimaryRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the primary role assigned to the bot within the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetPrimaryRole method returns the BotRole enum value that represents
    the main functional role of the bot in the adaptive behavior system. This role
    determines how the bot behaves, what actions it prioritizes, and how it interacts
    with other game elements. The primary role is typically set during initialization
    or configuration of the bot and influences decision-making processes throughout
    the bot's lifecycle. This method does not modify any internal state and is read-only
    in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotRole enum value indicating the primary role of the bot. Possible values
    may include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, or SPECIALIST depending
    on the implementation details of the adaptive behavior system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotRole primaryRole = behaviorManager.GetPrimaryRole();\nif (primaryRole\
      \ == BotRole::DAMAGE_DEALER)\n{\n    // Handle damage dealer specific logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable state. The returned
    BotRole value should not be modified directly; instead, use appropriate setter
    methods or configuration functions to change the bot's role.
