  class: SoloStrategy
  method: OnDeactivate
  signature: void SoloStrategy::OnDeactivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the solo AI strategy and performs cleanup operations for the
    associated bot.
  description: The OnDeactivate method is called when a bot's solo AI strategy is
    deactivated, typically during bot removal, strategy switching, or shutdown. This
    method ensures proper cleanup of any resources or state associated with the solo
    strategy. It may reset internal flags, clear cached data, or perform other necessary
    cleanup tasks to prevent memory leaks or inconsistent behavior. The method is
    part of the bot AI lifecycle management and is invoked by the core bot framework
    when transitioning away from the solo strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance associated with this strategy. This
      parameter provides access to the bot's AI context, including its current state,
      target information, and other relevant data needed for proper deactivation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in strategy deactivation
    code: "void SoloStrategy::OnDeactivate(BotAI* ai)\n{\n    // Reset any active\
      \ flags\n    ai->SetFlag(BotAI::FLAG_IS_USING_SOLO_STRATEGY, false);\n    \n\
      \    // Clear cached target information\n    ai->ClearTarget();\n    \n    //\
      \ Perform any necessary cleanup\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore bot AI framework
    during strategy transitions. Developers should ensure that all resources allocated
    during OnActivate are properly released in this method to avoid memory leaks.
