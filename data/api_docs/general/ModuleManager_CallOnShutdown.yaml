  signature: void ModuleManager::CallOnShutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all registered shutdown callbacks in the module manager.
  description: The CallOnShutdown method executes all registered shutdown callbacks
    that have been previously added to the ModuleManager. This method is typically
    called during server shutdown to allow modules to perform cleanup operations,
    release resources, or save state information. It ensures that all modules are
    notified in a controlled manner before the server terminates. The method does
    not take any parameters and does not return a value, making it a simple notification
    mechanism for module cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server shutdown
    code: "void World::UpdateWorld()\n{\n    // ... other code ...\n    if (sWorld->GetUptime()\
      \ > sWorld->getConfig(CONFIG_UINT32_SHUTDOWN_TIME))\n    {\n        sModuleManager->CallOnShutdown();\n\
      \        // Proceed with shutdown\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during server shutdown sequence.
    It's important to ensure that all modules register their shutdown callbacks before
    this method is called. The order in which callbacks are executed is not guaranteed
    and depends on internal module registration order.
