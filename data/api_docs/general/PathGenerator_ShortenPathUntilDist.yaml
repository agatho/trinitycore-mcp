  method: ShortenPathUntilDist
  signature: void PathGenerator::ShortenPathUntilDist(const int & target, float dist)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the generated path to shorten it until a specified distance threshold
    is reached.
  description: The ShortenPathUntilDist method modifies an existing path generated
    by the PathGenerator to reduce its length such that the total distance from the
    start of the path to the new endpoint is less than or equal to the provided distance
    value. This method is typically used in navigation systems to ensure paths do
    not exceed certain length constraints, which can be important for performance
    or game logic reasons. It operates on a pre-existing path and adjusts it in-place
    without recalculating the entire route. The target parameter likely refers to
    a specific point or index within the path that marks where the shortening should
    begin or end, while dist specifies the maximum allowed distance from the start
    of the path.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific point or index in the
      path to use as reference for shortening. This could be a node index or a target
      waypoint.
  - name: dist
    description: A floating-point value specifying the maximum allowed distance from
      the start of the path. The path will be shortened so that its total length does
      not exceed this distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Shorten Path to 10 Units
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has a valid path

      pathGen.ShortenPathUntilDist(5, 10.0f); // Shortens the path until it reaches
      10 units from start'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Path Adjustment Based on Distance
    code: 'float maxDistance = player->GetMap()->GetVisibilityDistance();

      pathGen.ShortenPathUntilDist(0, maxDistance);

      // Ensures the path does not exceed visibility distance for performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid path has already been generated and stored
    within the PathGenerator instance. It modifies the internal path data structure
    directly. Performance-wise, this operation is generally efficient as it only involves
    trimming the end of the path rather than recalculating segments.
  warnings: Ensure that the target index provided is valid and corresponds to a point
    in the existing path; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or cause runtime errors.
    Also, if dist is set too low relative to the current path length, the resulting
    path might become invalid or empty.
