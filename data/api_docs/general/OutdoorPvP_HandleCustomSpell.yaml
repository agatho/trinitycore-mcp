documentation:
  brief: Handles custom spell effects for outdoor PvP objects and players
  description: The HandleCustomSpell method processes custom spell interactions within
    OutdoorPvP zones, typically triggered when a player casts a spell on a specific
    GameObject. This method is responsible for executing zone-specific spell effects
    that are not handled by standard spell systems. It evaluates whether the spell
    can be applied to the given GameObject and player context, potentially modifying
    the outdoor PvP state or triggering related events. The method returns true if
    the spell was successfully processed, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object initiating the spell. Must not be null
      and must be within the OutdoorPvP zone.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast. Should correspond to a valid spell
      in the game database that is intended for outdoor PvP use cases.
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject on which the spell is being cast. Must
      be a valid GameObject within the OutdoorPvP zone and support custom spell interactions.
  returns: Returns true if the custom spell was successfully processed and applied
    to the GameObject and player context, false if the spell could not be handled
    or failed validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Handling
    code: "if (outdoorPvP->HandleCustomSpell(player, 12345, gameObject)) {\n    //\
      \ Spell was processed successfully\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Spell\
      \ effect applied!\");\n} else {\n    // Spell processing failed\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Spell could not be cast.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Outdoor PvP Spell Logic
    code: "bool result = outdoorPvP->HandleCustomSpell(player, 67890, go);\nif (result\
      \ && player->GetTeamId() == TEAM_ALLIANCE) {\n    // Apply alliance-specific\
      \ effects\n    outdoorPvP->ApplyAllianceEffect(go);\n} else if (result && player->GetTeamId()\
      \ == TEAM_HORDE) {\n    // Apply horde-specific effects\n    outdoorPvP->ApplyHordeEffect(go);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell casting events within OutdoorPvP
    zones. It's crucial that GameObjects and Players are validated before calling
    this function to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific OutdoorPvP zone type (e.g., Wintergrasp, Ashran).
  warnings: Ensure that both player and GameObject parameters are valid pointers before
    invoking this method. Passing null pointers will likely cause a crash. Also, be
    aware that spellId must correspond to a valid spell that is designed for outdoor
    PvP usage.
