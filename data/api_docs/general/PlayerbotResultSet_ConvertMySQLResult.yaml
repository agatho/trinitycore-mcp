  class: PlayerbotResultSet
  method: ConvertMySQLResult
  signature: int * PlayerbotResultSet::ConvertMySQLResult(int * mysqlResult)
documentation:
  brief: Converts a MySQL result set into a player bot result set format for processing.
  description: The ConvertMySQLResult method takes an existing MySQL result set and
    transforms it into a structured player bot result set that can be used by the
    TrinityCore AI system. This conversion process ensures compatibility between raw
    database query results and the internal data structures required for player bot
    decision-making logic. The method handles the mapping of MySQL row data to appropriate
    player bot data types and maintains proper memory management during the transformation.
    It is typically invoked after executing a database query within the context of
    player bot AI operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer array representing the converted player
    bot result set. The array contains structured data that can be processed by subsequent
    AI routines. Returns NULL if the conversion fails or if the input MySQL result
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ConvertMySQLResult
    code: "PlayerbotResultSet* resultSet = new PlayerbotResultSet();\nint* mysqlResult\
      \ = new int[10];\n// ... populate mysqlResult with data ...\nint* botResult\
      \ = resultSet->ConvertMySQLResult(mysqlResult);\nif (botResult != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Process the converted result\n    // ... use botResult ...\n    delete[]\
      \ botResult;\n}\ndelete[] mysqlResult;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the input MySQL result is properly formatted and
    contains valid data. Memory management is handled internally, but callers should
    be aware of ownership semantics when dealing with returned pointers. Performance
    may vary depending on the size of the input result set.
  warnings: This method should not be called with NULL or invalid MySQL result pointers
    as it will likely cause undefined behavior. Ensure proper initialization and validation
    of input data before calling this function.
