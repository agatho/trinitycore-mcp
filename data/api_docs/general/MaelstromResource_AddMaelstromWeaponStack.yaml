  method: AddMaelstromWeaponStack
  signature: void MaelstromResource::AddMaelstromWeaponStack()
documentation:
  brief: Increases the Maelstrom weapon stack count by one.
  description: The AddMaelstromWeaponStack method increments the internal stack counter
    for Maelstrom weapons, which is typically used in conjunction with abilities like
    Storm, Earth, and Fire or other elemental-based attacks that consume or build
    up Maelstrom resources. This method likely modifies an internal state variable
    within the MaelstromResource class to reflect the increased stack count. The behavior
    may be tied to player actions such as casting spells or using abilities that generate
    Maelstrom energy. It is commonly used in the context of shaman class gameplay
    where Maelstrom is a resource that accumulates through certain spell casts.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MaelstromResource* maelstrom = player->GetMaelstromResource();

      maelstrom->AddMaelstromWeaponStack();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's Maelstrom resource management
    system and may trigger visual effects or updates to the UI when stacks are added.
    It is assumed that this method does not perform any validation on stack limits,
    which might be handled elsewhere in the codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when appropriate for gameplay mechanics;
    calling it outside of valid spell or ability contexts may lead to incorrect resource
    accumulation or unexpected behavior.
