  method: UpdateBoot
  signature: void LFGMgr::UpdateBoot(int guid, bool accept)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG boot status for a player based on their acceptance or rejection
    of a queued group.
  description: The UpdateBoot method handles the logic for processing a player's response
    to a LFG (Looking For Group) boot vote. When a player votes to boot another member
    from a group, this method updates the internal state of the LFG manager to reflect
    whether the boot was accepted or rejected. It ensures that the boot process is
    properly tracked and managed within the context of group matching and queue systems.
    This method typically operates in conjunction with other LFG management functions
    and may trigger further actions such as removing a player from a group or updating
    the group's status.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is voting on the boot.
      This represents the player making the decision to accept or reject the boot.
  - name: accept
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the player accepts the boot vote.
      True means the boot is accepted, false means it's rejected.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Accept a LFG Boot Vote
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->UpdateBoot(123456, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Reject a LFG Boot Vote
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->UpdateBoot(789012, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    when handling player votes during a boot process. It does not directly modify
    player data but rather updates the state of the LFG manager's boot tracking mechanism.
