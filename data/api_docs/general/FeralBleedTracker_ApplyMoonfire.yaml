  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: ApplyMoonfire
  signature: void FeralBleedTracker::ApplyMoonfire(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Moonfire spell effect to a target with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyMoonfire method is used to apply the Moonfire spell effect
    to a target unit identified by its GUID. This method sets up the necessary tracking
    and application logic for the Moonfire debuff, which typically deals periodic
    nature damage over time. The duration parameter controls how long the effect will
    persist on the target. This functionality is commonly used in feral druid spell
    handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply Moonfire
      to. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Moonfire effect will remain
      active on the target. Must be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Moonfire Application
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyMoonfire(12345, 12000); // Apply Moonfire to unit with GUID 12345
      for 12 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Duration Application
    code: 'uint32 spellDuration = 15000; // 15 seconds

      FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyMoonfire(playerGuid, spellDuration); // Apply Moonfire with dynamic
      duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core combat system to register the
    spell effect and schedule periodic damage ticks. The FeralBleedTracker class appears
    to be part of a druid-specific spell handling module that manages various bleed
    and debuff effects.
  warnings: Ensure the GUID parameter refers to an existing unit, as applying effects
    to invalid targets may cause undefined behavior. The duration should be validated
    to prevent extremely long or zero-duration applications.
