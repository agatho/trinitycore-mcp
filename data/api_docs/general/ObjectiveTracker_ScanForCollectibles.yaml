api:
  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ScanForCollectibles
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::ScanForCollectibles(Player * bot, uint32 itemId,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for collectible items within a specified radius around the player and
    returns the count of found items.
  description: The ScanForCollectibles method searches for collectible items in the
    vicinity of a given player character within a defined radius. It is typically
    used by AI systems or quest tracking mechanisms to identify nearby collectible
    objects such as rare drops, treasures, or quest-related items. The method iterates
    through the surrounding area and checks if any items match the specified item
    ID. It returns an integer representing how many of those items were found within
    the given radius. This functionality is essential for automated quest completion
    systems and helps determine whether a player has gathered all necessary collectibles
    in their current location.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the scan. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the collectible item to search for. Used to
      filter results and identify specific items of interest.
  - name: radius
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) from the player's position to scan for
      collectible items. Defines the search area.
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of collectible items found within
    the specified radius. Returns zero if no matching items are located.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find rare gems
    code: int count = objectiveTracker.ScanForCollectibles(player, 12345, 10.0f);
      // Scans for item ID 12345 within 10 yards
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic radius based on player level
    code: "float radius = player->GetLevel() > 60 ? 20.0f : 10.0f;\nint foundItems\
      \ = objectiveTracker.ScanForCollectibles(player, 98765, radius);\nif (foundItems\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Proceed with quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive depending on the number of nearby
    objects and should not be called too frequently in tight loops. The scan is performed
    synchronously, blocking execution until completion. It relies on the game's internal
    object tracking system to locate items.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method; otherwise,
    it will result in undefined behavior or crash. Avoid using very large radius values
    as they can significantly impact performance.
