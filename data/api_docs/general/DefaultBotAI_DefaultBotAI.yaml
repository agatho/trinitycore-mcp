  class: DefaultBotAI
  method: DefaultBotAI
  signature: void DefaultBotAI::DefaultBotAI(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DefaultBotAI instance for the specified player
  description: The DefaultBotAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence
    behavior for a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up
    the core AI systems, establishes player references, and prepares the bot for execution
    of default AI routines. The initialization process includes configuring basic
    bot parameters, setting up internal state management, and ensuring proper integration
    with the game's AI subsystem. This constructor is typically invoked when a new
    bot character is created or loaded into the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that this AI instance will control.
      Must be a valid player reference, cannot be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new DefaultBotAI instance
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = new Player();

      DefaultBotAI* botAI = new DefaultBotAI(botPlayer);

      // Bot AI is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during bot creation or loading phases.
    The player parameter must be fully initialized before passing to this constructor.
    The AI system will automatically register itself with the game's AI manager upon
    construction.
  warnings: Passing a null player pointer to this constructor will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all player objects are properly constructed
    and valid before initialization.
