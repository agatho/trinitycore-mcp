  signature: void QuestTurnIn::SelectQuestReward(Player * bot, uint32 questId, uint32
    rewardIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a quest reward for the specified player and quest.
  description: The SelectQuestReward method is used to process and apply a selected
    reward for a completed quest. It takes a player object, a quest identifier, and
    a reward index to determine which reward option the player has chosen from the
    available rewards. This method typically handles the logic of awarding items,
    experience, money, or other rewards based on the player's selection. The method
    is part of the quest turn-in process in TrinityCore, ensuring that the correct
    reward is given according to the player's choice.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is turning
      in the quest and selecting a reward.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the reward is being selected.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: rewardIndex
    description: Index of the reward option chosen by the player. This index corresponds
      to the order of rewards listed in the quest's reward data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Selecting a Quest Reward for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 rewardIndex = 0;

      QuestTurnIn::SelectQuestReward(player, questId, rewardIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has completed the quest and is eligible
    to receive a reward. It does not perform any validation on whether the quest is
    actually complete or if the reward index is valid; such checks should be handled
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the quest is complete or that
    the reward index is valid may result in incorrect behavior or errors. Ensure proper
    state checking and error handling in your calling code.
