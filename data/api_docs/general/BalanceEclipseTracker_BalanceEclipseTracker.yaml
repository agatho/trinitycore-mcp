  signature: void BalanceEclipseTracker::BalanceEclipseTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BalanceEclipseTracker class.
  description: The BalanceEclipseTracker constructor initializes the internal state
    of the eclipse tracking system for a player. This class is responsible for managing
    the balance between light and shadow effects in the game, particularly for druids
    who can enter eclipse states. The constructor sets up default values for tracking
    eclipse progress, current eclipse state, and associated timers or counters needed
    to determine when eclipse conditions are met or changed. It ensures that all member
    variables are properly initialized before any gameplay logic attempts to use them.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BalanceEclipseTracker instance
    code: 'BalanceEclipseTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use in eclipse state management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object initialization, typically
    when a player's character is created or loaded. It does not perform any complex
    operations but ensures all internal tracking variables are set to their default
    states.
