documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the item level of an item based on its template, bonus
    data, and various game parameters.
  description: The GetItemLevel method calculates and returns the effective item level
    of an item by considering multiple factors including the item's template, bonus
    data, player's level, fixed level, minimum and maximum item levels, PvP bonus
    status, and Azerite power level. This method is crucial for determining item quality
    and progression within World of Warcraft's item system, particularly when items
    are generated through various means such as loot, crafting, or quest rewards.
    It ensures that items are properly leveled according to game mechanics and player
    progression.
  parameters:
  - name: itemTemplate
    description: Pointer to the ItemTemplate structure which defines the base properties
      of the item including its item level, quality, and other characteristics.
  - name: bonusData
    description: Reference to BonusData structure that contains information about
      bonuses applied to the item such as enchantment levels, gem bonuses, and other
      bonus effects.
  - name: level
    description: The current player level used to determine item level adjustment
      based on player progression.
  - name: fixedLevel
    description: Fixed item level value that overrides standard item level calculations
      when specified, typically used for items with fixed level requirements.
  - name: minItemLevel
    description: Minimum item level allowed for the item, ensuring it does not fall
      below this threshold regardless of other factors.
  - name: minItemLevelCutoff
    description: Minimum item level cutoff value used to determine if an item should
      be adjusted based on player level or other conditions.
  - name: maxItemLevel
    description: Maximum item level allowed for the item, ensuring it does not exceed
      this threshold regardless of other factors.
  - name: pvpBonus
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the item should receive PvP bonus
      adjustments based on player's PvP rating or related factors.
  - name: azeriteLevel
    description: Azerite power level that affects item level calculation, particularly
      relevant for items with Azerite powers and their progression.
  returns: Returns the calculated item level of the item as a uint32 value. This value
    represents the effective item level after all adjustments have been made based
    on the provided parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Level Calculation
    code: uint32 itemLevel = item->GetItemLevel(itemTemplate, bonusData, playerLevel,
      fixedLevel, minItemLevel, minItemLevelCutoff, maxItemLevel, pvpBonus, azeriteLevel);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Item Level Calculation with Azerite
    code: uint32 itemLevel = item->GetItemLevel(itemTemplate, bonusData, playerLevel,
      0, 1, 1, 100, true, 5);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is primarily used during item generation and calculation processes.
    It requires careful handling of parameters to ensure accurate item level calculations.
    Performance considerations include potential overhead from multiple parameter
    checks and adjustments.
  warnings: Improper handling of parameters can lead to incorrect item levels, which
    may affect gameplay balance and progression. The method should be used carefully
    when calculating items for different player levels or when dealing with Azerite
    items.
