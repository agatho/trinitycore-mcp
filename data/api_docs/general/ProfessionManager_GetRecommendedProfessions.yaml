  signature: int ProfessionManager::GetRecommendedProfessions(uint8 classId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the recommended professions for a specified class in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetRecommendedProfessions method returns an integer value representing
    the set of professions recommended for a given player class. This functionality
    is used within TrinityCore to determine which crafting and gathering skills should
    be suggested to players based on their class. The returned value typically encodes
    multiple profession IDs using bit flags or similar mechanisms, allowing for efficient
    storage and retrieval of profession recommendations. The method does not take
    any parameters beyond the internal class identifier and is designed to provide
    static profession recommendations based on game balance and class-specific mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the recommended professions for the specified
    class. This value is typically a bitmask or encoded set of profession IDs that
    can be decoded using appropriate bit manipulation or lookup functions to determine
    individual profession identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Recommended Professions for Warrior
    code: "uint8 warriorClassId = 1; // Warrior class ID\nint recommendedProfessions\
      \ = professionManager.GetRecommendedProfessions(warriorClassId);\n// Process\
      \ the returned bitmask to extract individual profession IDs\nif (recommendedProfessions\
      \ & (1 << 0)) {\n    // Profession 0 is recommended\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal class mappings and profession tables defined
    in TrinityCore's configuration files or database. It may be called during character
    creation, profession selection screens, or when generating tooltips for profession
    recommendations. The return value format suggests bit manipulation is used to
    encode multiple profession IDs efficiently.
  warnings: Developers should ensure proper handling of the returned integer as it
    likely represents a bitmask. Direct comparison with specific values without proper
    bit checking may lead to incorrect behavior. The method assumes valid class IDs
    are passed, and invalid inputs might produce undefined results.
