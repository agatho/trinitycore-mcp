documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current time falls within the active time range defined
    by the provided activity pattern.
  description: The IsCurrentlyActiveTime method evaluates if the present system time
    lies within the time window specified by the given ActivityPattern. This functionality
    is typically used in bot scheduling systems to determine if a particular activity
    should be executed based on configured time constraints. The method checks against
    the pattern's start and end times, taking into account potential day-of-week restrictions
    or recurring schedules. It returns true if the current time matches the active
    schedule criteria, false otherwise. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current system time falls within the active time range
    defined by the activity pattern; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Current Time Matches Activity Pattern
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      ActivityPattern pattern;

      pattern.startTime = 9 * 3600; // 9:00 AM

      pattern.endTime = 17 * 3600; // 5:00 PM

      bool isActive = scheduler.IsCurrentlyActiveTime(pattern);

      // Returns true if current time is between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the system's local time and does not account for timezone
    differences. The ActivityPattern object must be properly initialized with valid
    start and end times in seconds since midnight. For recurring patterns, ensure
    that the pattern's day-of-week flags are correctly set to match the current day.
