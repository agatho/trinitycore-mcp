documentation:
  brief: Destroys the performance timer instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotPerformanceTimer class is responsible for
    releasing any system resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the
    timer object. This includes cleaning up internal data structures, stopping active
    timers if applicable, and ensuring no memory leaks occur. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this method ensures proper cleanup of performance
    monitoring tools used by AI bots or automated systems. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it essential
    for maintaining clean resource management in long-running applications.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of performance timer
    code: 'IBotPerformanceTimer* timer = new IBotPerformanceTimer();

      // ... use the timer ...

      delete timer; // Triggers ~IBotPerformanceTimer()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when an
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this method unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destructor assumes that all
    child objects and resources have been properly managed before its invocation.
