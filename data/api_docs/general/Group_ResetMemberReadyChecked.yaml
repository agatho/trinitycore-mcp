documentation:
  brief: Resets the ready check status for all members of the group
  description: The ResetMemberReadyChecked method clears the ready check state for
    all players in the group, effectively removing any pending or completed ready
    checks. This is typically used when starting a new encounter or when resetting
    the group's readiness status after an encounter has concluded. The method ensures
    that all group members must re-verify their readiness before proceeding with another
    activity. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group coordination
    during dungeon, raid, or battleground encounters where player readiness is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset ready checks after encounter completion
    code: "void OnEncounterComplete()\n{\n    // Reset all member ready checks after\
      \ completing an encounter\n    _group->ResetMemberReadyChecked();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset ready checks before initiating new group activity
    code: "void StartNewDungeon()\n{\n    // Clear previous ready check states before\
      \ starting a new dungeon\n    if (Group* group = _player->GetGroup())\n    {\n\
      \        group->ResetMemberReadyChecked();\n        // Proceed with new group\
      \ activity\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the group's internal ready check tracking system
    and does not send any network messages to players. The reset only affects the
    local group state and does not communicate with other players directly. It is
    typically called internally by the core when transitioning between different encounter
    states.
  warnings: Calling this method may cause players who were previously marked as ready
    to be required to re-verify their readiness, which could disrupt gameplay flow
    if done inappropriately during active encounters or when players are engaged in
    critical activities.
