  signature: uint32 DispelInfo::GetDispellerSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID of the dispel effect that caused this DispelInfo object
    to be created.
  description: The GetDispellerSpellId method retrieves the unique identifier of the
    spell that was responsible for applying a dispel effect to a specific aura or
    buff. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's spell system to track which dispel
    spell (such as Cleanse, Abolish Poison, or Remove Curse) was used to remove an
    aura from a unit. The returned value corresponds to the SpellEntry::Id field for
    the dispelling spell. This method is typically called during aura removal events
    and provides crucial information for logging, combat analysis, and spell interaction
    tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell ID of the dispelling spell that caused
    this DispelInfo to be created. Returns 0 if no valid dispeller spell ID is set
    or if the object was not initialized with a dispel effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Removal Handler
    code: "void OnAuraRemove(Aura* aura, AuraRemoveMode mode)\n{\n    if (aura->GetCaster()\
      \ && aura->GetEffect(0))\n    {\n        DispelInfo* dispelInfo = aura->GetDispelInfo();\n\
      \        if (dispelInfo)\n        {\n            uint32 dispellerSpellId = dispelInfo->GetDispellerSpellId();\n\
      \            if (dispellerSpellId)\n            {\n                // Log the\
      \ dispel event\n                sLog->outString(\"Aura dispelled by spell ID:\
      \ %u\", dispellerSpellId);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DispelInfo object was properly initialized with
    a valid dispel spell ID. The returned value is only meaningful when the DispelInfo
    was created as a result of a successful dispel operation, typically through spell
    effects like SPELL_AURA_DISPEL_IMMUNITY or similar mechanics.
