  signature: int EssenceManager::GetOptimalEssenceLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal essence level for a player based on their
    current progression and gear.
  description: The GetOptimalEssenceLevel method determines the highest possible essence
    level that a player can currently achieve, taking into account their character's
    level, equipped items, and any applicable bonuses or restrictions. This value
    is typically used in conjunction with essence-related systems such as artifact
    powers, soulbinds, or other progression mechanics within the game. The calculation
    considers various factors including the player's current level, item upgrades,
    and any temporary buffs or debuffs that may affect essence acquisition. This method
    does not modify internal state and is safe to call multiple times without side
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the optimal essence level the player can currently
    attain. Returns 0 if no essence progression is possible or if the player's character
    data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int optimalLevel = player->GetSession()->GetEssenceManager()->GetOptimalEssenceLevel();\n\
      if (optimalLevel > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Optimal essence level: \" << optimalLevel\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Essence Upgrade Logic
    code: "EssenceManager* manager = player->GetSession()->GetEssenceManager();\n\
      int currentLevel = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_CURRENT_SOULBIND); //\
      \ Example field\nint optimalLevel = manager->GetOptimalEssenceLevel();\nif (currentLevel\
      \ < optimalLevel)\n{\n    // Proceed with essence upgrade logic\n    player->SetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_CURRENT_SOULBIND,\
      \ optimalLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal character state and may return different values
    depending on the current session data. It is recommended to cache this value if
    it's accessed frequently during gameplay loops to avoid performance overhead.
    The result should be treated as a dynamic value that changes with player progression.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned level will always be higher than the current
    essence level. In some cases, such as when a player has reached maximum essence
    capacity or is in a restricted zone, this method may return a lower value than
    expected. Always validate the result before applying any changes to player data.
