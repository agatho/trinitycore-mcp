  brief: Sets the defending team for the battlefield.
  description: The SetDefenderTeam method assigns a specific team (Alliance or Horde)
    to defend the battlefield. This method is typically used during battlefield initialization
    or when changing control of the battlefield. The team parameter should be either
    0 for Alliance or 1 for Horde. This method directly affects the battlefield's
    state and can influence player interactions, rewards, and objective captures.

  - name: team
    description: The team ID to set as defender. Valid values are 0 for Alliance and
      1 for Horde.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Defender Team to Alliance
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->SetDefenderTeam(0); // Set Alliance as defender\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Defender Team to Horde
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(5678);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->SetDefenderTeam(1); // Set Horde as defender\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during appropriate battlefield states where
    team assignment is valid. It may trigger internal state updates and event notifications
    within the battlefield system.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid team values (not 0 or 1) may result in
    undefined behavior or assertion failures. Ensure the battlefield instance is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
