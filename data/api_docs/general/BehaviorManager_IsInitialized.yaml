  signature: bool BehaviorManager::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the BehaviorManager has been properly initialized and is ready
    for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the BehaviorManager instance
    has completed its initialization process. This is typically used to ensure that
    all required resources, configurations, and internal states are properly set up
    before attempting to use behavior-related functionality. The method returns true
    if initialization has been successfully completed, and false otherwise. In TrinityCore's
    AI system, this check is crucial for preventing access to uninitialized behavior
    trees or action handlers that could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BehaviorManager has been initialized and is ready for
    use; returns false if initialization has not yet occurred or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Safe to use behavior manager\
      \ functionality\n    behaviorManager.ExecuteBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ uninitialized state\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"BehaviorManager not initialized!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization State Logging
    code: "void LogBehaviorManagerState(BehaviorManager& manager) {\n    if (manager.IsInitialized())\
      \ {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"BehaviorManager is ready for use\");\n  \
      \  } else {\n        TC_LOG_WARNING(\"ai\", \"BehaviorManager is not initialized\
      \ yet\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically performs a simple boolean check on an internal initialization
    flag. It's designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for frequent
    checks during gameplay. The implementation should ensure thread safety if the
    manager can be initialized from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling behavior-related methods before checking IsInitialized() may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify initialization status before using
    any behavior functionality.
