  class: DistanceTrigger
  method: GetDistance
  signature: float DistanceTrigger::GetDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the distance from the DistanceTrigger's position to
    the player's position.
  description: The GetDistance method computes the Euclidean distance between the
    current position of the DistanceTrigger object and the position of the associated
    player. This method is typically used in game triggers or quest systems where
    actions need to be performed based on proximity to a player. The calculation takes
    into account the 3D spatial coordinates of both entities, ensuring accurate distance
    measurement within the game world. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance in yards between the DistanceTrigger's
    position and the player's position. Returns 0.0f if either entity's position is
    invalid or undefined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Trigger
    code: "if (distanceTrigger->GetDistance() < 5.0f)\n{\n    // Player is within\
      \ 5 yards of the trigger\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Proximity-Based Dialogue Trigger
    code: "float distance = distanceTrigger->GetDistance();\nif (distance < 10.0f\
      \ && distance > 2.0f)\n{\n    // Player is within range for dialogue\n    player->SendNPCText(questGiver,\
      \ \"Hello there, traveler!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a standard 3D distance calculation using the formula
    sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2). It is optimized for frequent calls in
    game loops but may have performance implications if used excessively in tight
    loops without caching results. The method assumes valid positions for both the
    trigger and player objects.
  warnings: Ensure that the DistanceTrigger object and the associated player are properly
    initialized before calling this method, as it may return unexpected values or
    cause crashes if either entity's position is invalid. Avoid using this method
    in performance-critical sections without considering caching strategies.
