documentation:
  brief: Applies bonus list modifications to the item based on the provided bonus
    list ID.
  description: The AddBonuses method is used to apply a set of bonuses to an Item
    object using a specified bonus list ID. This functionality is integral to how
    World of Warcraft items receive their magical properties, enchantments, and stat
    modifications. The method typically integrates with the game's item bonus system,
    which allows for dynamic application of various effects such as increased damage,
    armor rating, or other attribute boosts. It is commonly invoked during item creation,
    randomization, or when applying specific enchantments or upgrades to items.
  parameters:
  - name: bonusListID
    description: The unique identifier for the bonus list that defines which bonuses
      should be applied to this item. This ID corresponds to entries in the game's
      bonus list database and determines the specific effects, such as stat increases
      or special abilities, that will be added to the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a Bonus List to an Item
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 15); // Get equipped weapon\nif (item)\n\
      {\n    item->AddBonuses(12345); // Apply bonus list with ID 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Bonuses Based on Item Quality
    code: "Item* newItem = player->AddItem(itemTemplate, 1);\nif (newItem)\n{\n  \
      \  uint32 bonusListID = itemTemplate->BonusListID;\n    if (bonusListID > 0)\n\
      \        newItem->AddBonuses(bonusListID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the Item object and may affect
    its appearance, stats, or behavior in the game world. It is typically used in
    conjunction with item creation processes or when applying enchantments. The bonus
    list ID must correspond to a valid entry in the game's database; otherwise, no
    bonuses will be applied.
  warnings: Calling AddBonuses on an item that has already been modified may result
    in overwriting existing bonuses. Ensure that the bonusListID is valid and appropriate
    for the item type to avoid unexpected behavior or client-side issues.
