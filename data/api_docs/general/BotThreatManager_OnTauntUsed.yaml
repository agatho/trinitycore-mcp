  method: OnTauntUsed
  signature: void BotThreatManager::OnTauntUsed(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot uses a taunt ability on a target unit
  description: The OnTauntUsed method is invoked when a bot character successfully
    uses a taunt ability against a target unit. This method updates the threat table
    to reflect the taunt's effect, typically increasing the bot's threat level toward
    the target while potentially reducing threat from other units. The method ensures
    proper integration with the bot's AI behavior system and maintains consistency
    with World of Warcraft's threat mechanics. It is typically called internally by
    the bot's AI system when a taunt ability is executed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being taunted. Must be a valid
      unit reference, typically an enemy creature or player. The target must be within
      the bot's aggro range and not already dead.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Usage
    code: "void MyBotAI::UseTaunt(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Execute taunt ability\n        bot->CastSpell(target, TAUNT_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n        \n        // Notify threat manager of taunt usage\n      \
      \  bot->GetThreatManager()->OnTauntUsed(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotThreatManager class and should only be called
    when a legitimate taunt ability has been used. The method assumes that the taunt
    was successful and updates internal threat tracking accordingly. It does not perform
    any validation on whether the taunt actually succeeded in the game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid null pointer dereferences. This method should only be invoked after a
    successful taunt ability execution, otherwise it may cause inconsistent threat
    states in the bot's AI system.
