  class: DoorInfo
  method: DoorInfo
  signature: void DoorInfo::DoorInfo(BossInfo * _bossInfo, EncounterDoorBehavior _behavior)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DoorInfo object with specified boss information and door behavior.
  description: The DoorInfo constructor initializes a door information structure used
    in TrinityCore's encounter system. It associates a specific boss encounter with
    a particular door behavior, which determines how the door interacts during the
    encounter. This initialization is crucial for proper door handling in raid encounters
    where doors may need to be opened, closed, or destroyed based on boss health states
    or other encounter mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: _bossInfo
    description: Pointer to the BossInfo structure that defines the boss encounter
      this door belongs to. Must not be null for valid initialization.
  - name: _behavior
    description: Enumeration value specifying the door's behavior during the encounter.
      Defines how the door responds to boss state changes, such as opening when boss
      is engaged or closing when boss dies.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DoorInfo Initialization
    code: 'BossInfo* boss = &instance->GetBossInfo(0);

      DoorInfo door(boss, DOOR_BEHAVIOR_NORMAL);

      // Initializes a door that behaves normally during the first boss encounter'
    language: cpp
  - title: DoorInfo with Special Behavior
    code: 'EncounterDoorBehavior behavior = DOOR_BEHAVIOR_DESTROYED_WHEN_BOSS_DIES;

      BossInfo* boss = &instance->GetBossInfo(3);

      DoorInfo door(boss, behavior);

      // Creates a door that gets destroyed when the fourth boss dies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the encounter system.
    Developers should ensure that BossInfo pointer remains valid for the lifetime
    of the DoorInfo object. The behavior enumeration values are defined in the encounter
    system and may vary between different instance types.
  warnings: Passing a null BossInfo pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or
    crashes. Ensure all boss encounters are properly registered before creating DoorInfo
    objects. The door behavior must match the intended encounter mechanics to avoid
    unexpected door states during encounters.
