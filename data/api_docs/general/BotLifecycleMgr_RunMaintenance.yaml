documentation:
  brief: Performs periodic maintenance tasks for bot lifecycle management
  description: The RunMaintenance method executes scheduled cleanup and management
    operations for AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore environment. This includes
    handling bot state transitions, memory cleanup, resource management, and ensuring
    proper lifecycle coordination between bot instances and their associated player
    characters. The method is typically invoked by the core game loop or maintenance
    scheduler to keep bot systems running efficiently without manual intervention.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->RunMaintenance();\n\
      \    // ... continue game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the server's maintenance
    cycle. It is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, but may perform operations
    that could affect bot performance if called too frequently. The implementation
    handles thread safety internally.
