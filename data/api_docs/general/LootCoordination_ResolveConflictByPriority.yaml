  class: LootCoordination
  method: ResolveConflictByPriority
  signature: void LootCoordination::ResolveConflictByPriority(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item, const int & conflictingPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot conflict within a group by prioritizing players based on predefined
    criteria.
  description: The ResolveConflictByPriority method handles loot distribution conflicts
    that occur when multiple players have equal claim rights to an item in a group
    loot scenario. It evaluates the conflicting players and determines the rightful
    recipient according to priority rules, such as player role, loot roll outcomes,
    or other game-specific factors. This method ensures fair and consistent loot allocation
    within the group context, preventing disputes and maintaining game balance. The
    function operates on a provided group and item reference, using internal logic
    to assess and resolve the conflict.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players involved in the loot
      conflict. Must be a valid group with active members.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the item causing
      the conflict. Contains information about the item and its current loot state.
  - name: conflictingPlayers
    description: Integer value indicating the number of players involved in the loot
      conflict. Should be a positive integer representing active contenders for the
      item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group loot resolution
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item = group->GetLoot()->GetItem(0);

      int conflictingPlayers = 3;

      LootCoordination::ResolveConflictByPriority(group, item, conflictingPlayers);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group loot processing when a conflict
    arises. It assumes that the group and item references are valid and that the conflict
    has already been identified. The internal priority logic may vary depending on
    game rules or server configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as accessing invalid memory could cause crashes. Also, verify that conflictingPlayers
    is a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior during resolution.
