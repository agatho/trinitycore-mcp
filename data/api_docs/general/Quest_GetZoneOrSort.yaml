documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone or sort identifier associated with the quest.
  description: The GetZoneOrSort method returns the zone or sort identifier that corresponds
    to a specific quest. This value is used to determine the appropriate zone or sorting
    category for the quest, which affects how it is processed within the game world.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related functions
    to ensure proper quest handling and progression. It may also be relevant when
    determining quest availability based on player's current zone or level requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer identifier that corresponds to either
    a zone or sort category. This value is typically used for sorting or categorizing
    quests within the game system, and can be negative if the quest belongs to a specific
    sort category rather than a zone.
