  signature: int DistractMovementGenerator::GetMovementGeneratorType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for the distract movement
    generator.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the DistractMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used by
    the TrinityCore AI system to categorize and manage different types of movement
    behaviors for units. The method is typically called internally by the movement
    manager to determine how to process and execute specific movement patterns. It
    serves as part of the polymorphic movement generator system where each concrete
    movement generator type has a distinct integer ID for identification purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type constant for DistractMovementGenerator.
    This value is typically defined as a unique enum or constant within the MovementGeneratorType
    enumeration, commonly used to distinguish this generator from other movement types
    like TargetedMovementGenerator, WaypointMovementGenerator, etc.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "DistractMovementGenerator distractGen;\nint type = distractGen.GetMovementGeneratorType();\n\
      if (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_DISTRACT)\n{\n    // Handle distract movement\
      \ generator specifically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object
    state. The return value is typically a compile-time constant defined in the MovementGeneratorType
    enum or similar system. The implementation likely returns a predefined integer
    value that corresponds to the DistractMovementGenerator type within the movement
    system's type registry.
