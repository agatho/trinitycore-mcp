  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the LFG group coordinator is enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the Looking For Group (LFG) group
    coordinator functionality is currently enabled within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically used to verify that LFG systems are operational before
    attempting to interact with group finding or coordination features. The return
    value indicates whether the coordinator is ready to process LFG-related requests
    and manage group matching operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the LFG group coordinator is enabled and active, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the system is prepared to handle LFG group coordination
    tasks such as finding suitable players for dungeons or raids.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (LFGGroupCoordinator::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with LFG group\
      \ operations\n    sLFGMgr->Update();\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled LFG coordinator\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"LFG Coordinator is not enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or configuration settings within
    the LFG manager to determine system readiness. It's commonly used in game loop
    logic where LFG functionality needs to be conditionally enabled or disabled based
    on server settings or maintenance states.
