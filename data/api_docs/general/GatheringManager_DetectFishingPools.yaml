  class: GatheringManager
  method: DetectFishingPools
  signature: int GatheringManager::DetectFishingPools(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and returns the number of fishing pools within the specified range
    around the player.
  description: The DetectFishingPools method scans the surrounding area for valid
    fishing pool game objects within a given range. It iterates through nearby game
    objects, identifies those that are classified as fishing pools, and counts them.
    This functionality is typically used during fishing skill checks or when determining
    available fishing locations. The method relies on the player's current position
    and the defined detection range to locate applicable fishing pools in the world.
    It does not modify any game state but rather provides information about the environment
    for fishing mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid fishing pools detected
    within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no fishing pools
    were found, while a positive integer indicates the count of detectable fishing
    pools.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to detect nearby fishing pools
    code: "int poolCount = gatheringManager->DetectFishingPools(10.0f);\nif (poolCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with fishing logic\n    printf(\"Found %d fishing\
      \ pools nearby\\n\", poolCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial queries or object iteration to find game
    objects within range. Performance may be impacted by the number of game objects
    in the area, though optimized spatial indexing should mitigate this. The range
    parameter determines how far the detection extends from the player's current position.
