  method: contains
  signature: bool DynamicMapTree::contains(const GameObjectModel & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a GameObjectModel is contained within the dynamic map tree.
  description: The contains method determines whether a given GameObjectModel is fully
    enclosed by the boundaries of the dynamic map tree. This functionality is crucial
    for collision detection and spatial queries in the TrinityCore world simulation.
    The method performs a spatial containment test using the internal tree structure
    to verify if the model's bounding volume lies completely within the tree's defined
    area. It is typically used during object placement, movement validation, or spatial
    partitioning operations where it's necessary to ensure that game objects remain
    within valid map boundaries.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The GameObjectModel instance to check for containment within the
      dynamic map tree. This parameter represents a game object with a defined bounding
      volume that will be tested against the tree's spatial boundaries.
  returns: Returns true if the GameObjectModel is completely contained within the
    dynamic map tree's boundaries, false otherwise. The method returns false if the
    model extends beyond the tree's defined area or if the containment test fails
    for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic containment check
    code: "GameObjectModel model = ...; // Initialize with a game object\nif (dynamicMapTree.contains(model))\
      \ {\n    // Object is fully contained within the map tree\n    printf(\"Object\
      \ is within valid bounds\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Object extends outside of\
      \ the map tree\n    printf(\"Object is outside valid bounds\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in object placement validation
    code: "void ValidateObjectPlacement(GameObjectModel& model) {\n    if (!dynamicMapTree.contains(model))\
      \ {\n        // Log error or handle invalid placement\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      GameObject %u placed outside valid map boundaries\", model.GetId());\n     \
      \   // Potentially revert placement or adjust position\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal spatial data structure of the DynamicMapTree
    for efficient containment testing. The performance of this operation depends on
    the complexity and depth of the tree structure. For frequently accessed objects,
    consider caching results or using alternative spatial queries when performance
    is critical.
  warnings: The method assumes that the GameObjectModel parameter has been properly
    initialized with valid bounding volume data. If the model's bounds are not correctly
    set, the containment test may produce incorrect results. Additionally, this method
    does not perform any automatic correction of invalid placements - it only checks
    for containment.
