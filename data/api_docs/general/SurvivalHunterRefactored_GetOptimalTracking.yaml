  method: GetOptimalTracking
  signature: uint32 SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetOptimalTracking() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal tracking type for the survival hunter
    based on current combat state and available abilities.
  description: The GetOptimalTracking method determines the most effective tracking
    ability for a survival hunter in their current situation. This method evaluates
    factors such as target type, distance, threat level, and available tracking spells
    to return a uint32 value representing the optimal tracking type. The returned
    value typically corresponds to specific tracking abilities like 'Beast Tracking',
    'Dire Beast', or other hunter tracking mechanics. This method is crucial for AI
    decision-making in survival hunter gameplay, ensuring that the hunter uses the
    most appropriate tracking ability at any given moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the optimal tracking type. Possible
    values may include constants like TRACKING_TYPE_BEAST (for Beast Tracking), TRACKING_TYPE_DIRE_BEAST
    (for Dire Beast), or TRACKING_TYPE_NONE (when no tracking is optimal). The exact
    numeric values depend on the internal implementation and tracking system definitions
    within TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "uint32 optimalTracking = hunter.GetOptimalTracking();\nif (optimalTracking\
      \ != TRACKING_TYPE_NONE)\n{\n    // Cast the optimal tracking ability\n    hunter.CastSpell(optimalTracking);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateCombat()\n{\n    uint32 trackingType\
      \ = GetOptimalTracking();\n    if (trackingType != currentTrackingType_)\n \
      \   {\n        // Switch to optimal tracking\n        CastSpell(trackingType);\n\
      \        currentTrackingType_ = trackingType;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during combat updates and should
    be optimized for performance. The implementation may consider factors such as
    target classification (beast, humanoid, elemental), distance to target, current
    hunter resources, and cooldown states of tracking abilities.
  warnings: The return value represents an internal tracking type identifier and may
    not directly correspond to spell IDs or display names. Developers should verify
    the mapping between returned values and actual tracking spells in the TrinityCore
    codebase before using this method in conditional logic.
