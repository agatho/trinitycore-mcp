  method: IsElite
  signature: bool Creature::IsElite() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is classified as an elite mob.
  description: The IsElite method checks if a creature object is classified as an
    elite, which typically means the creature has special attributes that distinguish
    it from normal mobs. In World of Warcraft, elite creatures are usually marked
    with a gold star above their head and have increased health, damage, and experience
    rewards compared to regular creatures. This method returns true when the creature's
    entry is flagged as elite in the database, indicating that it should behave differently
    in combat and drop higher-quality loot.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is classified as an elite, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature has special elite properties that
    affect its behavior in combat and loot drops.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsElite()) {\n    // Creature is an elite\n    // Handle\
      \ special behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the creature's database entry being marked with the
    'elite' flag. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean
    check, but it should be used carefully in loops where multiple creatures are checked.
    Thread safety is not an issue for this method since it only reads data from the
    creature's internal state.
  warnings: This method does not account for dynamic changes to creature behavior
    during runtime; it only checks the original database entry. Be aware that some
    creatures may have special flags or behaviors that override normal elite classification,
    such as world bosses or rare mobs.
