documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to a trade session for the specified player.
  description: The AddItemToTrade method is responsible for adding a specific item
    to an ongoing trade session between two players. It takes the session ID, player
    GUID, item GUID, and quantity as parameters to locate and update the trade state.
    This method ensures that items are properly tracked within the trade system and
    maintains synchronization between both parties involved in the trade. The method
    operates within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, where
    trade sessions are managed through unique identifiers and player/item GUIDs.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the trade session. Used to identify which trade
      window the item should be added to.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the player who owns the item being added
      to the trade.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the specific item to be added to the
      trade session.
  - name: count
    description: Number of items to add to the trade. Must be a positive integer representing
      the quantity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: TradeSystem::AddItemToTrade(12345, 67890, 54321, 2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Items to Trade
    code: 'TradeSystem::AddItemToTrade(sessionId, playerGuid, itemGuid1, 1);

      TradeSystem::AddItemToTrade(sessionId, playerGuid, itemGuid2, 3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal trade data structures and may
    perform validation checks on the session ID and GUIDs. It's expected to be called
    during active trade negotiations between players. The implementation should ensure
    thread safety when modifying shared trade state.
  warnings: Improper use of invalid GUIDs or session IDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the item being added is valid and owned by the specified
    player before calling this method.
