  class: Player
  method: SetChosenTitle
  signature: void Player::SetChosenTitle(int32 title)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the chosen title for the player to display in their character sheet.
  description: This method allows a player to set a specific title from their collection
    of available titles. The title must be one of the titles that the player has unlocked,
    otherwise it will not be applied. This method is typically used during character
    creation or when changing titles through gameplay mechanics such as quest rewards
    or title vendors. It affects how the player's title appears on their character
    sheet and in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: title
    description: The title ID to set for the player. This should be a valid title
      ID from the player's collection of available titles. Negative values are typically
      not allowed, and invalid title IDs will result in no change being made.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a title
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetChosenTitle(123);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a title with validation
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->HasTitle(123))\n{\n    player->SetChosenTitle(123);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid title\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately update the title display in the game world;
    it may require a server-side update or client refresh to fully reflect changes.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with other title-related methods like
    GetChosenTitle() or SetTitle() to manage player titles effectively.
  warnings: The title ID must be valid and unlocked by the player, otherwise the method
    will silently fail. Be cautious when using this method during character creation
    or title changes as it may affect gameplay mechanics such as quest rewards or
    title vendors.
