  signature: float PlayerProfile::GetAverageAPM() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average actions per minute for the player profile.
  description: The GetAverageAPM method computes the average number of actions performed
    by a player per minute. This metric is commonly used in World of Warcraft to evaluate
    player engagement, activity levels, and performance during gameplay sessions.
    The calculation typically involves tracking player actions such as spell casts,
    item usage, movement commands, or other interactive events over a specified time
    period. The method returns a floating-point value representing this average, which
    can be useful for analytics, player behavior studies, or in-game reward systems
    that incentivize active play.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average actions per minute (APM) for the
    player. This value may be zero if no actions have been recorded or if the player
    has not performed any qualifying actions during the tracked period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float apm = playerProfile->GetAverageAPM();

      printf("Player''s average APM: %.2f\n", apm);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using APM in Game Logic
    code: "if (playerProfile->GetAverageAPM() > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Player is highly\
      \ active, grant bonus rewards\n    player->AddReward(RewardType::HIGH_ACTIVITY_BONUS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking mechanisms within the PlayerProfile
    class to record and compute action frequencies. It may cache results or recalculate
    based on recent activity timestamps for performance optimization.
  warnings: The returned value may not reflect real-time data if caching is implemented.
    Ensure that the player profile has sufficient recorded actions before calling
    this method for meaningful results.
