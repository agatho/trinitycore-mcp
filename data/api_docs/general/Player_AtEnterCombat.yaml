  brief: Player enters combat state when engaging in hostilities
  description: This method is called when a player begins combat with an enemy, typically
    triggered by actions such as attacking or being attacked. It initializes the combat
    state for the player and sets up necessary game mechanics including updating the
    player's combat status, enabling combat-related flags, and potentially triggering
    other combat-related events. The method ensures that the player's combat state
    is properly managed within the TrinityCore framework.

    code: "void Player::AtEnterCombat()\n{\n    // Implementation in TrinityCore\n\

    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include setting combat flags, updating player state,
    and potentially triggering combat-related events. Performance considerations are
    minimal as this is a core method that should be called infrequently.
