  class: Transport
  method: TeleportPassengersAndHideTransport
  signature: void Transport::TeleportPassengersAndHideTransport(int newMapid)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports all passengers aboard the transport to a new map and hides the
    transport from players.
  description: The TeleportPassengersAndHideTransport method is responsible for moving
    all passengers currently aboard a transport vehicle to a specified new map. This
    action effectively removes the transport from its current location and relocates
    it to the target map, while also hiding the transport object itself from player
    clients. The method ensures that all passenger units are properly teleported and
    that the transport's visibility state is updated accordingly. This functionality
    is typically used during transport movement transitions or when a transport needs
    to be relocated without being visible to players.
  parameters:
  - name: newMapid
    description: The destination map identifier where all passengers will be teleported.
      Must be a valid map ID within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Transport Teleportation
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...; // Get reference to transport

      transport->TeleportPassengersAndHideTransport(1234); // Teleport passengers
      to map ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely handles internal state management for the transport and
    its passengers, including updating passenger positions, removing transport from
    current map's object lists, and ensuring proper client-side visibility updates.
    The transport itself becomes invisible to players after this operation.
  warnings: Calling this method may cause unexpected behavior if not properly synchronized
    with the game world state. It should only be invoked during appropriate transition
    periods or when the transport is not actively serving passengers in a critical
    gameplay scenario.
