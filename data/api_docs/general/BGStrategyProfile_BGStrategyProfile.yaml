documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new battleground strategy profile with default settings.
  description: The BGStrategyProfile constructor initializes a new instance of the
    battleground strategy profile class. This method sets up internal data structures
    and default values required for managing battleground strategies, including initialization
    of player behavior patterns, objective priorities, and tactical decision-making
    parameters. The constructor ensures that all necessary components are properly
    configured before the profile can be used in battleground scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new battleground strategy profile
    code: 'BGStrategyProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default settings

      // ready to be configured for specific battleground strategies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore battleground
    system when creating new strategy profiles. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless implementing custom battleground AI logic. The initialization
    process may involve memory allocation and setup of internal data structures.
