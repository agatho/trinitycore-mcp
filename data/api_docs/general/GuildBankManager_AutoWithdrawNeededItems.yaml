documentation:
  brief: Automatically withdraws needed items from the guild bank for a specified
    player.
  description: The AutoWithdrawNeededItems method is responsible for automatically
    withdrawing required items from the guild bank for a given player. This functionality
    typically occurs when a player needs specific items for quests, crafting, or other
    in-game activities. The method processes the player's requirements and ensures
    that necessary items are withdrawn according to guild bank rules and permissions.
    It may also handle item stacking, quantity checks, and inventory management to
    prevent over-withdrawal or duplication issues. This method is generally invoked
    during player interactions with guild bank interfaces or when automatic item distribution
    systems are triggered.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's needed items should be withdrawn
      from the guild bank.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.AutoWithdrawNeededItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank data structures and
    may require proper guild permissions to execute successfully. It's designed to
    be called in contexts where automatic item distribution is needed, such as during
    quest completion or when players join guilds.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player identifier parameter could lead to incorrect
    item withdrawals or access violations. Ensure that the player GUID is valid and
    corresponds to an active player before calling this method.
