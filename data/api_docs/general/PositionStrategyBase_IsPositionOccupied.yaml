  method: IsPositionOccupied
  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::IsPositionOccupied(const int & pos, float
    radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified position is occupied by any object within the given
    radius.
  description: The IsPositionOccupied method determines whether a particular position
    in the game world is currently occupied by another object, such as a creature,
    player, or game object. It performs a spatial check using the provided position
    and radius to detect overlaps with existing entities. This functionality is commonly
    used in pathfinding, AI decision-making, and positioning logic where avoiding
    collisions or finding open spaces is required. The method returns true if any
    object exists within the specified area, and false otherwise. The check considers
    the physical dimensions of objects and their collision bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position to check for occupancy, represented as an integer identifier
      or index that maps to a specific coordinate in the game world.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius around the specified position to check for object overlap.
      Must be a positive value representing the detection range in game units.
  returns: Returns true if any object is found within the specified radius of the
    given position, indicating that the position is occupied. Returns false if no
    objects are detected within the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is free
    code: "if (!positionStrategy.IsPositionOccupied(12345, 2.0f)) {\n    // Position\
      \ is free, proceed with movement or placement\n    player->MoveTo(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI pathfinding to avoid occupied positions
    code: "float searchRadius = 3.0f;\nif (positionStrategy.IsPositionOccupied(targetPosition,\
      \ searchRadius)) {\n    // Find an alternative position\n    Position alternativePos\
      \ = findNearbyFreePosition(targetPosition, searchRadius);\n    moveTowards(alternativePos);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on spatial indexing and collision detection systems within
    TrinityCore. Performance can be impacted when checking large numbers of positions
    or with very small radius values due to frequent bounding box calculations. The
    position identifier 'pos' should map to a valid world coordinate system used internally
    by the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter correctly maps to a valid coordinate in
    the game world, otherwise behavior is undefined. Using extremely large radius
    values may cause performance degradation or unexpected results due to excessive
    overlap checks.
