  class: BotActionExtended
  method: TalkToQuestNPC
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::TalkToQuestNPC(int bot, int npc,
    uint32 questId, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a quest interaction with a specified NPC for a given bot.
  description: The TalkToQuestNPC method triggers a bot to interact with a specific
    NPC to initiate or continue a quest. It is used within the TrinityCore AI framework
    to automate quest progression for player-controlled bots. The method requires
    the bot's identifier, the NPC's identifier, and the quest ID to be provided. It
    returns a BotActionExtended object that represents the action being performed,
    allowing for chaining of AI actions or tracking of the bot's current state. This
    method is typically used in questing scripts or AI behavior trees where bots need
    to engage with NPCs to advance their quest objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the bot that will interact with the
      NPC.
  - name: npc
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the NPC that the bot will talk to for
      quest purposes.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that the bot is interacting
      with.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A timestamp value used to track when the interaction occurred, typically
      for synchronization or logging purposes.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object representing the action being performed.
    This object can be used to chain further actions or monitor the bot's current
    activity state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Interaction
    code: BotActionExtended action = bot->TalkToQuestNPC(12345, 67890, 1234, time(nullptr));
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining with Other AI Actions
    code: "BotActionExtended action = bot->TalkToQuestNPC(12345, 67890, 1234, time(nullptr))\n\
      \    .MoveTo(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has proper permissions and is within range
    of the specified NPC. The quest must be valid and available to the bot for interaction.
    The timestamp parameter can be used to implement time-based logic or prevent duplicate
    interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot, NPC, and quest IDs are valid before calling this
    method. Invalid IDs may result in silent failures or unexpected behavior. This
    method does not validate whether the bot is in a state where it can interact with
    the NPC (e.g., if it's dead or stunned).
