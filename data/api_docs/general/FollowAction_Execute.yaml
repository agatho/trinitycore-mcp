  class: FollowAction
  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult FollowAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext &
    context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the follow action for a bot AI, instructing it to follow a designated
    target.
  description: The Execute method of the FollowAction class implements the core logic
    for making a bot AI character follow a specified target within the game world.
    This action is typically used in conjunction with other AI behaviors to create
    coordinated group movement or to maintain proximity to a player or NPC. The method
    evaluates the current state of the AI and target, calculates necessary movement
    adjustments, and returns an ActionResult indicating success or failure of the
    follow operation. It may involve pathfinding, distance management, and positioning
    logic to ensure smooth and realistic following behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionResult enum value indicating whether the follow action
    was successfully executed, failed due to invalid conditions, or is still in progress.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or IN_PROGRESS depending on the outcome
    of the execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Action Execution
    code: "ActionResult result = followAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result ==\
      \ ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Bot is now following target\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot started following target\" << std::endl;\n} else if (result == ActionResult::FAILED)\
      \ {\n    // Could not initiate follow action\n    std::cout << \"Failed to start\
      \ following\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal target tracking system and requires
    that a valid target has been previously set. The implementation may involve pathfinding
    calculations which can be performance-intensive for complex environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance and context are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers or uninitialized data can cause undefined
    behavior. Also note that continuous following may consume significant CPU resources
    if not managed properly.
