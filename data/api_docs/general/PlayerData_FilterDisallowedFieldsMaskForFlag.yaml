  method: FilterDisallowedFieldsMaskForFlag
  signature: void PlayerData::FilterDisallowedFieldsMaskForFlag(int & changesMask,
    int fieldVisibilityFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Filters a field visibility mask to remove disallowed fields based on provided
    flag settings.
  description: The FilterDisallowedFieldsMaskForFlag method modifies an input changesMask
    integer by removing bits that correspond to fields which are not allowed for the
    current player's visibility settings. This is typically used in player data synchronization
    to ensure that only appropriate fields are sent to clients or processed in network
    updates. The method evaluates the fieldVisibilityFlags parameter to determine
    which fields should be excluded from the mask, effectively filtering out restricted
    or private data fields. It operates as a utility function within the PlayerData
    class for managing field-level access control during data transmission.
  parameters:
  - name: changesMask
    description: Reference to an integer mask that represents which fields have changed.
      This value is modified in-place by removing bits corresponding to disallowed
      fields.
  - name: fieldVisibilityFlags
    description: An integer flag that defines the visibility context for field filtering.
      This determines which fields are considered disallowed and thus removed from
      the changesMask.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FilterDisallowedFieldsMaskForFlag
    code: 'int mask = 0x0F; // Example mask with several fields set

      int visibilityFlags = 0x02; // Example flag setting

      playerData.FilterDisallowedFieldsMaskForFlag(mask, visibilityFlags);

      // mask now contains only allowed fields based on visibilityFlags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the changesMask parameter in-place and should be called
    before any data synchronization operations to ensure compliance with field visibility
    rules. The implementation likely relies on predefined field masks or lookup tables
    to determine which bits are disallowed.
