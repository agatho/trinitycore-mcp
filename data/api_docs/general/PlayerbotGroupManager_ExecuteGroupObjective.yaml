documentation:
  brief: Executes a group objective for the specified player bot group.
  description: The ExecuteGroupObjective method processes and applies a predefined
    group objective to a given player bot group. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore playerbot system to manage coordinated actions among multiple
    bot characters. It handles the execution logic for objectives such as gathering
    resources, completing quests, or engaging in combat scenarios that require group
    coordination. The method ensures proper synchronization of bot behaviors according
    to the defined group strategy and may involve communication between individual
    bots within the group.

  - title: Execute Group Objective for Player Bot Group
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* groupManager = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      PlayerbotGroup group = groupManager->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (group.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    groupManager->ExecuteGroupObjective(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot AI system and should only be called
    within the context of bot group management. The actual implementation details
    depend on the specific objective type assigned to the group, which may vary based
    on configuration settings and bot behavior scripts.
