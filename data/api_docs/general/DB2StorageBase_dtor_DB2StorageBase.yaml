documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DB2StorageBase instance and releases all allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DB2StorageBase class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to store and manage
    DB2 file data. This includes freeing internal data structures, releasing memory
    maps, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the storage object goes out of scope.
    In the context of TrinityCore, DB2 files contain static game data such as item
    templates, creature information, and other database-driven content that is loaded
    into memory for fast access during runtime. The destructor ensures proper cleanup
    of this data to maintain system stability and prevent resource exhaustion.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DB2 storage
    code: "void LoadGameData()\n{\n    DB2StorageBase* storage = new DB2StorageBase();\n\
      \    // ... load data into storage ...\n    delete storage; // Triggers ~DB2StorageBase()\n\
      }\n\n// Or with smart pointer\nstd::unique_ptr<DB2StorageBase> storage = std::make_unique<DB2StorageBase>();\n\
      // ... use storage ...\n// Automatically calls destructor when going out of\
      \ scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a DB2StorageBase object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    objects hold references to data managed by this storage before destruction, as
    dangling pointers could cause issues. The implementation typically handles memory
    deallocation efficiently and may include synchronization mechanisms if the storage
    is used in multi-threaded contexts.
