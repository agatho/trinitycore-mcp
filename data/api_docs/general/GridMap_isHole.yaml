  signature: bool GridMap::isHole(int row, int col) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific grid cell is marked as a hole or invalid area.
  description: The isHole method determines whether a given grid cell at the specified
    row and column coordinates is classified as a 'hole' in the GridMap. In World
    of Warcraft's context, holes typically represent areas where the terrain is not
    walkable or where there are gaps in the map geometry, such as cliffs, waterfalls,
    or other impassable regions. This method is crucial for pathfinding algorithms
    and movement validation to ensure that NPCs and players do not attempt to move
    through invalid terrain. The method performs bounds checking internally to prevent
    access violations when querying out-of-range grid coordinates.
  parameters:
  - name: row
    description: The vertical coordinate of the grid cell to check, typically representing
      a row index in the grid map structure.
  - name: col
    description: The horizontal coordinate of the grid cell to check, typically representing
      a column index in the grid map structure.
  returns: Returns true if the specified grid cell is marked as a hole or invalid
    area; otherwise returns false if the cell is walkable or valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for Holes
    code: "GridMap* map = ...;\nbool hasHole = map->isHole(10, 15);\nif (hasHole)\
      \ {\n    // Handle the case where this grid cell is a hole\n    printf(\"Cell\
      \ at (10, 15) is a hole\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using isHole in Pathfinding Logic
    code: "GridMap* map = ...;\nint startRow = 5, startCol = 5;\nint endRow = 10,\
      \ endCol = 10;\n\n// Validate that the path does not go through holes\nif (map->isHole(endRow,\
      \ endCol)) {\n    // Find an alternative route\n    printf(\"Destination is\
      \ blocked by a hole\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal movement logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Path is clear to destination\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GridMap functions
    like getArea(), getHeight(), or load(). It's important to note that grid coordinates
    are usually zero-based and correspond to the internal representation of the map
    data. The implementation may cache results for performance, especially in frequently
    accessed areas.
  warnings: Ensure that row and column values passed to this method are within valid
    bounds (typically 0 to grid size - 1) to avoid undefined behavior or access violations.
    While the method likely performs internal bounds checking, relying on it is not
    recommended for production code.
