  signature: size_t Player::GetRewardedQuestCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of quests that have been rewarded to the player.
  description: This method retrieves the number of quests that have been completed
    and rewarded to the player. It represents the total count of rewarded quests in
    the player's quest log, including those that have been completed but not yet claimed.
    The method is useful for tracking quest progress and determining how many quests
    have been successfully completed. This count includes all quests that have been
    marked as rewarded in the database, regardless of whether they were actually claimed
    by the player or not.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a size_t value representing the total number of rewarded quests
    for this player. This value corresponds to the count of quests that have been
    completed and are marked as rewarded in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'size_t rewardedCount = player->GetRewardedQuestCount();

      // This will return the number of quests that have been rewarded to the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest tracking systems
    and may be affected by database changes if quests are marked as rewarded but not
    yet claimed. Performance considerations include potential database queries when
    accessing this value, especially in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not distinguish between quests that have
    been completed but not yet claimed versus those that have been fully claimed and
    rewarded. The returned count may be higher than expected if the player has not
    yet claimed all rewards.
