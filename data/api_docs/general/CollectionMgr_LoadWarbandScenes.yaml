  brief: Loads and initializes warband scene data for the collection manager.
  description: The LoadWarbandScenes method is responsible for loading all relevant
    warband scene configurations and data into memory. This includes fetching scene
    definitions, associated rewards, and any conditional requirements that govern
    when these scenes become available to players. The method typically executes during
    server startup or when a player logs in, ensuring that the collection manager
    has up-to-date information about available warband scenes. It may also handle
    caching mechanisms to optimize performance for frequently accessed scene data.
