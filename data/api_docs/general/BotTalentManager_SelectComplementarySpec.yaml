documentation:
  brief: Selects a complementary specialization for a bot based on class and primary
    spec.
  description: The SelectComplementarySpec method determines and returns an appropriate
    secondary talent specialization for a bot character, given its class and current
    primary specialization. This is used to ensure that bots have balanced and effective
    talent builds that complement their main role. The method likely considers class-specific
    rules and game balance mechanics to avoid redundant or overly powerful combinations.
    It's typically called during bot initialization or when reconfiguring a bot's
    talents to maintain optimal gameplay performance.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier of the bot character (e.g., WARRIOR, PALADIN,
      MAGE). Valid values correspond to TrinityCore's class constants.
  - name: primarySpec
    description: The primary specialization index of the bot. This represents the
      main talent tree the bot is focused on (0 for first spec, 1 for second, etc.).
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the index of the complementary specialization.
    A value of 0 typically indicates the first spec, 1 the second, and so on. If no
    valid complementary spec exists or an error occurs, it may return an invalid index
    (e.g., 255) or throw an exception depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Selecting a complementary spec for a warrior
    code: uint8 warriorSpec = botTalentManager.SelectComplementarySpec(WARRIOR, 0);
      // Returns index of complementary warrior spec
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to configure bot talents
    code: "uint8 cls = PALADIN;\nuint8 primarySpec = 1;\nuint8 complementarySpec =\
      \ botTalentManager.SelectComplementarySpec(cls, primarySpec);\nif (complementarySpec\
      \ != 255) {\n    // Configure bot with both primary and complementary spec\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger talent management system for AI-controlled
    characters in TrinityCore. The implementation may rely on hardcoded mappings or
    dynamic calculations based on class-specific rules. Developers should be aware
    that the returned spec index must align with valid specialization indices defined
    by the game's talent system.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided class and primarySpec parameters are within valid
    ranges to avoid undefined behavior. If this method is used in a high-frequency
    context, consider caching results to prevent repeated computation of the same
    combinations.
