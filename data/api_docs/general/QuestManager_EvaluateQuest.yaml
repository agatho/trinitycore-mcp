  class: QuestManager
  method: EvaluateQuest
  signature: float QuestManager::EvaluateQuest(const Quest * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a float value representing the relative importance
    or priority of a quest within the QuestManager.
  description: The EvaluateQuest method computes and returns a floating-point score
    that indicates how significant or prioritized a given quest is within the context
    of the QuestManager. This evaluation may consider various factors such as quest
    level, reward value, player progress, quest type, or other internal metrics used
    by the TrinityCore framework to determine quest priority. The returned value can
    be used by quest handling systems to sort, filter, or prioritize quests for display
    or processing. This method does not modify any state and is typically called in
    contexts where quest prioritization logic is required, such as during quest log
    updates or automated quest recommendation systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the evaluated priority or importance of the
    quest. Higher values generally indicate higher priority or significance. The exact
    scale and interpretation of this value may depend on internal implementation details
    of the QuestManager class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine quest priority
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nfloat priority\
      \ = questManager.EvaluateQuest(quest);\nif (priority > 5.0f) {\n    // Handle\
      \ high-priority quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the quest system to determine which
    quests should be presented to players first, or how they should be weighted in
    automated systems. It's important to note that this method does not perform any
    side effects and is purely a read-only evaluation.
