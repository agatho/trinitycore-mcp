  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: GetBotHealth
  signature: HealthStatus BotHealthCheck::GetBotHealth(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the health status of a specified bot character by its GUID.
  description: The GetBotHealth method is used to determine the current health condition
    of a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts a unique identifier
    (GUID) for the bot and returns a HealthStatus enumeration that indicates whether
    the bot is healthy, low on health, or critically injured. This functionality is
    essential for AI-driven decision-making in bot behavior, such as determining when
    to retreat, seek healing, or engage in combat. The method operates within the
    context of the World of Warcraft emulation environment where bots are controlled
    by artificial intelligence scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character whose health status
      is to be retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the game
      world, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a HealthStatus enumeration indicating the current condition of
    the specified bot. Possible values include HEALTH_STATUS_NORMAL, HEALTH_STATUS_LOW,
    or HEALTH_STATUS_CRITICAL depending on the bot's current health percentage relative
    to its maximum health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthChecker;\nuint32 botGuid = 12345;\nHealthStatus status\
      \ = healthChecker.GetBotHealth(botGuid);\nif (status == HEALTH_STATUS_CRITICAL)\
      \ {\n    // Handle critical health scenario\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Health-Based AI Decision
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthChecker;\nuint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      HealthStatus status = healthChecker.GetBotHealth(botGuid);\nswitch (status)\
      \ {\n    case HEALTH_STATUS_NORMAL:\n        // Continue normal operations\n\
      \        break;\n    case HEALTH_STATUS_LOW:\n        // Initiate healing routine\n\
      \        break;\n    case HEALTH_STATUS_CRITICAL:\n        // Attempt to flee\
      \ or call for assistance\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot character exists in the game world and has
    valid health data. Performance-wise, it should be used judiciously in high-frequency
    AI decision loops as it may involve database lookups or internal state checks.
    The method is thread-safe if the underlying data structures are properly synchronized.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent bot GUID can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate that the GUID corresponds to a known bot before calling
    this method. Additionally, health status may change rapidly during combat, so
    caching results for extended periods might yield outdated information.
