  class: PhaseShift
  method: GetVisibleMapIds
  signature: const int & PhaseShift::GetVisibleMapIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of map IDs that are currently visible to the player in
    the phase shift.
  description: The GetVisibleMapIds method returns a constant reference to an integer
    array containing the identifiers of all maps currently visible to the player based
    on their current phase settings. This functionality is crucial for determining
    which areas of the game world should be rendered or accessible to a specific player.
    The returned data reflects the active phase mask and any map-specific visibility
    rules applied by the server. This method does not modify any internal state and
    can be called safely during gameplay without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer array representing the IDs of maps currently
    visible to the player in their current phase context. Each element corresponds
    to a map ID that should be rendered or considered accessible.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Visible Map IDs for Player
    code: "void ShowVisibleMaps(Player* player)\n{\n    PhaseShift& phase = player->GetPhaseShift();\n\
      \    const int& visibleMaps = phase.GetVisibleMapIds();\n    \n    for (int\
      \ mapId : visibleMaps)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Visible Map ID: \" <<\
      \ mapId << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal data structure, so modifications
    to the returned array will affect the phase shift's state. Ensure that you do
    not modify the contents of the returned array unless explicitly intended. The
    implementation may cache results for performance reasons.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve iterating through internal collections. Avoid frequent calls during
    high-frequency updates such as movement or combat events.
