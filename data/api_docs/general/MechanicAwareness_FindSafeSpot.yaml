  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: FindSafeSpot
  signature: int MechanicAwareness::FindSafeSpot(Player * bot, const AOEZone & danger,
    float minSafeDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Finds a safe location for a player to move to avoid area-of-effect danger.
  description: The FindSafeSpot method calculates and returns a suitable position
    for a bot player to move to in order to escape from an area-of-effect (AOE) threat.
    It evaluates the danger zone defined by the AOEZone parameter and identifies a
    location that maintains the specified minimum safe distance from the threat's
    center. The method is typically used in AI behavior systems where bots need to
    intelligently navigate away from harmful effects like explosions, AoE spells,
    or environmental hazards. This function considers the player's current position
    and the geometry of the danger zone to determine a viable escape path.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to find
      a safe spot. Must not be null.
  - name: danger
    description: Reference to an AOEZone object defining the area of threat. Contains
      information about the center, radius, and shape of the danger zone.
  - name: minSafeDistance
    description: Minimum distance that the bot should maintain from the center of
      the danger zone. Must be a positive value representing the safe buffer distance
      in game units.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating success or failure of the operation. A return
    value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate errors
    such as inability to find a valid spot or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nAOEZone danger = {bot->GetPosition(),\
      \ 10.0f}; // Define circular danger zone with 10-unit radius\nint result = bot->GetMechanicAwareness()->FindSafeSpot(bot,\
      \ danger, 5.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Safe spot found and bot can move\
      \ there\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Threats
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nAOEZone threat1 = {Position(100, 100, 0), 15.0f};\n\
      AOEZone threat2 = {Position(120, 120, 0), 8.0f};\n// Find safest spot considering\
      \ both threats\nint result1 = bot->GetMechanicAwareness()->FindSafeSpot(bot,\
      \ threat1, 10.0f);\nint result2 = bot->GetMechanicAwareness()->FindSafeSpot(bot,\
      \ threat2, 10.0f);\nif (result1 == 0 && result2 == 0) {\n    // Both threats\
      \ handled successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MechanicAwareness AI system and should be used
    within the context of bot behavior logic. The implementation likely uses pathfinding
    algorithms or geometric calculations to determine valid escape positions. Performance
    may vary depending on the complexity of the AOEZone shape and the surrounding
    environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null reference will cause undefined behavior. Also, make sure that the minSafeDistance
    parameter is positive; otherwise, the result might be unpredictable or invalid.
