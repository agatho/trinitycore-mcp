  class: Unit
  method: GetVirtualItemId
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetVirtualItemId(uint32 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the virtual item ID for a specified slot in the unit's inventory.
  description: The GetVirtualItemId method returns the virtual item ID associated
    with a specific slot in the unit's inventory. This method is commonly used to
    determine what item is currently equipped in a particular slot, particularly when
    dealing with virtual items or items that may not have a physical representation.
    Virtual items are often used in World of Warcraft for items that don't actually
    exist in the player's inventory but are represented as part of the game mechanics,
    such as temporary enchantments or special effects. The method is typically used
    in conjunction with other inventory-related methods to determine item properties
    and behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the virtual item ID for the specified slot, or 0 if no item is
    present in that slot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 itemId = unit->GetVirtualItemId(15); // Get virtual item ID from
      slot 15
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (unit->GetVirtualItemId(15) != 0)\n{\n    // Item exists in slot 15\n\
      \    // Perform actions based on virtual item ID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No item\
      \ in slot 15\n    // Handle empty slot case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the unit's inventory management system and should
    be used carefully when dealing with virtual items. It may return 0 for slots that
    are empty or do not contain any virtual item. Performance considerations include
    checking slot validity before calling this method, as invalid slots can cause
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid slots; invalid slot numbers
    may result in undefined behavior or return values. The method does not validate
    whether the slot actually contains a virtual item, so developers must ensure proper
    handling of empty slots.
