documentation:
  brief: Sets quest sharing information for a player's quest.
  description: This method assigns a specific quest ID to a player's quest sharing
    information, allowing the player to share quests with other players in the game
    world. It typically involves setting up the quest's GUID and ID for proper tracking
    and communication within the TrinityCore framework. The method is used primarily
    when a player begins sharing a quest with another player or when quest sharing
    is enabled for a specific quest.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will be sharing the
      quest. This represents the player's GUID in the game world.
  - name: id
    description: The quest ID that is being shared. This identifies the specific quest
      being shared between players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sharing Setup
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetQuestSharingInfo(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest sharing mechanics
    and may require proper initialization of the player's quest data before being
    called. Performance considerations include ensuring that the GUID and ID values
    are valid and properly formatted.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest tracking or invalid
    quest sharing behavior. Ensure that the GUID and ID values are valid before calling
    this method.
