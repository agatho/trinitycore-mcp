  class: QuestAcceptanceManager
  method: GetQuestsDropped
  signature: int QuestAcceptanceManager::GetQuestsDropped() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of quests dropped by the player during their current
    session.
  description: The GetQuestsDropped method returns an integer value representing the
    cumulative count of quests that have been dropped (i.e., made available for pickup)
    by the player character within the active game session. This count is typically
    used to track quest progression, manage quest availability, and enforce quest-related
    restrictions or rewards. The value is maintained internally by the QuestAcceptanceManager
    and reflects all quest drops since the last reset or session start. This method
    does not modify any state; it simply retrieves and returns the current drop count.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of quests dropped by the player
    during the current session. Returns zero if no quests have been dropped yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int droppedQuests = questAcceptanceManager.GetQuestsDropped();\nif (droppedQuests\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player has dropped \" << droppedQuests << \" quests.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest-related events or updates to
    determine how many quests the player has successfully dropped (made available)
    in their current session. It's important to note that this count may be reset
    under certain conditions such as logout, zone change, or server restart depending
    on implementation details.
