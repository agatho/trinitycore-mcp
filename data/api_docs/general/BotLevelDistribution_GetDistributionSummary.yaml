  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: GetDistributionSummary
  signature: std::string BotLevelDistribution::GetDistributionSummary() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a formatted summary string of the bot level distribution
    statistics.
  description: The GetDistributionSummary method compiles and returns a human-readable
    string that summarizes the current bot level distribution data. This method is
    typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying statistical information about
    how bots are distributed across different levels within the game environment.
    The returned string contains key metrics such as total bot count, average level,
    level ranges, and potentially other relevant statistical data. It provides a quick
    overview of the bot population's level characteristics without requiring direct
    access to internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted summary of the bot level distribution
    statistics. The string includes key metrics such as total count, average level,
    and distribution ranges in a readable format suitable for logging or display purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution distribution;

      // ... populate distribution data ...

      std::string summary = distribution.GetDistributionSummary();

      std::cout << "Bot Distribution Summary: " << summary << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations or formatting operations that may
    have performance implications if called frequently in performance-critical code
    paths. The exact format of the returned string is implementation-dependent and
    may vary between different versions of TrinityCore.
