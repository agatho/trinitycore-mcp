documentation:
  brief: Handles the quest giver dialog interaction for a player bot.
  description: The HandleQuestGiverDialog method manages the interaction between a
    player bot and a quest giver NPC, processing the quest dialog flow including quest
    acceptance, turn-in, and reward distribution. This method is typically invoked
    when a bot interacts with a quest giver to either start or complete a quest. It
    handles the internal state management of the quest progress and ensures proper
    communication with the game server for quest-related actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is interacting
      with the quest giver NPC.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC that the bot
      is interacting with.
  - name: questId
    description: The ID of the quest being processed during the dialog interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Giver Dialog Handling
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      uint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;

      uint32 questId = 67890;

      QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestGiverDialog(bot, questGiverGuid, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has proper access to the quest giver and
    that the quest data is valid within the game context. It may internally trigger
    additional events or updates related to quest progression.
