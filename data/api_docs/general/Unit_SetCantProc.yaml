documentation:
  brief: Sets the cant proc flag for the unit, preventing it from proc'ing during
    combat.
  description: The SetCantProc method is used to control whether a Unit can proc during
    combat. When applied, this flag prevents the unit from triggering any proc effects,
    such as abilities or items that have a chance to activate on hit or attack. This
    is commonly used in scenarios where certain mechanics need to be suppressed, such
    as boss encounters or specific game events where procs should not occur. The method
    affects the unit's behavior during combat and can be toggled on or off depending
    on the desired gameplay state.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\n target->SetCantProc(true);\n // Prevents\
      \ target from proc'ing during combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related flags
    to control unit behavior during encounters. It should be applied carefully as
    it affects the entire combat system of the unit.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in combat
    mechanics, especially when used in boss fights or scripted events where procs
    are expected.
