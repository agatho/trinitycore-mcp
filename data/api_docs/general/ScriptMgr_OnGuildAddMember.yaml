  class: ScriptMgr
  method: OnGuildAddMember
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnGuildAddMember(Guild * guild, Player * player, uint8
    plRank)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a player is added to a guild, allowing scripts to execute custom
    logic.
  description: The OnGuildAddMember method is a hook in the ScriptMgr class that gets
    called whenever a player joins a guild. This method provides an opportunity for
    script developers to implement custom behavior such as sending welcome messages,
    adjusting player stats, or triggering quest events. It serves as a notification
    mechanism for guild membership changes and is part of TrinityCore's scripting
    framework that allows modification of game behavior without directly altering
    core engine code. The method is executed after the player has been successfully
    added to the guild but before any additional processing occurs.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to the Guild object representing the guild to which the player
      is being added. This parameter cannot be null and represents the target guild.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is being
      added to the guild. This parameter cannot be null and represents the joining
      player.
  - name: plRank
    description: The rank level of the player within the guild, represented as a uint8
      value. This typically corresponds to predefined guild ranks such as 'Guild Master',
      'Officer', 'Member', etc., with lower values indicating higher ranks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Join Logging
    code: "void OnGuildAddMember(Guild* guild, Player* player, uint8 plRank)\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player %s joined guild %s with rank %u\", \n        player->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ guild->GetName().c_str(), plRank);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Granting Bonus Buff on Guild Join
    code: "void OnGuildAddMember(Guild* guild, Player* player, uint8 plRank)\n{\n\
      \    if (plRank == 0) // Guild Master\n    {\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 12345, true); // Grant special buff\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the core game logic during guild membership
    operations. Scripters should be aware that modifying guild data directly in this
    hook may cause inconsistencies if not handled carefully. The method is part of
    the global script manager and will be invoked for all registered scripts.
  warnings: Do not modify or delete the player or guild objects within this method,
    as doing so can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid performing heavy
    computations or blocking operations in this hook to prevent performance degradation.
