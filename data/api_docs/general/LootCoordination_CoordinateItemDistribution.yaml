documentation:
  brief: Coordinates the distribution of a loot item among players in a loot session.
  description: The CoordinateItemDistribution method manages how a specific loot item
    is allocated to players within a given loot session. It ensures that the item
    is properly handled according to the loot rules and distribution strategy, such
    as need-before-greed or free-for-all. This method typically handles the logic
    for determining which player receives the item based on the current loot state,
    player eligibility, and any applicable loot rules. The method operates within
    the context of a LootSession, which tracks all players participating in the loot
    and their respective loot preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Reference to the LootSession object that manages the current loot
      distribution state and player participation.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem object representing the specific item being
      distributed among players in the session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Distributing a loot item in a group loot session
    code: 'LootSession session;

      LootItem item;

      // ... initialize session and item ...

      LootCoordination::CoordinateItemDistribution(session, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the loot distribution phase of a
    group or raid encounter. It assumes that all players in the session are eligible
    for loot and have been properly added to the session before calling.
