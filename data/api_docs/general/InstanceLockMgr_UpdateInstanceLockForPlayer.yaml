  method: UpdateInstanceLockForPlayer
  signature: InstanceLock * InstanceLockMgr::UpdateInstanceLockForPlayer(int trans,
    const int & playerGuid, const MapDb2Entries & entries, InstanceLockUpdateEvent
    && updateEvent)
documentation:
  brief: Updates or creates an instance lock for a player based on the provided map
    entries and update event.
  description: The UpdateInstanceLockForPlayer method manages the instance lock state
    for a specific player within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a transaction
    identifier, player GUID, map database entries, and an update event to determine
    whether to create a new instance lock or modify an existing one. This method is
    typically used during player entry into instances or when instance lock states
    need to be synchronized with game events. The method ensures that player instance
    access permissions are correctly maintained according to the game's locking mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This value is
      typically a reference to an active database transaction object that ensures
      atomicity of the lock update operation.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom the instance
      lock is being updated. This GUID must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  - name: entries
    description: A reference to MapDb2Entries structure containing information about
      map entries that define which instances should be locked or unlocked for the
      player.
  - name: updateEvent
    description: An rvalue reference to an InstanceLockUpdateEvent object that specifies
      the type of update operation to perform on the instance lock, such as adding,
      removing, or modifying locks.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the updated or newly created InstanceLock object.
    If the operation fails or no lock is created, it may return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateInstanceLockForPlayer
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = instanceLockMgr->UpdateInstanceLockForPlayer(transaction,\
      \ playerGuid, mapEntries, std::move(updateEvent));\nif (lock != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Lock was successfully updated\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Instance lock\
      \ updated for player {}\", playerGuid);\n} else {\n    // Failed to update lock\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Failed to update instance lock for player {}\",\
      \ playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the database using the provided transaction. It
    is crucial that the transaction is properly managed and committed or rolled back
    after this call. The method may perform database reads and writes, so it should
    be called in a context where such operations are allowed.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid transaction can lead to database inconsistency.
    Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this function, especially
    the playerGuid which must refer to an existing player.
