  class: TargetScanner
  method: GetScanRadius
  signature: float TargetScanner::GetScanRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the scan radius used by the target scanner for detecting nearby units.
  description: The GetScanRadius method retrieves the float value representing the
    maximum distance within which the TargetScanner will search for valid targets.
    This radius is typically used in AI behavior to determine how far a creature or
    NPC should look for enemies or allies. The returned value is usually configured
    based on the scanner's type, the unit's properties, or game-defined constants.
    It is important to note that this method does not perform any dynamic calculations;
    it simply returns a pre-configured radius value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the scan radius in yards. This value defines
    the maximum distance from the scanner's position within which targets will be
    considered for selection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float radius = scanner.GetScanRadius();\n// Use radius to determine scan\
      \ range\nif (radius > 0)\n{\n    // Perform scanning logic using the radius\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class EnemyAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        float scanRadius\
      \ = targetScanner.GetScanRadius();\n        if (scanRadius > 0)\n        {\n\
      \            // Use scan radius to set up detection range\n            SetDetectionRange(scanRadius);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other TargetScanner methods
    like SetScanRadius or GetTarget. The returned value may be influenced by the scanner's
    configuration, unit type, or AI settings. It is recommended to cache this value
    if it's accessed frequently within tight loops.
