  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: UpdateGroupFormation
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::UpdateGroupFormation(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of a group within an instance coordination system.
  description: The UpdateGroupFormation method is responsible for synchronizing and
    maintaining the current formation state of a specified group within the instance
    coordination framework. This method ensures that all group members are properly
    positioned and aligned according to the instance's requirements, particularly
    in scenarios involving raid encounters or dungeon instances where positioning
    is critical. It typically handles adjustments to group member positions, orientation,
    and synchronization with instance-specific constraints such as boss encounter
    mechanics or environmental triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose formation needs to be updated.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid group within the instance.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Update group formation for active raid
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n\
      \    sInstanceCoordination->UpdateGroupFormation(raidGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance events or when group composition
    changes. It may internally trigger position recalculations and synchronization
    with the instance's spatial constraints, particularly for encounters where precise
    positioning affects gameplay outcomes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not destroyed before
    calling this method. Calling this on a group that has already been disbanded or
    removed from an instance can lead to undefined behavior.
