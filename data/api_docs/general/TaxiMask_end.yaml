  brief: Marks the end of a taxi path traversal sequence for a player
  description: The TaxiMask::end() method terminates the current taxi path traversal
    process for a player character. This method is typically invoked when a player
    has completed their journey along a taxi route or when the taxi system needs to
    clean up internal state tracking. It ensures proper cleanup of taxi-related data
    structures and may trigger associated events or updates in the game world. The
    method does not accept any parameters and performs no return operations, serving
    purely as a state management function within the taxi system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetTaxiMask()->end();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal taxi system implementation and should
    only be called when a taxi journey has concluded. It's typically invoked automatically
    by the core game engine upon successful taxi path completion.
