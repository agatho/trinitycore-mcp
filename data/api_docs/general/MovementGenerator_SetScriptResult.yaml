documentation:
  brief: Sets the script result for a movement generator, indicating the reason for
    stopping movement.
  description: The SetScriptResult method is used to notify the movement generator
    system about the reason why a movement has been stopped. This method is typically
    called internally by the core movement system when a creature or player's movement
    is interrupted or completed. It allows the system to properly handle cleanup,
    event triggering, and state management based on the specific stop reason. The
    method does not return any value but updates internal state that may be used by
    other systems in the game engine.

    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();

      mg->SetScriptResult(MovementStopReason::REACHED_DESTINATION);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and should typically
    not be called directly by custom scripts or addons. It's primarily used by the
    core TrinityCore engine to manage movement state transitions.
