  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: GetLastQueueTime
  signature: time_t LFGBotSelector::GetLastQueueTime(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the last queue time for a specified bot GUID
  description: The GetLastQueueTime method retrieves the timestamp of the last time
    a specific bot (identified by its GUID) was queued for a group finder activity.
    This method is typically used within the LFG bot system to track when bots last
    attempted to join groups, which helps in managing bot behavior and preventing
    excessive queuing. The returned time_t value represents seconds since Unix epoch
    (January 1, 1970). This information can be crucial for implementing cooldowns
    or scheduling bot queue attempts.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose last queue time is
      being retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the bot was last queued,
    or 0 if no queue record exists for the specified bot GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve last queue time for a bot
    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\ntime_t lastQueueTime = lfgBotSelector->GetLastQueueTime(botGuid);\n\
      if (lastQueueTime > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot was last queued at: \" << lastQueueTime\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No queue record found for this\
      \ bot.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses an internal data structure that stores queue
    timestamps per bot GUID. It's important to note that the returned time_t value
    may be zero if no previous queue attempt was recorded for the given bot, which
    should be handled appropriately in calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual
    bot within the system; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or
    cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware that time_t values are platform-dependent
    and may require conversion for display purposes.
