  class: ThreatReference
  method: IsOnline
  signature: bool ThreatReference::IsOnline() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the threat reference target is currently online and accessible
    in the game world.
  description: The IsOnline method determines if the target associated with this ThreatReference
    object is currently active and available within the game world. This method typically
    checks the validity of the target's session, ensuring that the player or creature
    is not disconnected, logged out, or otherwise inaccessible. It is commonly used
    in threat management systems to validate that a target can still be affected by
    threat calculations and aggro mechanics. The method returns true if the target
    is online and accessible, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference target is currently online and accessible;
    returns false if the target is offline, disconnected, or otherwise inaccessible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Reference Online Check
    code: "if (threatRef.IsOnline()) {\n    // Target is online, proceed with threat\
      \ calculations\n    threatRef.AddThreat(amount);\n} else {\n    // Target is\
      \ offline, skip threat updates\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Target\
      \ is not online, skipping threat update.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lightweight check on the target's session state
    without causing expensive database lookups. It may internally verify that the
    target object is valid and has an active connection to the server.
