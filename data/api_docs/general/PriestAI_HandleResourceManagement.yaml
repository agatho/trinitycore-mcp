  signature: bool PriestAI::HandleResourceManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Manages and optimizes the priest's resource usage during combat.
  description: The HandleResourceManagement method is responsible for controlling
    how a Priest AI character utilizes its mana and other resources during combat.
    This includes determining when to cast spells based on available mana, managing
    cooldowns, and ensuring optimal spell selection for maximum damage or healing
    output. The method evaluates the current state of the priest's resources and makes
    decisions about which abilities to use next, considering factors such as mana
    cost, spell priority, and target health. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    efficient resource allocation and preventing resource depletion during prolonged
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource management logic successfully executed and
    updated the AI's state; returns false if no action was taken or if resource management
    failed due to invalid conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Management Execution
    code: "if (priestAI->HandleResourceManagement()) {\n    // Resource management\
      \ completed successfully\n    // AI has updated its spell selection and resource\
      \ usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    if (HandleResourceManagement())\n        return;\
      \ // Resource management handled, no further action needed\n    \n    // Continue\
      \ with other AI behaviors\n    DoNextAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop and should
    be invoked frequently during combat. It's designed to work in conjunction with
    other AI decision-making methods and may influence the behavior of subsequent
    actions such as spell casting or movement. The method assumes that the priest
    has a valid target and sufficient resources to perform actions.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to resource starvation,
    where the priest runs out of mana during combat. Ensure that all spell costs are
    properly accounted for and that mana regeneration is considered when making decisions
    about spell usage.
