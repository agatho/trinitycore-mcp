  class: CalendarInvite
  method: GetNote
  signature: std::string CalendarInvite::GetNote() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the note associated with a calendar invite.
  description: The GetNote method returns the textual note that was added to a calendar
    invite by the inviting player. This note typically contains additional information
    or context about the event, such as reasons for the invitation, special instructions,
    or personal messages. The returned string may be empty if no note was provided
    when the invite was created. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft
    calendar system's ability to provide richer communication between players regarding
    scheduled events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the note text associated with the calendar invite.
    Returns an empty string if no note was set.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display calendar invite note

      \ = invite->GetNote();\nif (!note.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Invite note:\
      \ \" << note << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No note provided for\
      \ this invite.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is read-only and does not modify the internal state of the CalendarInvite
    object. It's safe to call from any thread that has access to the CalendarInvite
    instance, assuming proper synchronization mechanisms are in place for shared objects.
