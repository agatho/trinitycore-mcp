  method: SetManagerActive
  signature: bool ManagerRegistry::SetManagerActive(const std::string & managerId,
    bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates a manager identified by its unique ID within the
    registry.
  description: The SetManagerActive method is used to enable or disable a specific
    manager instance within the ManagerRegistry. This functionality allows for dynamic
    control over manager components, which can be useful for managing game systems,
    modules, or subsystems that may need to be temporarily suspended or re-enabled
    during runtime. The method takes a manager identifier and a boolean flag indicating
    whether the manager should be activated (true) or deactivated (false). It returns
    true if the operation was successful and the manager's state was updated, or false
    if the manager with the specified ID does not exist or the operation failed for
    any reason.
  parameters:
  - name: managerId
    description: A unique string identifier that represents the specific manager to
      be activated or deactivated. This ID should correspond to a valid manager registered
      within the ManagerRegistry.
  - name: active
    description: A boolean flag indicating the desired state of the manager. If true,
      the manager will be activated; if false, it will be deactivated.
  returns: Returns true if the manager with the specified ID exists and its activation
    state was successfully updated. Returns false if the manager does not exist or
    if an error occurred during the update process.
  examples:
  - title: Activate a Manager
    code: "if (managerRegistry.SetManagerActive(\"PlayerManager\", true)) {\n    //\
      \ Manager activated successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"PlayerManager has\
      \ been activated\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to activate manager\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      server\", \"Failed to activate PlayerManager\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate a Manager
    code: "bool success = managerRegistry.SetManagerActive(\"AIManager\", false);\n\
      if (success) {\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"AIManager has been deactivated\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_WARN(\"server\", \"Could not deactivate AIManager\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other manager registry
    operations such as GetManagerActive or ManagerRegistry::GetManager to provide
    full control over manager lifecycle. The implementation likely involves internal
    locking mechanisms for thread safety when managing concurrent access to managers.
  warnings: Ensure that the managerId provided corresponds to an existing registered
    manager, otherwise the method will return false without modifying any state. Be
    cautious when deactivating critical managers as this may affect core game functionality.
