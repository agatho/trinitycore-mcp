  class: CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
  method: GetFlags7
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags7() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the seventh set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags7 method returns an integer value representing the seventh
    group of static flags stored within the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder. These flags
    are typically used to define specific behavioral or visual properties of creatures
    in the World of Warcraft environment, such as AI settings, spawn conditions, or
    interaction behaviors. The returned value is a bitmask that can be interpreted
    using predefined flag constants. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the seventh set of static flags. Each bit in the
    returned value corresponds to a specific flag, which can be checked using bitwise
    operations. The exact meaning of each flag depends on the game's internal definitions
    and may vary per creature type or instance.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a specific flag is set
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\nint flags7 = flagsHolder.GetFlags7();\n\
      if (flags7 & 0x10) // Example: checking for a specific flag\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ the case where the flag is set\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging all flags for debugging purposes
    code: '#include <iostream>

      CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;

      int flags7 = flagsHolder.GetFlags7();

      std::cout << "Flags7 value: " << flags7 << " (0x" << std::hex << flags7 << ")"
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger system that manages static creature properties.
    The flag values are usually defined in the game's configuration files or database
    entries and may differ between different versions or patches of TrinityCore. It's
    recommended to consult the core documentation or source code for specific flag
    meanings.
