documentation:
  brief: Returns the talent map for the specified spec
  description: This method retrieves the PlayerTalentMap structure associated with
    a specific talent specialization. The PlayerTalentMap contains all the talent
    points and their configurations for the given spec, allowing developers to access
    and manipulate talent data within the player's character. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with GetTalentPoints() to retrieve the current talent point allocation
    for each spec.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the PlayerTalentMap structure for the specified spec.
    Returns nullptr if the spec is invalid or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerTalentMap* talentMap = player->GetTalentMap(0);\nif (talentMap)\n\
      {\n    // Use talentMap\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other talent-related methods
    to access and modify player talent data. It's important to note that the spec
    parameter refers to the index of the talent specialization, which is usually 0
    or 1 depending on the player's current spec.
  warnings: Be cautious when accessing this method as it may return nullptr if the
    spec is not valid or initialized. Always check for null before using the returned
    pointer to avoid crashes.
