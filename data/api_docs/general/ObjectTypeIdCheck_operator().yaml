  brief: Checks if an object's type ID matches a specified value
  description: The ObjectTypeIdCheck::operator() method performs a type check on a
    given object by comparing its type ID against a predefined target type. This is
    commonly used in TrinityCore's object management and filtering systems to determine
    whether an object belongs to a specific category, such as players, creatures,
    game objects, or items. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the object's type ID and returns true if it matches the expected type, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for efficient object handling in the World of
    Warcraft emulation environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object's type ID matches the expected type, false otherwise.
    The method evaluates whether the integer pointed to by the parameter represents
    a valid object type that conforms to the criteria defined in the class instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for checking player objects
    code: 'ObjectTypeIdCheck checkPlayer(TYPEID_PLAYER);

      bool isPlayer = checkPlayer(&objectId); // Returns true if objectId represents
      a player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within STL algorithms or lambda expressions
    for filtering collections of objects. The parameter 'object' should point to a
    valid integer representing an object's type ID. Performance is optimal when used
    with pre-constructed check objects rather than creating new ones repeatedly.
  warnings: Ensure that the input pointer is not null before dereferencing it. This
    method assumes that the integer pointed to contains a valid type ID value from
    TrinityCore's type system, which may cause undefined behavior if invalid values
    are passed.
