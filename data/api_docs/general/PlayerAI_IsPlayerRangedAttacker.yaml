  method: IsPlayerRangedAttacker
  signature: bool PlayerAI::IsPlayerRangedAttacker(const int * who)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently using a ranged attack type.
  description: The IsPlayerRangedAttacker method checks if the player's current attack
    mode or weapon type is classified as ranged. This function evaluates the player's
    equipped weapons and attack state to determine if they are performing or capable
    of performing ranged attacks, such as shooting bows, guns, or throwing weapons.
    The method is typically used in AI logic to adjust behavior based on the player's
    combat capabilities. It may consider factors like weapon type, spell casting state,
    and current attack stance.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target or context of the check.
      This parameter is optional and may be NULL. When provided, it specifies which
      player or entity's ranged attacker status should be evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently using a ranged attack type (such
    as bow, gun, or thrown weapon), false otherwise. The result depends on the player's
    current equipped weapons and combat state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is using ranged attack
    code: "if (playerAI->IsPlayerRangedAttacker(nullptr)) {\n    // Player is currently\
      \ using a ranged weapon\n    // Perform ranged-specific AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with target context to evaluate specific player
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Some target unit\nif (playerAI->IsPlayerRangedAttacker(reinterpret_cast<const\
      \ int*>(&target->GetGUID()))) {\n    // Target player is using a ranged weapon\n\
      \    // Adjust AI behavior accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the player's equipped
    items and attack mode. It may not reflect real-time changes immediately after
    weapon swaps unless the AI system is updated. The parameter 'who' might be used
    for multi-target scenarios or when checking specific players in group settings.
  warnings: The parameter 'who' should be carefully validated as it can be NULL, and
    improper handling of this pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method
    may not account for temporary spell effects that change attack types dynamically.
