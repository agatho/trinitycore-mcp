api:
  class: EscortAI
  method: GetMaxPlayerDistance
  signature: float EscortAI::GetMaxPlayerDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum distance between the escort AI unit and
    any player in its associated group or area.
  description: The GetMaxPlayerDistance method determines the largest distance from
    the EscortAI's current position to any player that is either part of the escort
    group or within the defined escort area. This value is typically used for determining
    when an escort has wandered too far from players, triggering events such as abandoning
    the escort or returning to a safe zone. The method performs distance calculations
    using the unit's current location and player positions, making it essential for
    maintaining proper escort behavior in World of Warcraft instances. It is commonly
    invoked during escort update cycles to monitor player proximity and ensure mission
    integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum distance (in yards) between the
    EscortAI unit and any player in its associated group or area. Returns 0.0f if
    no players are found within the defined range or if the escort AI has not been
    initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Check if escort is too far from players
    code: "if (escortAI->GetMaxPlayerDistance() > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Escort is too\
      \ far from players, initiate return to safe zone\n    escortAI->SetState(ESCORT_STATE_RETURN_TO_START);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor player proximity during escort
    code: "float maxDistance = escortAI->GetMaxPlayerDistance();\nif (maxDistance\
      \ > 30.0f)\n{\n    // Log warning about player separation\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Escort %u has players at distance %.2f yards\", \n                    escortAI->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ maxDistance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the EscortAI, including the current
    target group and player tracking. It may return inaccurate results if the escort
    AI has not been properly initialized or if players are outside the expected escort
    area. The calculation uses straight-line distance (Euclidean) rather than pathfinding
    distances.
  warnings: Do not call this method on an uninitialized EscortAI instance, as it may
    lead to undefined behavior. The returned value is only meaningful when the escort
    AI has active player tracking enabled and valid player data.
