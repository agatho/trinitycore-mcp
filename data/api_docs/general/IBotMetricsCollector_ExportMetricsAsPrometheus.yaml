  brief: Exports collected bot metrics in Prometheus exposition format as a string
  description: The ExportMetricsAsPrometheus method serializes all collected bot metrics
    into the Prometheus text-based exposition format. This format is compatible with
    Prometheus monitoring systems and allows for easy integration with metric collection
    and visualization tools. The method aggregates all available metrics from the
    collector instance and returns them as a single formatted string that can be consumed
    by Prometheus or other monitoring solutions. The exported metrics typically include
    counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries representing various bot performance
    and operational statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the complete Prometheus exposition format output
    with all collected metrics. This string follows the standard Prometheus metric
    format including metric names, labels, and values in a text-based representation
    suitable for ingestion by monitoring systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* collector = GetBotMetricsCollector();

      std::string prometheusOutput = collector->ExportMetricsAsPrometheus();

      // Output can now be served to a Prometheus endpoint or logged

      std::cout << prometheusOutput << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with HTTP Endpoint
    code: "void HandleMetricsRequest(HttpRequest* request, HttpResponse* response)\
      \ {\n    IBotMetricsCollector* collector = GetBotMetricsCollector();\n    std::string\
      \ metrics = collector->ExportMetricsAsPrometheus();\n    response->SetContentType(\"\
      text/plain; version=0.0.4\");\n    response->SetBody(metrics);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called by monitoring endpoints or HTTP handlers that
    expose metrics to external systems. It's important to note that the returned string
    may be quite large depending on the number of collected metrics and their complexity.
    The implementation should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads concurrently,
    though this depends on the specific implementation details of the IBotMetricsCollector
    interface.
  warnings: The exported metrics string includes all collected data which may contain
    sensitive information. Ensure proper access controls are in place when exposing
    this endpoint to external systems. In high-frequency scenarios, repeated calls
    to this method might impact performance due to serialization overhead.
