documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale data for a specified game object entry.
  description: The GetGameObjectLocale method fetches locale-specific information
    associated with a given game object entry ID. This method is typically used to
    access localized strings or data for game objects such as doors, chests, or other
    interactive elements in the World of Warcraft client. It returns a pointer to
    an array of integers that represent locale-specific data for the specified game
    object. The method assumes that the internal locale data structure has been properly
    initialized and populated with valid game object locale entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array containing locale-specific data for
    the requested game object entry. Returns nullptr if no locale data is found for
    the specified entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve locale data for a game object
    code: "const int* localeData = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectLocale(176545);\nif (localeData\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process locale-specific data\n    printf(\"Locale data\
      \ found for entry 176545\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No locale data found\
      \ for entry 176545\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are populated during server
    startup or when game object templates are loaded. The returned pointer should
    not be modified and is only valid while the ObjectMgr instance remains active.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no locale data exists for the specified
    entry. Always check for null before dereferencing the returned value to prevent
    segmentation faults.
