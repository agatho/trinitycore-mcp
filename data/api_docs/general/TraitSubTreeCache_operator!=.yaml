documentation:
  brief: Compares two TraitSubTreeCache objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this TraitSubTreeCache
    instance and another TraitSubTreeCache object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison is typically used in conditional statements or container operations
    where it's necessary to check whether two trait subtree caches differ in their
    contents or state. The implementation likely compares internal data structures
    such as cached trait configurations, node mappings, or related metadata that define
    the trait subtree. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    supports efficient caching and comparison of trait systems, which are integral
    to character progression and specialization mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the two TraitSubTreeCache objects are not equal; otherwise
    returns false. The equality check is based on the internal state and data stored
    within each cache instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: "TraitSubTreeCache cache1;\nTraitSubTreeCache cache2;\n\nif (cache1 != cache2)\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where caches differ\n    std::cout << \"Caches are not\
      \ equal\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Container Comparison
    code: "std::vector<TraitSubTreeCache> cacheList;\nTraitSubTreeCache currentCache;\n\
      \n// Add some caches to list...\nfor (const auto& existingCache : cacheList)\
      \ {\n    if (currentCache != existingCache) {\n        // Process different\
      \ cache\n        std::cout << \"Found a differing cache\" << std::endl;\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a deep comparison of internal
    data members. It's important to note that performance may vary depending on the
    complexity of the cached trait data being compared. The method should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections, especially when comparing large trait
    subtrees.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this operator for frequent comparisons in
    tight loops, as it might involve expensive operations if the underlying cache
    structures are complex. Ensure that both objects are properly initialized before
    comparison to avoid undefined behavior.
