documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a player is resurrected in the game world
  description: The OnResurrection method is invoked when a player character is successfully
    resurrected, either through natural means such as resurrection spells or by being
    revived at a graveyard. This method manages the cleanup and state transitions
    associated with the resurrection process, including updating player statistics,
    resetting temporary conditions, and ensuring proper synchronization of the player's
    game state. It typically runs within the context of the death recovery system
    and may interact with other subsystems like the player's health regeneration,
    aura management, or quest progression systems.

    code: "void MyDeathRecoveryManager::OnResurrection()\n{\n    // Reset player's\
      \ temporary debuffs\n    player->RemoveAllAuras();\n    \n    // Restore player\
      \ to full health\n    player->SetHealth(player->GetMaxHealth());\n    \n   \
      \ // Update resurrection-related quest objectives\n    if (player->HasQuest(QUEST_RESURRECTION_EVENT))\n\
      \        player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_RESURRECTION_EVENT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core TrinityCore death handling
    system and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom resurrection
    logic. It assumes that the player object is valid and in a state where resurrection
    is appropriate.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on players who are not in a valid resurrection
    state, as it may lead to inconsistent game state or crashes. Ensure all necessary
    preconditions are met before invoking this function.
