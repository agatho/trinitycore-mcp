documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest log description text for display in the player's quest
    log.
  description: The GetLogDescription method retrieves the localized quest description
    text that appears in the player's quest log. This text typically includes the
    quest's objective, reward information, and other relevant details that help players
    understand what needs to be done to complete the quest. The method is commonly
    used by the game engine to display quest information in the UI, particularly when
    a player opens their quest log or when quest-related events occur. It returns
    a string containing the description text which may vary based on the quest's specific
    requirements and player's progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const std::string& representing the quest log description text
    that is displayed in the player's quest log, containing information about quest
    objectives, rewards, and other relevant details.
  examples:

      // Use description in UI display or logging

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest log updates or when displaying
    quest information in the UI. It may return different values depending on the player's
    progress and quest status, and should be used carefully to ensure proper display
    of quest details.
  warnings: The returned string may be empty or null if the quest has not been properly
    initialized or if the quest template does not contain valid description data.
    Care should be taken when using this method in contexts where quest information
    might be missing or invalid.
