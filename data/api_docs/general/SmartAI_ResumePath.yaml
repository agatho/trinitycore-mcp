documentation:
  brief: Resumes execution of a path that was previously paused in SmartAI.
  description: The ResumePath method is used to continue the execution of a path that
    was previously interrupted or paused within the SmartAI system. This method typically
    works in conjunction with path-related AI behaviors such as waypoint movement,
    where an NPC might need to pause its path for certain conditions (e.g., combat,
    player interaction) and then resume from where it left off. It ensures that the
    AI agent continues along the intended route without losing its current position
    or state in the path sequence.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ResumePath
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Pause the current path\n\
      \    me->GetAI()->PausePath();\n    \n    // Perform combat actions...\n   \
      \ \n    // Resume the path after combat\n    me->GetAI()->ResumePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a path has been previously started and paused using
    a corresponding PausePath() call. It does not validate whether a path is actually
    paused or in progress, so calling ResumePath without prior pausing may have undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling ResumePath without first calling PausePath can lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the AI state is consistent and that path-related
    data structures are properly initialized before invoking this method.
