  class: LootCoordination
  method: MinimizeLootTime
  signature: void LootCoordination::MinimizeLootTime(Group * group, uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Minimizes the loot time for a group's loot coordination session.
  description: The MinimizeLootTime method reduces the remaining time for a loot coordination
    process within a group. This is typically used to expedite loot distribution when
    players are ready to proceed with loot assignment, rather than waiting for the
    full loot timer to expire. The method operates on a specified group and session
    ID to identify which loot coordination instance should have its timer reduced.
    It ensures that loot is distributed more quickly without affecting the integrity
    of the loot system or player fairness.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot coordination
      time should be minimized.
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific loot coordination session. Used
      to distinguish between multiple concurrent loot events within the same group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Minimize loot time for a group's current loot session
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      LootCoordination::MinimizeLootTime(myGroup, sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot coordination events when players
    have decided to proceed with loot assignment immediately. It modifies internal
    timers and should be used carefully to avoid disrupting ongoing loot processes
    or causing race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided group pointer and session ID are valid before
    calling this method. Passing an invalid group or session ID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the loot coordination system.
