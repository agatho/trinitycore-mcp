documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player bot migration schema in the database
  description: The ApplyInitialSchema method sets up the initial database schema required
    for player bot migration functionality. This method is typically called during
    server startup or migration initialization to ensure all necessary tables, columns,
    and constraints are properly created in the database. It handles the creation
    of migration tracking tables, version control structures, and any other schema
    elements needed for the player bot migration system to function correctly. The
    method performs checks to avoid duplicate schema application and ensures data
    integrity during the initialization process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the schema was successfully applied or already exists,
    false if the schema application failed due to database errors or permission issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ApplyInitialSchema()) {\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      playerbots\", \"Player bot migration schema applied successfully\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to apply player bot migration schema\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server initialization or when explicitly
    managing the migration process. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning it can
    be safely called multiple times without causing issues. The method may perform
    database transactions that could impact performance on large databases.
  warnings: Calling this method after initial schema setup may cause data inconsistencies
    if player bot data already exists in the database. Ensure proper backup procedures
    are followed before executing this method in production environments.
