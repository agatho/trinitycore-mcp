  class: BotLifecycleManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void BotLifecycleManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for bot lifecycle management in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the BotLifecycleManager
    performs its periodic updates and operations. This interval determines the cadence
    at which bots are processed, checked for validity, and managed within the game
    world. The value is specified in milliseconds and affects all active bot instances
    under this manager's control. A smaller interval results in more frequent updates
    but may increase CPU usage, while a larger interval reduces resource consumption
    but may delay bot behavior responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are positive integers
      representing time intervals. Typical values range from 100ms to several seconds
      depending on desired responsiveness and performance requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a moderate update interval
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::Instance();

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(500); // Update every 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring high-frequency updates for responsive bots
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::Instance();

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(100); // Update every 100ms for more responsive behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the performance characteristics of bot operations.
    Setting very small intervals may cause performance degradation on servers with
    many active bots. The interval is applied immediately to all existing bots and
    will affect future bot creation.
  warnings: Changing this value while bots are actively running may cause inconsistent
    behavior or missed updates. It's recommended to set the interval before starting
    bot operations or during server maintenance windows.
