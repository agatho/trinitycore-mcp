  class: IBotMetricsCollector
  method: CollectSystemMetrics
  signature: void IBotMetricsCollector::CollectSystemMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Collects and records system resource usage metrics for bot performance monitoring.
  description: The CollectSystemMetrics method gathers current system resource utilization
    data including CPU load, memory consumption, and disk I/O statistics. This method
    is typically invoked periodically by the bot management system to monitor performance
    and detect potential bottlenecks. The collected metrics are used for optimizing
    bot behavior, identifying resource contention, and ensuring stable operation within
    the World of Warcraft environment. The method does not require any specific preconditions
    but should be called with appropriate frequency to maintain accurate monitoring.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Manager
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateBotMetrics()\n{\n    m_metricsCollector->CollectSystemMetrics();\n\
      }\n\n// Called every 30 seconds to monitor system resources"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may block briefly during metric collection, especially when querying
    detailed system information. It's recommended to call this method from a background
    thread or during idle periods to avoid impacting gameplay performance. The collected
    metrics are typically stored internally and can be accessed via getter methods
    on the same interface.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method too frequently (e.g., more than once per second)
    as it may introduce unnecessary overhead. The method relies on system APIs that
    might not be available in all environments, particularly when running in restricted
    or virtualized server configurations.
