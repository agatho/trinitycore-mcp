documentation:
  brief: Initializes and activates the loot strategy for a bot AI instance
  description: The OnActivate method is called when a LootStrategy is activated for
    a specific bot AI instance. This method typically performs initialization tasks
    required for the loot strategy to function properly, such as setting up internal
    state, registering event handlers, or preparing data structures needed for loot
    decision-making. The method ensures that the strategy is ready to process loot-related
    events and decisions within the context of the provided AI instance. It is usually
    invoked during the bot's initialization phase or when the strategy is dynamically
    enabled.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this loot strategy will be associated
      with. Must not be null and should represent a valid bot AI context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic activation of a loot strategy
    code: 'LootStrategy* strategy = new CustomLootStrategy();

      BotAI* ai = bot->GetBotAI();

      strategy->OnActivate(ai);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per strategy instance, typically during
    initialization. The ai parameter must remain valid for the duration of the strategy's
    use.
