    type)
documentation:
  brief: Registers the player for participation in a specified world event type.
  description: The ParticipateInWorldEvent method allows a player to register for
    participation in a specific type of world event. This method is typically used
    within the context of advanced AI behaviors to manage player engagement with dynamic
    game events such as holidays, seasonal celebrations, or special in-game activities.
    The method returns true if the registration was successful and false if the player
    is already registered or if the event type is invalid. It ensures that the player's
    behavior manager is updated to reflect their participation status for the given
    world event.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully registered for the world event,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the player is already
    participating in an event of the same type or that the provided event type is
    not valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Participation
    code: "if (player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->ParticipateInWorldEvent(WORLD_EVENT_HOLIDAY_FIREWORKS))\
      \ {\n    // Player successfully registered for fireworks event\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player registered for fireworks event.\");\n} else {\n    // Registration failed\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to register player for fireworks event.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI behavior initialization or when
    a player interacts with an event-related object. The method may internally check
    if the player has already participated in a similar event and prevent duplicate
    registrations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the WorldEventType parameter
    may result in undefined behavior or failed registration attempts. Ensure that
    the event type is valid before calling this method.
