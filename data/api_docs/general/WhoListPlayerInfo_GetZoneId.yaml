  class: WhoListPlayerInfo
  method: GetZoneId
  signature: uint32 WhoListPlayerInfo::GetZoneId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone identifier where the player is currently located.
  description: The GetZoneId method returns the unique zone identifier (ZoneID) for
    the player represented by this WhoListPlayerInfo object. This identifier corresponds
    to the specific geographic area or zone in the game world where the player is
    currently present. The ZoneID is used internally by the TrinityCore server to
    manage player positioning, zone-based events, and zone-specific gameplay mechanics.
    This method does not perform any validation or lookup operations; it simply returns
    the cached zone ID value that was set when the WhoListPlayerInfo object was created
    or updated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the zone identifier (ZoneID) of the player's
    current location in the game world. This ID maps to a specific zone definition
    in the game database and is used for zone-based operations such as zone-based
    quest tracking, zone-specific loot tables, and area-triggered events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo with data ...\n\
      uint32 currentZoneId = playerInfo.GetZoneId();\nif (currentZoneId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is in zone ID: %u\\n\", currentZoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Zone-based Logic
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo with data ...\n\
      uint32 zoneId = playerInfo.GetZoneId();\nswitch (zoneId)\n{\n    case 141: //\
      \ Durotar\n        printf(\"Player is in Durotar\\n\");\n        break;\n  \
      \  case 1519: // Stormwind City\n        printf(\"Player is in Stormwind City\\\
      n\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        printf(\"Player is in zone ID:\
      \ %u\\n\", zoneId);\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ZoneID value is typically populated from the player's current
    position data when the WhoListPlayerInfo object is constructed. In some cases,
    if a player is in an instance or dungeon, this may return the instance zone ID
    rather than the parent zone ID. The method is thread-safe as it only reads cached
    data and does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: Be aware that a ZoneID of 0 may indicate an invalid or unknown location,
    though this should be rare in normal operation. Always validate the returned value
    if your code depends on valid zone information. The zone ID does not account for
    sub-zones or specific locations within a zone - it only represents the primary
    zone identifier.
