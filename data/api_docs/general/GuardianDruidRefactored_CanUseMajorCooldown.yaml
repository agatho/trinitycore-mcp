documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Guardian Druid can currently use a major cooldown
    ability.
  description: This method evaluates the current state of the Guardian Druid to determine
    if it is eligible to use a major cooldown ability. It checks various conditions
    such as mana availability, cooldown timers, and player status to ensure that the
    ability can be safely used without violating game mechanics or restrictions. This
    function is typically called before attempting to activate a major cooldown to
    prevent invalid usage during inappropriate times.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Guardian Druid is eligible to use a major cooldown;
    otherwise, returns false.

      \ // Do not use the cooldown, perhaps wait or perform alternative action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may consider factors such as current mana level, global cooldown
    state, and player buffs/debuffs. It's important to note that this check does not
    account for spell-specific restrictions beyond general eligibility.
