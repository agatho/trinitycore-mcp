  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: Update
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawner's internal state and manages spawning logic based
    on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for driving the core functionality
    of the BotSpawnerOptimized class. It processes the passage of time through the
    'diff' parameter, which represents milliseconds since the last update call. This
    method evaluates conditions such as cooldowns, player presence, and server load
    to determine whether new bots should be spawned or existing ones should be managed.
    The method is typically called from the game loop at regular intervals, ensuring
    that bot spawning occurs in a controlled and efficient manner without overwhelming
    the server. It may also handle cleanup of inactive bots or perform periodic maintenance
    tasks related to bot management.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last call to this method.
      Used to determine timing for spawning decisions and cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n    botSpawner.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Spawning Logic
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    static uint32 lastSpawnTime = 0;\n   \
      \ if (GetMSTime() - lastSpawnTime > SPAWN_INTERVAL_MS)\n    {\n        botSpawner.Update(diff);\n\
      \        lastSpawnTime = GetMSTime();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently from the main game loop.
    It's important that 'diff' accurately reflects the time passed, as incorrect timing
    can lead to either excessive or insufficient bot spawning. The implementation
    likely uses internal timers and state tracking to avoid redundant operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper timing control may result in erratic
    behavior such as rapid bot spawning or failure to spawn bots when expected. Ensure
    that 'diff' is updated correctly with each tick of the game loop.
