  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: GetGameObject
  signature: GameObject * BotActionProcessor::GetGameObject(Player * bot, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a GameObject instance from the world based on the provided GUID
    for use in bot AI logic.
  description: The GetGameObject method is used within the BotActionProcessor class
    to fetch a GameObject object from the game world using its unique identifier (GUID).
    This method is essential for bots to interact with in-game objects such as chests,
    doors, or quest items. The method takes a Player pointer representing the bot
    and an integer GUID to locate and return the corresponding GameObject. It serves
    as a bridge between the bot's AI logic and the actual game world state, enabling
    bots to perform actions like opening containers or examining interactive objects.
    The returned GameObject pointer can be null if the object does not exist in the
    current world context or has been destroyed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is requesting
      the GameObject. This parameter is used to determine the context and location
      of the bot within the game world.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject
      to retrieve. This GUID must correspond to an existing GameObject in the current
      world instance.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject if found and valid; otherwise, returns
    nullptr if no GameObject exists with the specified GUID or if it's invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetGameObject to retrieve a chest
    code: "GameObject* chest = botActionProcessor->GetGameObject(bot, 12345);\nif\
      \ (chest && chest->GetGOInfo()->type == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CHEST)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ action on the chest\n    bot->HandleGameObject(chest->GetGUID(), true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe retrieval and usage of GameObject with null check
    code: "uint32 chestGuid = 67890;\nGameObject* gameObject = botActionProcessor->GetGameObject(bot,\
      \ chestGuid);\nif (gameObject != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the game object\n \
      \   TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"bot.ai\", \"Found GameObject with entry %u at position (%f,\
      \ %f, %f)\",\n        gameObject->GetEntry(),\n        gameObject->GetPositionX(),\n\
      \        gameObject->GetPositionY(),\n        gameObject->GetPositionZ());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"bot.ai\", \"GameObject with GUID %u not found.\"\
      , chestGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the world's GameObject registry using the
    provided GUID. It is recommended to validate the returned pointer before use,
    as objects may be destroyed or removed from the world between the time of lookup
    and usage. The method relies on the bot's current world context to resolve the
    GUID correctly.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where GameObjects might
    be destroyed or despawned during execution. Always check for null return values
    before dereferencing the returned pointer. Using stale GUIDs can lead to invalid
    object references and potential crashes.
