  class: RestMgr
  method: GetInnTrigger
  signature: int RestMgr::GetInnTrigger() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the trigger identifier associated with the rest manager's inn location.
  description: The GetInnTrigger method returns an integer identifier that corresponds
    to a specific inn trigger object within the World of Warcraft instance. This trigger
    is typically used to determine when a player enters or interacts with an inn for
    resting purposes. The returned value represents the unique identifier of the inn's
    trigger game object, which can be used to locate and interact with the inn in
    various gameplay scenarios such as resting, saving position, or triggering inn-specific
    events. This method is commonly called during player rest mechanics and zone transition
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the inn trigger
    game object associated with this RestMgr instance. Returns 0 if no valid inn trigger
    is assigned or available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Inn Trigger
    code: "int triggerId = restMgr.GetInnTrigger();\nif (triggerId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player is at a valid inn location\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is at inn\
      \ with trigger ID: %d\", triggerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Inn Trigger for Rest Mechanics
    code: "uint32 playerInnTrigger = player->GetRestMgr()->GetInnTrigger();\nif (playerInnTrigger\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Find the corresponding game object\n    GameObject* innTrigger\
      \ = player->FindNearestGameObject(playerInnTrigger, 5.0f);\n    if (innTrigger\
      \ && innTrigger->GetGOInfo()->type == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_INN_KEEPER)\n    {\n \
      \       // Proceed with rest mechanics\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(1,\
      \ innTrigger->GetGUID());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GameObject lookups to determine
    the specific inn location a player is resting at. The returned value should be
    treated as a GUID reference to a game object of type GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_INN_KEEPER.
    This method may return 0 if the rest manager has not been properly initialized
    or if the current location does not correspond to an inn.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees the existence of
    the corresponding GameObject in memory. Always validate the returned GUID against
    actual game object instances before performing operations on them. This method
    may return stale data if the player's location changes without updating the rest
    manager state.
