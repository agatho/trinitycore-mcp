  method: GetTemporaryUnsummonedPetNumber
  signature: uint32 Player::GetTemporaryUnsummonedPetNumber() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the player's temporary unsummoned pet.
  description: This method retrieves the GUID of the pet that was temporarily unsummoned
    by the player, typically when using the 'Dismiss Pet' command or similar mechanics.
    The returned value represents the unique identifier of the last summoned pet that
    was unsummoned, which can be used to re-summon the pet later. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with pet management systems and is essential for maintaining
    proper pet state tracking during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the GUID of the temporary unsummoned pet.
    If no pet has been unsummoned, this value will be 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 petGUID = player->GetTemporaryUnsummonedPetNumber();\nif (petGUID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Pet was previously unsummoned, can re-summon it\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pet management functions
    and should be called after a pet has been unsummoned. The value returned represents
    the GUID of the last summoned pet that was unsummoned, which may differ from the
    GUID of a currently active pet.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it can lead to incorrect
    pet state tracking if used improperly. This method does not guarantee that the
    pet will be re-summoned successfully, and should only be used in conjunction with
    proper pet management logic.
