  class: InventoryManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void InventoryManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the inventory manager in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the inventory
    manager should perform updates or checks on player inventories. This interval
    determines the cadence at which inventory-related operations such as synchronization
    with the client, validation of item counts, or triggering of inventory events
    occur. The update interval is typically used to balance performance and responsiveness
    in World of Warcraft's client-server communication model. Setting this value too
    low may cause excessive network traffic and CPU usage, while setting it too high
    might delay inventory state synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. This value controls how often
      the inventory manager performs internal updates. Valid values are typically
      positive integers, with common ranges between 100ms and 5000ms depending on
      desired responsiveness vs. performance trade-offs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set standard update interval
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventoryMgr = player->GetInventoryManager();

      inventoryMgr->SetUpdateInterval(1000); // Update every second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set fast update interval for critical items
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventoryMgr = player->GetInventoryManager();

      inventoryMgr->SetUpdateInterval(250); // Update every 250ms for high-frequency
      items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal timers or scheduled events within the
    InventoryManager class. The actual update behavior may depend on other system
    components such as network synchronization and client polling mechanisms. Changes
    to this interval may not take effect immediately if there are pending operations.
  warnings: Setting very low intervals (e.g., below 50ms) can cause performance degradation
    due to excessive processing overhead. This method should be used carefully in
    high-concurrency scenarios where multiple players might be affected by frequent
    updates.
