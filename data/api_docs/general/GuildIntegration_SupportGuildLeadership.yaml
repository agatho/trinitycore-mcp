  signature: void GuildIntegration::SupportGuildLeadership(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Supports guild leadership by initializing or updating player leadership data
    within the guild integration system.
  description: The SupportGuildLeadership method is responsible for managing and maintaining
    the leadership status of a player within the guild integration framework. This
    method likely handles the initialization, validation, or updating of leadership-related
    data structures for a given player. It may be invoked during guild creation, player
    promotion/demotion, or when leadership permissions need to be synchronized across
    the system. The method operates on a pointer to an integer representing the player's
    identifier and ensures that the guild leadership hierarchy is properly maintained
    within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the player whose leadership status is being supported. The value pointed to
      should be a valid player GUID or null to indicate no player.
  returns: No return value. This method performs operations internally and does not
    provide a result.
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Leadership Support for a Player
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.SupportGuildLeadership(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Support Leadership with Null Player Pointer
    code: 'int* nullPlayer = nullptr;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.SupportGuildLeadership(nullPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild leadership tracking systems
    and may perform checks for player permissions or guild membership status. It is
    recommended to ensure that the player GUID passed is valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer to the player parameter may
    lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior. Always validate that the player
    GUID exists and is accessible before invoking this method.
