documentation:
  brief: Updates the defensive abilities and cooldowns for the restoration shaman.
  description: The UpdateDefensives method is responsible for managing and updating
    the defensive capabilities of a restoration shaman class character. This includes
    handling cooldowns, mana costs, and activation states of defensive spells such
    as Earth Shield, Healing Stream Totem, and other defensive abilities that are
    part of the shaman's toolkit. The method ensures that these defensive abilities
    are properly synchronized with the game state, including checking for valid targets,
    available resources, and appropriate timing for spell usage. It is typically invoked
    during the AI update cycle to maintain optimal defensive positioning and resource
    management.

  - title: Basic UpdateDefensives Usage
    code: "void UpdateDefensives()\n{\n    // Implementation would check current defensive\
      \ abilities\n    // and update their cooldowns or activation states\n    if\
      \ (HasAura(SPELL_EARTH_SHIELD))\n        UpdateCooldown(SPELL_EARTH_SHIELD);\n\
      \    else\n        CastSpell(SPELL_EARTH_SHIELD);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update loop and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The method relies on
    internal state tracking of spell cooldowns and resource availability.
  warnings: Improper handling of defensive ability updates can lead to incorrect cooldown
    states or missed defensive opportunities in combat situations.
