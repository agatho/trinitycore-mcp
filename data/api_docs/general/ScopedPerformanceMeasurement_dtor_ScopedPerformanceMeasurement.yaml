  class: ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
  method: ~ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
  signature: void ScopedPerformanceMeasurement::~ScopedPerformanceMeasurement()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the scoped performance measurement object and records the elapsed
    time.
  description: The destructor for ScopedPerformanceMeasurement is automatically invoked
    when the object goes out of scope. It finalizes the performance measurement by
    calculating the elapsed time since the object was created and logs this information,
    typically used for profiling code sections. This class is commonly employed in
    TrinityCore to monitor execution times of various subsystems or game logic components
    without requiring explicit start/stop calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Function Scope
    code: "void SomeGameFunction()\n{\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perf(\"SomeGameFunction\"\
      );\n    // ... game logic here ...\n    // perf destructor automatically logs\
      \ timing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Nested Performance Measurements
    code: "void ComplexUpdate()\n{\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement outer(\"ComplexUpdate\"\
      );\n    {\n        ScopedPerformanceMeasurement inner(\"InnerLogic\");\n   \
      \     // ... inner logic ...\n    }\n    // Inner measurement logs first, then\
      \ outer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically implemented using high-resolution timers and relies
    on the system's performance counter APIs. The timing data is usually logged to
    the TrinityCore log files or sent to a performance monitoring system for analysis.
