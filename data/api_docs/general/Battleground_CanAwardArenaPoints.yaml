  class: Battleground
  method: CanAwardArenaPoints
  signature: bool Battleground::CanAwardArenaPoints() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether arena points can be awarded for this battleground.
  description: The CanAwardArenaPoints method checks if the current battleground instance
    is eligible to award arena points to players. This method typically evaluates
    whether the battleground has completed its required conditions for point distribution,
    such as having a valid match outcome and sufficient player participation. It ensures
    that arena points are only awarded when appropriate, preventing invalid or premature
    point distributions during matchmaking, pre-game phases, or incomplete matches.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if arena points can be awarded for this battleground; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the match state and conditions support point
    distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Arena Points Can Be Awarded
    code: "if (bg->CanAwardArenaPoints()) {\n    // Proceed with awarding arena points\n\
      \    bg->AwardArenaPoints();\n} else {\n    // Do not award points\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_BATTLEGROUND,\
      \ \"Arena points cannot be awarded for this battleground.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the battleground's cleanup phase or
    after match completion to determine eligibility for arena point distribution.
    It may consider factors such as match duration, player count, and outcome validity.
