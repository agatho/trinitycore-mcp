  class: Battleground
  method: PlaySoundToAll
  signature: void Battleground::PlaySoundToAll(int SoundID)
documentation:
  brief: Plays a sound effect to all players in the battleground.
  description: The PlaySoundToAll method broadcasts a sound effect to every player
    currently participating in the battleground. This method is typically used to
    signal events such as flag captures, victory/defeat announcements, or other significant
    gameplay moments. The sound ID parameter corresponds to an entry in the game's
    sound database, and the sound is played simultaneously for all players within
    the battleground instance. This method does not return any value and operates
    on the current battleground context.
  parameters:
  - name: SoundID
    description: The identifier of the sound effect to play. This must correspond
      to a valid sound entry in the game's database, typically defined in the SoundEntries
      table or similar system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Play Victory Sound
    code: "void Battleground::OnPlayerFlagCapture(Player* player)\n{\n    PlaySoundToAll(12345);\
      \ // Plays victory sound to all players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Announce Flag Capture
    code: "void Battleground::HandleFlagCapture(Player* player)\n{\n    PlaySoundToAll(12346);\
      \ // Plays flag capture sound\n    // Additional logic for handling the capture\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within battleground event handlers
    or game logic that requires immediate auditory feedback for all players. It should
    not be used outside of battleground contexts as it may not function correctly
    in other environments.
