  class: PositionUtils
  method: IsInMeleeRange
  signature: bool PositionUtils::IsInMeleeRange(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within melee attack range of a target unit.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if a given player character can
    perform a melee attack on a specified target unit based on their current positions
    and combat mechanics. It considers the standard melee range defined by the game's
    combat system, typically including the player's weapon's reach and any applicable
    modifiers such as stance or movement speed. This method is commonly used in AI
    decision-making processes to determine if an attack should be attempted or if
    the player needs to move closer to the target. The function returns true if the
    target is within melee range, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the melee check. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target of the melee check.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is within melee range of the target, false otherwise.
    The range calculation includes standard combat mechanics such as weapon reach
    and any applicable movement or stance modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (PositionUtils::IsInMeleeRange(playerBot, targetUnit)) {\n    playerBot->Attack(targetUnit,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    playerBot->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat decision tree
    code: "bool canMelee = PositionUtils::IsInMeleeRange(playerBot, target);\nif (canMelee)\
      \ {\n    // Execute melee attack\n    playerBot->CastSpell(target, MELEE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n} else if (playerBot->GetDistance(target) < PLAYER_RANGED_RANGE) {\n\
      \    // Switch to ranged attack\n    playerBot->CastSpell(target, RANGED_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Move closer\n    playerBot->MoveTowards(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal distance calculations and combat
    mechanics. It accounts for unit sizes, weapon reach, and movement states. For
    performance reasons, it should not be called excessively in tight loops without
    caching results.
  warnings: Ensure both player and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to avoid crashes. The method does not account for environmental obstacles or line-of-sight;
    it only checks positional distance.
