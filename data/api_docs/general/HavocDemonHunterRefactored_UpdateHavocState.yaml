  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::UpdateHavocState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the havoc state of the demon hunter based on current game conditions
    and abilities.
  description: The UpdateHavocState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal state of a Havoc Demon Hunter class instance. This includes tracking
    the player's current fury levels, ability cooldowns, combo points, and other relevant
    combat mechanics that define the havoc specialization's behavior. The method evaluates
    the current game context such as target status, available resources, and player
    actions to determine appropriate state transitions and updates. It ensures that
    the demon hunter's havoc abilities are properly synchronized with the game engine's
    internal systems, maintaining accurate tracking of buffs, debuffs, and resource
    consumption during combat scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: 'HavocDemonHunterRefactored* hunter = new HavocDemonHunterRefactored();

      hunter->UpdateHavocState();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_havocHunter->UpdateHavocState();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the combat update cycle or
    whenever significant state changes occur. It may internally trigger various internal
    state validations and ability readiness checks. The method is designed to be non-blocking
    and should not cause performance issues when called regularly.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of appropriate game update contexts as
    it may lead to inconsistent state tracking. Ensure that all related combat systems
    are properly initialized before calling this method for the first time.
