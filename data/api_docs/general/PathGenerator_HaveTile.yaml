  class: PathGenerator
  method: HaveTile
  signature: bool PathGenerator::HaveTile(const int & p) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific tile is available for pathfinding within the PathGenerator.
  description: The HaveTile method determines whether a particular tile, identified
    by its index 'p', has been loaded or is accessible for pathfinding operations.
    This method is typically used internally by the pathfinding system to verify tile
    availability before attempting to calculate paths across the game world. It helps
    ensure that navigation calculations are only performed on valid, loaded terrain
    data. The method does not perform any side effects and simply returns a boolean
    value indicating tile readiness.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: The index of the tile to check for availability. This is typically
      an integer representing a unique identifier for a specific grid tile in the
      game world's navigation mesh.
  returns: Returns true if the specified tile 'p' is available and loaded for pathfinding;
    otherwise, returns false if the tile is not accessible or has not been loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tile Availability Check
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\nint tileIndex = 12345;\nbool isTileAvailable =\
      \ pathGen.HaveTile(tileIndex);\nif (isTileAvailable)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ pathfinding using this tile\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal pathfinding infrastructure and should
    generally be called by the navigation system rather than directly by external
    code. It's optimized for fast lookup and does not involve expensive I/O operations.
