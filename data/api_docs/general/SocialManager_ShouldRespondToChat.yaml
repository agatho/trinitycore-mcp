  class: SocialManager
  method: ShouldRespondToChat
  signature: bool SocialManager::ShouldRespondToChat(Player * sender, const std::string
    & message, ChatType type)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player should respond to a chat message based on social
    settings and message type.
  description: The ShouldRespondToChat method evaluates if a player's social behavior
    allows them to respond to a given chat message. It considers the sender, message
    content, and chat type to determine if the player's social settings (such as ignoring,
    blocking, or friendship status) permit a response. This method is typically used
    in the context of in-game communication systems where players can control their
    social interactions with others. The method may be invoked when processing incoming
    chat messages to decide whether to trigger a response or notification.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the chat message. This parameter
      is used to determine the relationship between the sender and the current player,
      including friendship status, ignore lists, and other social settings.
  - name: message
    description: The text content of the chat message as a std::string. The method
      may analyze this content for specific keywords or patterns that could influence
      the response behavior.
  - name: type
    description: The ChatType enum value indicating the type of chat message (e.g.,
      SAY, YELL, WHISPER). Different chat types may have different social response
      rules applied.
  returns: Returns true if the player should respond to the chat message according
    to their social settings and the message context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a chat handler
    code: "if (socialManager.ShouldRespondToChat(senderPlayer, \"Hello there!\", CHAT_MSG_SAY))\
      \ {\n    // Send a response back to the sender\n    player->Say(\"Hi!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with whisper messages
    code: "if (socialManager.ShouldRespondToChat(sender, message, CHAT_MSG_WHISPER))\
      \ {\n    // Handle whisper response logic\n    player->Whisper(\"I received\
      \ your whisper.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL, sender);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the player's social list (friends, ignores,
    etc.) and may consider global server settings or guild membership when determining
    response behavior. It is important to note that this method does not actually
    send responses; it only determines whether a response should be sent.
