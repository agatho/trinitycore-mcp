  class: RoleAssignment
  method: RecommendRole
  signature: GroupRole RoleAssignment::RecommendRole(Player * player, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable group role for a given player within
    a group context.
  description: The RecommendRole method evaluates a player's current state, class,
    specialization, and group composition to determine the optimal role they should
    assume within a group. This function is typically used during group formation
    or role reassignment scenarios to ensure balanced team dynamics. It considers
    factors such as player level, equipped gear, talent specialization, and existing
    group roles to make an informed recommendation. The method does not modify any
    state directly but provides a suggestion that can be accepted or rejected by the
    group leader or system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupRole enumeration value indicating the recommended role for the player.
    Possible values include LEADER, TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, and NONE if no suitable
    role is determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Recommendation
    code: "GroupRole role = roleAssignment->RecommendRole(player, group);\nif (role\
      \ == GroupRole::TANK)\n{\n    // Assign tank role to player\n    // Logic for\
      \ assigning tank role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Recommendation with Validation
    code: "GroupRole recommendedRole = roleAssignment->RecommendRole(player, group);\n\
      if (recommendedRole != GroupRole::NONE)\n{\n    // Proceed with role assignment\
      \ logic\n    // Validate that the player can take on this role\n    // Update\
      \ group roster accordingly\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no role is\
      \ recommended\n    // Possibly log or notify user\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on internal player and group state evaluation.
    It may perform multiple checks including class-based role suitability, gear comparison,
    and current group composition analysis. The implementation assumes that both the
    player and group parameters are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the player and group objects passed to this method are fully
    initialized before calling. Calling this method with null or uninitialized pointers
    may result in undefined behavior. The returned role should not be applied directly
    without validation against existing group constraints.
