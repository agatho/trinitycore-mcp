  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: RegisterCommand
  signature: bool BotChatCommandHandler::RegisterCommand(const ChatCommand & command)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new chat command with the bot's command handler.
  description: The RegisterCommand method adds a new chat command to the BotChatCommandHandler's
    internal command registry. This allows the bot to recognize and respond to specific
    commands issued by players in the game. The method takes a ChatCommand object
    that defines the command's behavior, including its name, access level, and execution
    function. It returns true if the command was successfully registered, or false
    if registration failed due to conflicts or invalid parameters. This functionality
    is essential for extending bot capabilities through custom commands within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: A const reference to a ChatCommand object that defines the command
      to be registered. The ChatCommand structure must contain valid command name,
      access requirements, and execution handler function.
  returns: True if the command was successfully registered with the handler; false
    if registration failed due to duplicate names, invalid parameters, or other internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Registration
    code: "ChatCommand myCommand = {\n    \"mycommand\",\n    SEC_PLAYER,\n    &BotChatCommandHandler::HandleMyCommand\n\
      };\nbool success = botHandler.RegisterCommand(myCommand);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Command successfully registered\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Commands
    code: "std::vector<ChatCommand> commands = {\n    {\"help\", SEC_PLAYER, &BotChatCommandHandler::HandleHelp},\n\
      \    {\"status\", SEC_MODERATOR, &BotChatCommandHandler::HandleStatus}\n};\n\
      for (const auto& cmd : commands) {\n    botHandler.RegisterCommand(cmd);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during bot initialization or runtime command
    extension. The ChatCommand structure must be properly initialized with valid function
    pointers and access levels. Commands are stored in a hash map for fast lookup,
    so duplicate command names will result in failed registration.
  warnings: Registering commands with invalid function pointers can cause crashes.
    Ensure that all command handlers are properly implemented and accessible. Avoid
    registering commands with identical names as this will overwrite previous registrations
    silently.
