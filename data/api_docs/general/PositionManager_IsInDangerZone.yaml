  class: PositionManager
  method: IsInDangerZone
  signature: bool PositionManager::IsInDangerZone(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is within a dangerous zone.
  description: The IsInDangerZone method evaluates whether a specified position, represented
    by an integer identifier, falls within any defined dangerous area or zone in the
    game world. This functionality is typically used for threat detection, player
    safety checks, or AI decision-making processes where certain locations may pose
    risks to characters. The method likely utilizes internal zone data structures
    and collision detection logic to determine if the provided position intersects
    with any danger zones. It returns a boolean value indicating the result of this
    evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This could be a unique coordinate index, a zone ID, or another form of positional
      reference used internally by TrinityCore's positioning system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is located within any defined dangerous
    zone; otherwise returns false. The method does not throw exceptions but may return
    undefined behavior if the input pos is invalid or out of bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PositionManager posMgr;\nint playerPos = 12345;\nbool isInDanger = posMgr.IsInDangerZone(playerPos);\n\
      if (isInDanger) {\n    // Handle dangerous zone encounter\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    bool ShouldFlee(const int& currentPos) {\n\
      \        PositionManager posMgr;\n        return posMgr.IsInDangerZone(currentPos);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on precomputed zone boundaries and may cache results
    for performance. Developers should ensure that the input position identifier is
    valid and corresponds to an actual location in the game world. The implementation
    might be optimized for frequent calls, making it suitable for real-time AI or
    player state checks.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided pos parameter is a valid reference
    to a known position within the TrinityCore system. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure proper validation
    of input parameters before calling this method in performance-critical sections.
