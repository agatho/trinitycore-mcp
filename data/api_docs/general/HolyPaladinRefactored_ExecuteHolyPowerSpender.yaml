  signature: bool HolyPaladinRefactored::ExecuteHolyPowerSpender(int * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a holy power spender ability for the paladin, consuming holy power
    and performing the associated spell action.
  description: The ExecuteHolyPowerSpender method is responsible for activating a
    holy power-based spell or ability within the context of a Holy Paladin's AI behavior.
    This method typically consumes available holy power to execute a specific divine
    spell or ability that requires holy power as its resource. The method evaluates
    whether sufficient holy power is available and then proceeds to cast the corresponding
    spell, updating internal state variables accordingly. It serves as a core component
    in managing the paladin's holy power usage during combat scenarios, ensuring proper
    resource allocation and spell execution timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the holy power spender was successfully executed with sufficient
    holy power; returns false if there was insufficient holy power or if the execution
    failed for any other reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "if (paladin->ExecuteHolyPowerSpender(nullptr)) {\n    // Spell executed\
      \ successfully\n    paladin->AddComboPoint();\n} else {\n    // Failed to execute\
      \ due to insufficient holy power\n    paladin->DoCastSpell(ability);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle when
    the paladin has sufficient holy power available. The method assumes that the paladin
    object maintains an internal state tracking current holy power levels and available
    abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the paladin has sufficient holy power before calling this
    method to avoid unnecessary execution failures. This method may not be thread-safe
    if called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
