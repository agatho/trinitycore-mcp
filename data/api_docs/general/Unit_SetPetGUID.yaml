  signature: void Unit::SetPetGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the unit's pet
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the pet associated
    with the unit. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to manage pet ownership and tracking within the game world. The method typically
    updates internal pet-related data structures and may trigger related events or
    notifications depending on the context. This operation is essential for maintaining
    proper pet state management, especially when changing pet ownership or during
    pet summoning processes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the pet to be set. This value represents
      the specific pet instance in the game world and must be a valid GUID for the
      current pet being managed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetPetGUID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with validation
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nif (unit && unit->GetPetGUID() != 0)\n{\n   \
      \ unit->SetPetGUID(12345);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the pet's state
    within the game world. It may trigger updates to related data structures and is
    often used in conjunction with other pet management methods like SetOwnerGUID
    or SetPetName. Performance considerations are minimal, but thread safety should
    be ensured when multiple threads access this method concurrently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet state tracking,
    potentially causing issues with pet ownership or game mechanics. Care must be
    taken to ensure the GUID value is valid and corresponds to an actual pet in the
    game world.
