documentation:
  brief: Sets the sheath state of the unit to control weapon visibility.
  description: This method controls the sheath state of a Unit, determining whether
    its weapons are shown or hidden. It affects the visual representation of the unit's
    equipped weapons and is commonly used during combat actions, spell casting, or
    when transitioning between different states. The method directly influences the
    unit's animation and visual appearance in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: sheathed
    description: The sheath state to set for the unit. Valid values are SheathState::SHEATH_NONE,
      SheathState::SHEATH_OFF, or SheathState::SHEATH_ON, representing different weapon
      visibility states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetSheath(SheathState::SHEATH_OFF);

      // This will show the weapon

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat state example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetSheath(SheathState::SHEATH_ON);

      // This will hide the weapon during combat

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other unit state management
    methods. It's important to note that setting sheath state affects both visual
    appearance and gameplay mechanics related to weapon visibility.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause visual inconsistencies or unexpected
    behavior during combat, especially if not properly synchronized with other unit
    state changes.
