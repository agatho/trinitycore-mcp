  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetGroupThreatStatus
  signature: GroupThreatStatus ThreatCoordinator::GetGroupThreatStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current threat status of the group within the threat coordinator
    system.
  description: The GetGroupThreatStatus method returns the aggregate threat status
    for the entire group managed by the ThreatCoordinator. This status indicates how
    the group's overall threat level is being evaluated in the context of combat and
    aggro management. The returned GroupThreatStatus enum typically reflects whether
    the group is considered to be in a high, medium, or low threat state, which can
    influence mob targeting behavior and AI decision-making. This method is commonly
    used by combat systems and threat management logic to determine appropriate actions
    based on the group's current threat posture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupThreatStatus enum value representing the overall threat level of
    the group. Possible values may include HIGH_THREAT, MEDIUM_THREAT, LOW_THREAT,
    or NO_THREAT depending on the implementation and current combat state of the group
    members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GroupThreatStatus status = threatCoordinator.GetGroupThreatStatus();\n\
      if (status == GroupThreatStatus::HIGH_THREAT)\n{\n    // Handle high threat\
      \ scenario\n    // e.g., prepare for mob switching or defensive actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "void UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    GroupThreatStatus status = threatCoordinator.GetGroupThreatStatus();\n\
      \    switch (status)\n    {\n        case GroupThreatStatus::HIGH_THREAT:\n\
      \            // Prioritize threat reduction or tank switching\n            break;\n\
      \        case GroupThreatStatus::MEDIUM_THREAT:\n            // Monitor and\
      \ maintain current threat levels\n            break;\n        case GroupThreatStatus::LOW_THREAT:\n\
      \            // Continue normal combat operations\n            break;\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or threat recalculations.
    The returned status may be cached internally and updated only when necessary to
    avoid performance overhead. Developers should understand that the threat status
    reflects the collective state of all group members rather than individual player
    threat levels.
  warnings: The method assumes the ThreatCoordinator has been properly initialized
    with a valid group context. Calling this method outside of combat or with an empty
    group may return undefined behavior or default values. Ensure proper synchronization
    if accessed from multiple threads.
