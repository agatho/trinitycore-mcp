  class: DemonologyDemonTracker
  method: SummonWildImps
  signature: void DemonologyDemonTracker::SummonWildImps(uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a specified number of wild imps for a demonology warlock.
  description: The SummonWildImps method is responsible for creating and summoning
    a given number of wild imps, which are temporary summoned creatures that serve
    as a core mechanic in the demonology specialization. This method typically handles
    the creation of these imp minions, their initial positioning, and integration
    into the warlock's current summoning state. The summoned imps will remain active
    until their duration expires or are explicitly dismissed by the player. This functionality
    is integral to the demonology class's ability to control multiple demonic servants
    simultaneously.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of wild imps to summon. Must be a positive integer value,
      typically between 1 and 4 depending on the warlock's talent level and available
      summoning capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SummonWildImps Usage
    code: 'DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker = player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker();

      tracker->SummonWildImps(2); // Summons 2 wild imps'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional SummonWildImps Based on Talent Level
    code: 'DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker = player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker();

      uint32 impCount = player->HasTalent(12345) ? 4 : 2; // 4 imps if talent is learned

      tracker->SummonWildImps(impCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the warlock's summoning system and may
    be restricted by cooldowns or resource requirements. The summoned imps are typically
    managed through the player's pet system and will follow standard pet behavior
    patterns such as attack targeting, movement, and combat AI.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of available summoning capacity
    or talent levels may result in unexpected behavior or failure to summon imps.
    Ensure that the warlock has sufficient resources (such as soul shards) before
    invoking this method.
