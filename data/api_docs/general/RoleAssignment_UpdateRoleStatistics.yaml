  brief: Updates the statistical data associated with a player's role assignment in
    the game.
  description: The UpdateRoleStatistics method is responsible for recalculating and
    refreshing the statistical metrics tied to a player's assigned role within the
    TrinityCore framework. This typically involves updating performance indicators,
    contribution scores, or other role-specific data that may be used for balancing,
    rewards, or gameplay mechanics. The method ensures that all role-related statistics
    are synchronized with the current state of the player's activities and achievements.
    It is commonly invoked when a player's role changes or when periodic updates are
    required to maintain accurate gameplay data.
