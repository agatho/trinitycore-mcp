  method: GetHeightTolerance
  signature: float LineOfSightManager::GetHeightTolerance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the height tolerance value used for line-of-sight calculations in
    the LineOfSightManager.
  description: The GetHeightTolerance method retrieves the configured height tolerance
    value that determines how much vertical difference is allowed when performing
    line-of-sight checks. This value is crucial for determining whether an object
    or point is obstructed by terrain, structures, or other entities in the game world.
    The tolerance value affects the precision of visibility calculations and can influence
    NPC behavior, spell targeting, and player interaction mechanics. This method is
    typically used internally by the pathfinding and visibility systems to ensure
    accurate line-of-sight determinations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the height tolerance in game units (likely yards
    or meters). This value defines the maximum vertical distance that a line-of-sight
    ray can deviate from the direct path before being considered obstructed. Typical
    values are small positive numbers, often less than 1.0.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve height tolerance for debugging
    code: 'float tolerance = lineOfSightManager->GetHeightTolerance();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("maps", "Current height tolerance: %f", tolerance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The height tolerance is usually set during system initialization and remains
    constant during runtime. This value directly impacts performance of line-of-sight
    calculations, as higher tolerance values may reduce the number of precise checks
    needed but could lead to less accurate visibility results.
