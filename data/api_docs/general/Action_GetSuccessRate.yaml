  class: Action
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float Action::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate of the action as a floating-point
    value between 0.0 and 1.0.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the probability that an action will
    succeed based on various factors such as player skills, item quality, spell effects,
    or environmental conditions. This value is typically used in game logic to determine
    whether an attempted action (like crafting, casting a spell, or performing a skill
    check) should be successful. The returned float represents a normalized success
    chance where 0.0 indicates no chance of success and 1.0 indicates guaranteed success.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability
    of action success. Values closer to 1.0 indicate higher likelihood of success,
    while values near 0.0 suggest failure is almost certain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Action Execution
    code: "if (action->GetSuccessRate() > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with action execution\n\
      \    action->Execute();\n} else {\n    // Notify player of failed attempt\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"Your attempt fails.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Rate for Skill Progression
    code: "float successRate = action->GetSuccessRate();\nif (successRate >= 0.9f)\
      \ {\n    // Award bonus experience or skill points\n    player->AddSkillPoints(skillId,\
      \ 5);\n} else if (successRate < 0.3f) {\n    // Apply penalty for repeated failures\n\
      \    player->ApplyPenalty();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex calculations including character stats, buffs/debuffs,
    and game mechanics. It's recommended to cache the result if the same value is
    needed multiple times within a single frame or logic cycle.
  warnings: Do not assume that a high success rate guarantees action completion; external
    factors such as randomization or server-side modifiers may still cause failure.
