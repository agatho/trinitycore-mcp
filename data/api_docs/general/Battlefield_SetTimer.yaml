  class: Battlefield
  method: SetTimer
  signature: void Battlefield::SetTimer(int timer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the timer value for the battlefield instance.
  description: The SetTimer method configures the internal timer of a Battlefield
    object, which is typically used to manage game events such as capture point timers,
    battle duration, or cooldown periods. This method directly modifies the timer
    state without returning any value. The timer value is usually expressed in milliseconds
    and can be used by the battlefield's update loop to trigger specific actions at
    predetermined intervals. This method is commonly invoked during battlefield initialization
    or when certain game events occur that require resetting or updating the timer.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The new timer value in milliseconds to set for the battlefield instance.
      This value determines how long the battlefield will wait before triggering time-based
      events or transitioning to a new state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 30-second timer
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->SetTimer(30000); // Set timer to 30 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting battlefield timer during capture event
    code: "void OnCapturePointTaken(Battlefield* bf)\n{\n    // Reset the timer when\
      \ a capture point is taken\n    bf->SetTimer(60000); // Set to 1 minute\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Battlefield object.
    It should only be called from within the game's main thread or when thread safety
    is guaranteed, as battlefield timers are often accessed by multiple systems during
    updates. The timer value set here typically affects how long until the next scheduled
    event in the battlefield's lifecycle.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect timing logic. Ensure that the timer value passed is appropriate for
    the intended game mechanics and does not exceed system limitations. This method
    should not be used to directly manipulate timers during active battlefield updates
    without proper synchronization.
