  brief: Sends initial reputation data to the player's client upon login or faction
    change.
  description: The SendInitialReputations method is responsible for transmitting a
    player's current reputation state to their client when they log in or when their
    faction status changes. This includes all known factions, their standing levels,
    and any reputation modifiers that should be visible to the player. The method
    ensures that the client's UI accurately reflects the character's relationship
    with various factions in the game world. It typically gets invoked during the
    player login sequence or when a player's faction data is refreshed.

  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core during player session
    initialization. It sends a complete set of reputation data to avoid synchronization
    issues between server and client states.
