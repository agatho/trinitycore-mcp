  class: NeuralLayer
  method: Forward
  signature: void NeuralLayer::Forward(const int & input)
documentation:
  brief: Processes input data through the neural layer to compute and store output
    values for subsequent layers
  description: The Forward method executes the forward propagation step of a neural
    network layer. It takes an input value, applies the layer's weights and activation
    function, and computes the output that can be passed to the next layer in the
    network. This method is typically used during inference or training when data
    flows from input nodes through the network. The method modifies internal state
    variables of the NeuralLayer instance and does not return any value. It assumes
    that the layer has been properly initialized with weights, biases, and activation
    parameters before calling.
  parameters:
  - name: input
    description: The input value to be processed by the neural layer. This represents
      the output from the previous layer in the network or the raw input feature for
      the first layer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Forward Propagation
    code: 'NeuralLayer layer;

      // Assume layer is initialized with weights and biases

      float input = 0.5f;

      layer.Forward(input); // Processes the input through the layer'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sequential Layer Processing
    code: 'NeuralLayer inputLayer, hiddenLayer, outputLayer;

      // Initialize all layers

      float inputValue = 1.0f;

      inputLayer.Forward(inputValue); // First layer processes input

      hiddenLayer.Forward(inputLayer.GetOutput()); // Hidden layer processes previous
      output

      outputLayer.Forward(hiddenLayer.GetOutput()); // Output layer processes hidden
      layer output'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the NeuralLayer has been properly
    initialized with weights, biases, and activation parameters. The method modifies
    internal state variables and is not thread-safe. It's recommended to ensure that
    no other threads are accessing or modifying the same layer instance during execution.
  warnings: Calling Forward without proper initialization of the layer may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. This method does not validate input ranges,
    so invalid inputs could lead to unexpected outputs or numerical instability. Avoid
    calling this method concurrently on the same layer instance from multiple threads.
