  method: GetModMagnitude
  signature: float MovementForces::GetModMagnitude() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the magnitude of movement forces applied to an object.
  description: The GetModMagnitude method computes the total magnitude of all active
    movement forces acting on a given object. This value represents the combined effect
    of various force components such as gravity, friction, acceleration, or external
    influences that affect the object's motion. The result is typically used in physics
    simulations and movement calculations within the TrinityCore framework to determine
    how much influence these forces have on an entity's displacement over time. The
    method does not modify any internal state but provides a read-only view of the
    current force magnitude.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the computed magnitude of all active movement
    forces. This value is typically non-negative and reflects the total strength of
    the forces acting on the object in question.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MovementForces forces;

      // Assume forces are populated with various force components

      float magnitude = forces.GetModMagnitude();

      // Use magnitude for further calculations or debugging'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void UpdatePlayerMovement(Player* player)\n{\n    MovementForces& forces\
      \ = player->GetMovementForces();\n    float totalMagnitude = forces.GetModMagnitude();\n\
      \    if (totalMagnitude > 0.0f)\n    {\n        // Apply movement adjustments\
      \ based on force magnitude\n        player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, totalMagnitude\
      \ * 0.1f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a calculation involving all active forces and may involve
    floating-point operations that could introduce minor precision differences depending
    on the order of force application. It is recommended to cache this value if it's
    used frequently in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: The returned magnitude may not reflect instantaneous changes if force
    components are updated asynchronously. Ensure that any dependent logic accounts
    for potential timing discrepancies between force updates and magnitude retrieval.
