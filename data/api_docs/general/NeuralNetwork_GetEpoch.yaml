  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: GetEpoch
  signature: uint32_t NeuralNetwork::GetEpoch() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current epoch count of the neural network training process
  description: The GetEpoch method retrieves the number of complete passes (epochs)
    the neural network has completed during its training cycle. This value typically
    increments each time the network has processed the entire training dataset once.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method would be used to
    monitor training progress or determine when to stop training based on epoch thresholds.
    The returned value is a monotonically increasing integer that starts from zero
    and increases with each epoch completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the current epoch count. This value indicates
    how many full iterations of the training dataset have been processed by the neural
    network. A return value of 0 indicates that no epochs have been completed yet,
    while higher values indicate progressive training completion.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Training Progress
    code: 'NeuralNetwork* network = new NeuralNetwork();

      // ... training setup ...

      uint32_t currentEpoch = network->GetEpoch();

      printf("Training epoch: %u\n", currentEpoch);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Control Training Termination
    code: "NeuralNetwork* network = new NeuralNetwork();\n// ... training setup ...\n\
      while (network->GetEpoch() < 1000) {\n    // Continue training\n    network->TrainStep();\n\
      }\nprintf(\"Training completed after %u epochs\\n\", network->GetEpoch());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other neural network training
    metrics to provide comprehensive monitoring of the learning process. The epoch
    count may be reset or modified by specific training configurations, so developers
    should verify the expected behavior based on their implementation.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a read-only value and does not modify
    internal state. If used in a multi-threaded environment, ensure proper synchronization
    if other threads might modify the epoch count during the call.
