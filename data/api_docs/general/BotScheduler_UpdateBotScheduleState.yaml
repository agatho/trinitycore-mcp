  class: BotScheduler
  method: UpdateBotScheduleState
  signature: void BotScheduler::UpdateBotScheduleState(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the scheduled state of a bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The UpdateBotScheduleState method is responsible for refreshing or
    recalculating the current schedule state of a specific bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function likely handles the logic for determining whether a bot
    should be active, inactive, or transitioning between states based on predefined
    scheduling rules. It may also manage internal timers, state transitions, and synchronization
    with the game world's time system. The method operates on a single bot identified
    by its unique global identifier (GUID), ensuring that only the specified bot's
    schedule is updated without affecting other bots in the system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier of the bot whose schedule state needs
      to be updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot instance within the
      system, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Schedule State for a Specific Bot
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      scheduler.UpdateBotScheduleState(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically by the game loop or through a dedicated
    scheduler thread to ensure that bots maintain their correct scheduled behavior.
    It may involve internal locking mechanisms if multiple threads access bot data
    concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this function with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing bot before
    invoking this method.
