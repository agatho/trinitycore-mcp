documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest validation state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method in the QuestValidation class is responsible for processing
    and maintaining the state of quest validations within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during the game loop to handle periodic updates
    related to quest progress, completion checks, or validation status changes. It
    processes time-based events that may affect quest states, such as timers, cooldowns,
    or time-sensitive conditions. The method uses the provided delta time (diff) parameter
    to determine how much time has passed since the last update, allowing for accurate
    time-based quest logic execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n\
      \    sQuestValidation->Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should not be
    called directly by most subsystems. The diff parameter represents milliseconds
    elapsed since last update, which is standard for TrinityCore's update system.
    Performance considerations include ensuring that quest validation logic doesn't
    block the main thread for extended periods.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended game loop context as it
    may lead to inconsistent quest states or unexpected behavior. The method assumes
    valid time deltas and does not perform bounds checking on the diff parameter.
