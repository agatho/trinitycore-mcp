  method: CalculateThreat
  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateThreat(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat level of the bot towards a specified target
    unit.
  description: The CalculateThreat method computes the current threat value that the
    bot has generated against a specific target unit within the game world. This value
    is typically used by the AI system to determine which units are prioritized for
    attack or which targets should be avoided. The calculation may take into account
    various factors such as damage dealt, aggro mechanics, and the bot's current combat
    state. This method is essential for maintaining proper threat management in bot-controlled
    creatures and ensuring realistic AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat level towards the target
    unit. Higher values indicate greater threat, with typical ranges varying based
    on the game mechanics and the specific implementation of the threat calculation
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Calculation
    code: "float threat = botThreatManager->CalculateThreat(targetUnit);\nif (threat\
      \ > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Target is highly threatened, prioritize attacking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on the bot's current
    actions and the target's state. It may be called frequently during combat updates
    to maintain accurate threat levels for AI decision-making.
