  signature: void PlayerBannedAppend::PlayerBannedAppend(const int & moderator, const
    int & banned)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player ban entry to the database with specified moderator and banned
    player IDs.
  description: 'The PlayerBannedAppend method is used to record a new ban instance
    in the game''s database. It takes two integer parameters representing the unique
    identifiers of the moderator who issued the ban and the player being banned. This
    method typically serves as part of the administrative system for managing player
    restrictions within the World of Warcraft server environment. The operation modifies
    the database to reflect the ban event, which may trigger additional game mechanics
    such as disconnecting the banned player or updating their account status. Precondition:
    Both moderator and banned IDs must correspond to valid entries in the database.
    Postcondition: A new ban record is created with associated metadata including
    timestamp and administrative details.'
  parameters:
  - name: moderator
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the player or administrator who issued
      the ban. Must be a valid existing account ID in the database.
  - name: banned
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the player being banned. Must correspond
      to an existing player character in the database.
  returns: null

  notes: This method likely performs database operations and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections of code. It assumes that the provided IDs are
    valid and exist in the respective tables (accounts and characters). The actual
    implementation may involve transaction handling to ensure data consistency.
  warnings: Using invalid or non-existent player IDs can lead to database errors or
    inconsistent states. Ensure proper validation of input parameters before calling
    this method to prevent unexpected behavior.
