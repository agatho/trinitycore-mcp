  method: Meets
  signature: bool CriteriaDataSet::Meets(const Player * source, const WorldObject
    * target, uint32 miscValue1, uint32 miscValue2) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether the specified criteria dataset is met by the given player
    and target objects with optional miscellaneous values.
  description: The Meets method determines if a set of criteria defined in a CriteriaDataSet
    is satisfied by a specific player and target. It takes into account various conditions
    such as player state, target type, and additional data passed via miscValue parameters.
    This method is commonly used in achievement systems, quest tracking, and other
    game mechanics that require conditional evaluation of player actions or states.
    The method performs internal checks against the criteria rules and returns true
    if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise false. It does not modify any state
    and can be called multiple times without side effects.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being evaluated against the
      criteria. This represents the player who triggered or is associated with the
      condition check.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that serves as the target of the criteria
      evaluation. This could be an NPC, GameObject, Item, or other world object relevant
      to the criteria being checked.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: Optional miscellaneous value used for additional context in criteria
      evaluation. The meaning of this value depends on the specific criteria type
      and may represent quantities, types, or identifiers related to the condition
      being evaluated.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: Second optional miscellaneous value that can provide further context
      for criteria evaluation. Like miscValue1, its interpretation is dependent on
      the specific criteria definition and may carry additional data needed for complex
      conditions.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether all criteria in the dataset are met. Returns
    true if the source player satisfies all conditions defined in this criteria set
    when evaluated against the target object and provided miscellaneous values; returns
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check achievement criteria
    code: "CriteriaDataSet* dataSet = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaDataSet(12345);\nif\
      \ (dataSet && dataSet->Meets(player, target, 0, 0)) {\n    // Criteria met -\
      \ grant reward or update progress\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom misc values
    code: "CriteriaDataSet* dataSet = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaDataSet(54321);\nuint32\
      \ damageAmount = 1000;\nuint32 spellId = 45678;\nif (dataSet && dataSet->Meets(player,\
      \ target, damageAmount, spellId)) {\n    // Specific damage type and amount\
      \ criteria met\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the achievement system and quest
    management components. It's important to note that the method performs deep checks
    on the criteria data structure and may involve complex condition evaluation logic.
    The method should not be called with null pointers for source or target, as this
    could lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to source or target parameters; doing so may
    cause crashes or undefined behavior. The method assumes valid player and world
    object references. Be aware that performance can vary depending on the complexity
    of the criteria dataset being evaluated.
