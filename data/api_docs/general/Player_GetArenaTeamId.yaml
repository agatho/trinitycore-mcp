  class: Player
  method: GetArenaTeamId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetArenaTeamId(uint8 param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the arena team ID for the specified slot.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of an arena team that the
    player is a member of, based on the specified slot number. The method is commonly
    used in arena-related gameplay mechanics to determine which team a player belongs
    to, particularly when dealing with rated battlegrounds and arena competitions.
    It provides access to the arena team information without requiring additional
    database queries or complex operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the arena team for the specified
    slot, or 0 if the player is not a member of any arena team in that slot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 teamId = player->GetArenaTeamId(0);\nif (teamId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player is a member of an arena team\n    // Do something with the team ID\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other arena-related methods
    to manage player's arena team membership. It may return 0 if no arena team exists
    for the specified slot, which can happen when a player hasn't joined any arena
    teams yet or has left all teams.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may return 0 if the player
    is not a member of any arena team in that slot. Care should be taken to avoid
    using this method in scenarios where the player's team membership is uncertain,
    especially during arena season transitions.
