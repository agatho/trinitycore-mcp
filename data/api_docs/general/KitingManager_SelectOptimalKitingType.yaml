  class: KitingManager
  method: SelectOptimalKitingType
  signature: KitingType KitingManager::SelectOptimalKitingType(const KitingContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the optimal kiting type based on the provided kiting context.
  description: The SelectOptimalKitingType method determines the most appropriate
    kiting behavior for a creature or NPC based on the current kiting context. This
    includes evaluating factors such as distance to target, movement speed, attack
    range, and environmental constraints. The method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to ensure that creatures perform realistic and effective kiting maneuvers
    during combat. It considers various kiting strategies like aggressive kiting,
    defensive kiting, or stationary kiting depending on the situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a KitingType enum value indicating the selected kiting behavior.
    Possible values may include KITING_TYPE_AGGRESSIVE, KITING_TYPE_DEFENSIVE, or
    KITING_TYPE_STATIONARY based on the evaluation of the context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// ... populate context with relevant data ...\n\
      KitingType type = kitingManager.SelectOptimalKitingType(context);\nswitch (type)\n\
      {\n    case KITING_TYPE_AGGRESSIVE:\n        // Handle aggressive kiting logic\n\
      \        break;\n    case KITING_TYPE_DEFENSIVE:\n        // Handle defensive\
      \ kiting logic\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle stationary or\
      \ other kiting types\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system in TrinityCore and should be
    called during combat decision-making cycles. The implementation likely involves
    complex logic to evaluate multiple factors simultaneously, which may impact performance
    if called too frequently without proper caching or optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the KitingContext passed to this method is properly initialized
    before calling, as invalid or incomplete context data may lead to incorrect kiting
    behavior decisions. This method should not be used outside of combat scenarios
    where kiting logic is relevant.
