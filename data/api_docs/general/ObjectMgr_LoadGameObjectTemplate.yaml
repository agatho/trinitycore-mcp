documentation:
  brief: Loads all game object templates from the database into memory for use in
    the world.
  description: The LoadGameObjectTemplate method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the ObjectMgr class with game object template information retrieved
    from the database. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    reloading game object definitions. It processes entries from the gameobject_template
    table, storing relevant properties such as display ID, type, faction, flags, and
    other attributes necessary for creating and managing game objects in the world.
    The loaded templates are used by the GameObject class to instantiate objects with
    appropriate configurations based on their template IDs.

  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadGameObjectTemplates()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadGameObjectTemplate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during server startup and should not
    be called repeatedly in normal operation. It's thread-safe as it's designed to
    run during single-threaded initialization phases. The method relies on database
    connections being established before execution.
