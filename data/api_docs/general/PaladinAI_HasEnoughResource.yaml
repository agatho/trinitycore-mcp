  class: PaladinAI

  signature: bool PaladinAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the paladin has sufficient resource requirements to cast a specified
    spell
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the PaladinAI instance
    has adequate resource allocation (such as mana, rage, or holy power) to execute
    a given spell. This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes
    to determine spell viability before attempting to cast. It considers the current
    resource state of the paladin and compares it against the resource cost of the
    specified spell. The method returns true if all required resources are available,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper spell selection
    logic in paladin AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to entries in the game's spell database and determines
      the specific resource costs associated with casting that spell.
  returns: Returns true if the paladin has sufficient resources (mana, rage, holy
    power, etc.) to cast the specified spell; returns false if any required resource
    is insufficient.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (paladinAI->HasEnoughResource(20271)) // Judgement of Light\n{\n   \
      \ // Proceed with casting\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(20271);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 85673; // Word of Glory\nif (paladinAI->HasEnoughResource(spellToCast))\n\
      {\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(spellToCast);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle insufficient\
      \ resources\n    paladinAI->TryNextBestSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the paladin's current resource pool and
    compares against spell-specific resource costs defined in the game's spell database.
    It may also consider temporary resource modifiers or buffs that affect casting
    requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell in the
    game database, as invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect resource
    calculations.
