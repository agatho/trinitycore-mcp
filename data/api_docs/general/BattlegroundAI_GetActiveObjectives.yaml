  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetActiveObjectives
  signature: int BattlegroundAI::GetActiveObjectives(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active objectives in the battleground.
  description: The GetActiveObjectives method returns the number of currently active
    objectives within the battleground instance. This method is typically used by
    battleground AI systems to determine how many objectives (such as flags, bases,
    or capture points) are currently in play. The method may be called during battleground
    updates or state checks to ensure proper objective tracking and scoring. It does
    not modify any internal state but provides read-only access to the current objective
    count.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be populated with the player's ID
      associated with the objectives. This parameter is optional and may be NULL if
      only the count is required.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of active objectives in the
    battleground. A return value of zero indicates no active objectives, while a positive
    integer indicates the number of objectives currently in play.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int activeCount = bgAI->GetActiveObjectives(nullptr);\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process active objectives\n    printf(\"There are %d active\
      \ objectives\\n\", activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Player ID Retrieval
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nint count = bgAI->GetActiveObjectives(&playerId);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player %d has %d active objectives\\n\", playerId,\
      \ count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from battleground update loops or state change
    handlers. The player parameter can be used to retrieve the associated player ID
    for specific objectives, though it's not required for basic functionality.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlegroundAI instance is valid and initialized before
    calling this method. Calling this on a destroyed or uninitialized battleground
    may result in undefined behavior.
