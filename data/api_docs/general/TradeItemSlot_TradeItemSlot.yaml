documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new trade item slot instance with default values.
  description: The TradeItemSlot constructor initializes a new trade item slot object,
    setting up internal state for tracking items in a player's trade window. This
    method is typically called when creating a new trade slot to hold an item being
    offered for trade between two players. The constructor ensures that the slot starts
    with valid default values, including initializing item references and trade state
    flags. It prepares the slot for subsequent operations such as adding items, validating
    trades, or updating trade status during the trading process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new trade item slot
    code: 'TradeItemSlot* slot = new TradeItemSlot();

      // The slot is now initialized and ready to be used in a trade

      slot->SetItem(itemGuid, itemEntry);

      // Add item to the trade slot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal trade system implementation. Developers
    should not directly instantiate TradeItemSlot objects; instead, they should use
    the appropriate trade manager methods that handle slot creation and management
    automatically.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of TradeItemSlot objects outside of the trade system's
    internal logic may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The trade system expects
    proper initialization through its managed interfaces.
