documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FormationMember object with default values.
  description: The FormationMember constructor initializes a new instance of the FormationMember
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the formation member, typically
    initializing member variables to their default values or null states. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, FormationMember objects are used to represent
    individual units within a formation, such as pets or summoned creatures that follow
    a specific formation pattern. The constructor ensures that the object is in a
    valid initial state before any other operations are performed on it.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FormationMember instance
    code: 'FormationMember member;

      // member is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when creating
    formation members. Developers should not need to explicitly call this constructor
    unless they are implementing custom formation logic or unit behavior. The initialization
    performed by this constructor may include setting up internal pointers, initializing
    counters, or preparing data structures needed for formation management.
