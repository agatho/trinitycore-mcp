  class: KitingManager
  method: GenerateKitingPattern
  signature: KitingPattern KitingManager::GenerateKitingPattern(KitingType type, const
    KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a kiting pattern based on the specified kiting type and context
    for NPC movement behavior.
  description: The GenerateKitingPattern method creates and returns a KitingPattern
    object that defines how an NPC should move in a kiting pattern, typically used
    for combat or evasive maneuvers. The pattern is determined by the provided KitingType
    enum value and the contextual data from the KitingContext parameter. This method
    is essential for implementing dynamic movement behaviors in AI-controlled creatures,
    particularly when simulating realistic combat movement patterns such as circling,
    weaving, or retreating. The generated pattern can be used by the AI system to
    guide NPC movement during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of kiting pattern to generate, determining the movement
      behavior (e.g., circular, zigzag, retreat). Must be a valid KitingType enum
      value.
  - name: context
    description: The contextual data required for generating the kiting pattern, including
      position, target information, and movement constraints. This parameter provides
      environmental and situational context for the generated pattern.
  returns: A KitingPattern object containing the movement instructions and parameters
    needed to execute the specified kiting behavior. Returns an empty or default pattern
    if invalid inputs are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Generate a circular kiting pattern
    code: 'KitingContext context;

      context.targetPosition = player->GetPosition();

      context.selfPosition = npc->GetPosition();

      context.radius = 10.0f;


      KitingPattern pattern = kitingManager.GenerateKitingPattern(KitingType::Circular,
      context);

      // Use the generated pattern for NPC movement'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generate a retreat kiting pattern with custom parameters
    code: 'KitingContext context;

      context.targetPosition = player->GetPosition();

      context.selfPosition = npc->GetPosition();

      context.retreatDistance = 15.0f;

      context.maneuverSpeed = 2.0f;


      KitingPattern pattern = kitingManager.GenerateKitingPattern(KitingType::Retreat,
      context);

      // Apply the retreat pattern to NPC movement logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when an NPC needs
    to adjust its movement behavior in response to combat situations. The KitingContext
    should be updated regularly with current positions and target data for realistic
    movement patterns. Performance is generally good, but repeated calls without context
    updates may result in suboptimal kiting behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the KitingContext parameters are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or outdated position data can lead to erratic
    NPC movement. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper
    caching of results.
