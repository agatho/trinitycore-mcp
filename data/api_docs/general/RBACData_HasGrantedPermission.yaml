documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific permission is granted to the player
  description: This method determines whether a given permission ID has been granted
    to the player within the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system. It is used to
    verify access rights for various game features, commands, or actions. The method
    performs a lookup in the internal permission storage of the RBACData object and
    returns true if the specified permission exists in the granted set, false otherwise.
    This check is fundamental for enforcing security and access control within TrinityCore's
    permission framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified permission ID is present in the granted permissions
    list, false if it is not granted or if the permission ID does not exist in the
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permission Check
    code: "if (rbacData.HasGrantedPermission(1234)) {\n    // Player has the 'teleport'\
      \ permission\n    SendTeleportCommand();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Command Execution
    code: "void ExecutePlayerCommand(Player* player, uint32 commandId) {\n    RBACData*\
      \ rbac = player->GetRBACData();\n    if (rbac && rbac->HasGrantedPermission(RBAC_PERM_COMMANDS))\
      \ {\n        // Execute the command\n        ProcessCommand(commandId);\n  \
      \  } else {\n        player->SendNotification(\"You do not have permission to\
      \ execute this command.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other RBAC methods like
    GrantPermission and RevokePermission. The permission IDs are usually defined in
    the RBAC system constants or loaded from database tables. Performance-wise, this
    operation is generally fast as it uses optimized data structures for permission
    lookups.
  warnings: Be aware that permission IDs must be valid and registered within the RBAC
    system; checking for an invalid permission ID may return false even if the player
    should logically have access. Also, ensure that RBACData is properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
