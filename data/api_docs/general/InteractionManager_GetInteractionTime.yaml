  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetInteractionTime
  signature: uint32 InteractionManager::GetInteractionTime(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interaction time value for a specified bot player.
  description: The GetInteractionTime method retrieves the interaction time associated
    with a given bot player. This value typically represents a timestamp or duration
    related to how long the player has been interacting with an NPC or object within
    the game world. The method is const, indicating it does not modify any internal
    state of the InteractionManager instance. It accepts a pointer to a Player object
    representing the bot and returns a uint32 value that likely corresponds to milliseconds
    or game ticks since last interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose interaction
      time is being retrieved. Must not be null.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the interaction time for the specified bot
    player. This value typically indicates elapsed time in milliseconds or game ticks
    since last interaction event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve interaction time
    code: "uint32 interactionTime = interactionManager->GetInteractionTime(botPlayer);\n\
      if (interactionTime > 0) {\n    // Process the interaction time value\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot has been interacting for \" << interactionTime << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI logic to determine whether a bot should
    continue interacting with an NPC or object based on time thresholds. The returned
    value may be compared against configured timeouts to decide when to terminate
    interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The interaction
    time value should be interpreted in context of the game's time system (e.g., milliseconds
    vs game ticks).
