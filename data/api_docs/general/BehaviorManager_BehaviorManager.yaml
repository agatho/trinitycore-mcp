documentation:
  brief: Moves a BehaviorManager object, transferring its resources to a new instance.
  description: The BehaviorManager move constructor transfers all managed resources
    from the source BehaviorManager object to the newly constructed object. This operation
    is typically used when passing or returning BehaviorManager objects by value,
    allowing efficient resource transfer without deep copying. The source object becomes
    invalid after the move and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this constructor supports efficient management of behavior state machines
    and their associated data structures during object lifecycle operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to the source BehaviorManager object to be moved
      from.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a BehaviorManager instance
    code: 'BehaviorManager manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      BehaviorManager manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor called

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Returning a BehaviorManager from a function
    code: "BehaviorManager createBehaviorManager() {\n    BehaviorManager bm;\n  \
      \  // ... initialize bm ...\n    return bm; // Move constructor used for return\
      \ value optimization\n}\n\n// Usage:\nBehaviorManager manager = createBehaviorManager();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed to be efficient
    and avoid deep copying of potentially large data structures. After moving, the
    source object should not be accessed as its state is undefined but valid.
  warnings: Do not use the source BehaviorManager after moving it. Accessing moved-from
    objects leads to undefined behavior. Ensure that any pointers or references to
    the moved object are invalidated.
