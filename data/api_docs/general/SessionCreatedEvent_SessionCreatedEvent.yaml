  class: SessionCreatedEvent
  method: SessionCreatedEvent
  signature: void SessionCreatedEvent::SessionCreatedEvent(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    sess, int req)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new session created event with the provided bot session and
    request ID.
  description: The SessionCreatedEvent constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SessionCreatedEvent class. It takes a shared pointer to a BotSession object and
    an integer request identifier as parameters. This event is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to notify systems when a new bot session has been successfully
    created. The method sets up internal state to track the session and associated
    request, enabling proper event handling and resource management throughout the
    session lifecycle. The constructor does not perform any validation on the input
    parameters; it simply stores them for later use by other methods in the class.
  parameters:
  - name: sess
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that was created. This
      parameter represents the newly initialized session which may contain connection
      details, authentication information, or other session-specific data.
  - name: req
    description: An integer identifier representing the request associated with this
      session creation event. This value is typically used to correlate the event
      with a specific client request or operation that triggered the session creation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SessionCreatedEvent Initialization
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>();

      int requestId = 12345;

      SessionCreatedEvent event(session, requestId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SessionCreatedEvent in Event Handler Context
    code: "void OnBotSessionCreated(std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session) {\n    int\
      \ requestId = GetNextRequestId();\n    SessionCreatedEvent event(session, requestId);\n\
      \    // Process the event or queue it for later handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the framework when a bot
    session is successfully established. The shared_ptr parameter ensures proper memory
    management and prevents premature destruction of the session object. Developers
    should be aware that this class likely implements copy semantics, so copying events
    may result in multiple references to the same session data.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it does not return any value and cannot throw
    exceptions. However, passing null shared_ptr values could lead to runtime errors
    if other methods attempt to access the session object without proper null checking.
    Ensure that the session parameter is valid before constructing the event.
