  class: Unit
  method: StopMoving
  signature: void Unit::StopMoving()
documentation:
  brief: Halts all movement for the unit, preventing further motion updates and ensuring
    the unit remains stationary.
  description: The StopMoving method is used to immediately halt any ongoing movement
    for a Unit, whether it's a player or NPC. This function stops all movement-related
    activities including pathfinding, movement updates, and prevents the unit from
    continuing to move in its current direction. It is commonly used when an action
    needs to be performed while the unit is stationary, such as casting spells or
    engaging combat. The method ensures that the unit will not move until explicitly
    restarted through other movement methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->StopMoving();

      // Unit is now stationary'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Scenario Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->StopMoving();

      // Unit stops moving during combat

      // Prevents movement during spell casting'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    functions to ensure that a unit remains stationary. It should be used carefully
    as it may interfere with normal gameplay mechanics if not properly managed.
  warnings: Improper use of StopMoving can cause units to remain stuck or unable to
    resume movement, especially if not followed by appropriate movement restart methods.
