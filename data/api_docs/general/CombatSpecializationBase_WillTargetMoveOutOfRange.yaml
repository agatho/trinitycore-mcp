  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: WillTargetMoveOutOfRange
  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::WillTargetMoveOutOfRange(::Unit * target,
    uint32 timeMs) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a target unit will move out of attack range within the specified
    time period.
  description: The WillTargetMoveOutOfRange method evaluates whether a given target
    unit is likely to move beyond the combat specialization's effective attack range
    before the specified time interval elapses. This method is typically used by AI
    systems and combat logic to make decisions about when to initiate or delay attacks,
    or to determine if a spell or ability should be cast immediately. It takes into
    account the target's current movement speed, direction, and estimated path to
    predict future positioning. The method does not modify any state but provides
    a predictive assessment based on the unit's movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose movement
      is being evaluated. Must be a valid pointer to an existing unit in the game
      world.
  - name: timeMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds over which to predict the target's
      movement. This value determines how far into the future the prediction extends.
  returns: Returns true if the target is predicted to move out of attack range within
    the specified time period; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->WillTargetMoveOutOfRange(target,\
      \ 1000))\n{\n    // Target will move out of range within 1 second\n    // Consider\
      \ casting a ranged ability or moving closer\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with spell casting logic
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec && spec->WillTargetMoveOutOfRange(target, 2500))\n{\n    // Target will\
      \ move out of range in 2.5 seconds\n    // Cast a spell that can be cast while\
      \ moving or has extended range\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENERGY_BOLT,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the target unit's current movement data and assumes
    linear motion for prediction purposes. It does not account for complex pathfinding
    or obstacles in the environment. The accuracy of predictions depends heavily on
    the target's movement state and consistency of speed.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also note that this
    method only provides a prediction based on current movement data; actual movement
    may vary due to external factors like terrain or combat actions.
