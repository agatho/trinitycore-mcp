  notes: This method is typically used during item initialization or when creating
    items for players. It's important to note that the played time value should be
    set appropriately based on game mechanics requirements, as it affects item expiration
    and progression tracking.
  warnings: Improperly setting this value may cause issues with item progression tracking
    and could affect gameplay mechanics related to item expiration. Care should be
    taken when setting this value in relation to other item properties.
