  class: Minion
  method: GetFollowAngle
  signature: float Minion::GetFollowAngle() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the follow angle of the minion in radians.
  description: The GetFollowAngle method retrieves the angular offset that a minion
    uses when following its master. This value determines the relative positioning
    of the minion around the master during movement. The returned angle is expressed
    in radians and represents the direction the minion should maintain relative to
    its master's facing direction. This method is commonly used in AI behavior calculations
    for pet and guardian positioning logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the follow angle in radians. Typically ranges
    from 0 to 2*PI, though exact values depend on the minion's specific AI configuration
    and movement behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float angle = minion->GetFollowAngle();

      // Use the angle for positioning calculations

      float x = masterX + cos(angle) * distance;

      float y = masterY + sin(angle) * distance;'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Positioning Calculation
    code: "if (minion->IsFollowing()) {\n    float followAngle = minion->GetFollowAngle();\n\
      \    float distance = 2.0f;\n    float newX = master->GetPositionX() + cos(followAngle)\
      \ * distance;\n    float newY = master->GetPositionY() + sin(followAngle) *\
      \ distance;\n    minion->SetPosition(newX, newY, master->GetPositionZ(), 0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may return cached
    values. The angle value is usually set during minion initialization or when the
    follow behavior is activated. For summoned creatures, this angle can be influenced
    by the summoner's pet behavior settings.
  warnings: The returned angle represents a relative offset, not an absolute direction.
    When using this value for positioning calculations, ensure proper coordinate system
    conversion if needed. This method should only be called on valid minion instances
    to avoid undefined behavior.
