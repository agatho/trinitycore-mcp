  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: ExecuteFuryRotation
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::ExecuteFuryRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the fury warrior's combat rotation against a specified target.
  description: The ExecuteFuryRotation method implements the core AI logic for a Fury
    Warrior class in TrinityCore. It determines and executes the appropriate sequence
    of abilities based on current combat state, resource levels, and target conditions.
    This method typically involves managing rage generation, applying buffs and debuffs,
    and selecting optimal attack combinations to maximize damage output. The function
    operates within the context of the player's AI behavior tree and is invoked during
    active combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      Must be a valid target within the warrior's aggro range and line of sight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void FuryWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecuteFuryRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::ExecuteFuryRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for rage\
      \ requirements and execute appropriate abilities\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_RAGE)\
      \ >= 10)\n    {\n        if (me->HasAura(SPELL_BLOODTHIRST))\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \        else\n            DoCast(target, SPELL_BLOODTHIRST);\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the warrior is in combat and has a
    valid target. The implementation assumes that the warrior's current state (rage,
    buffs, cooldowns) are properly maintained by the AI system. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary spell checks or target validation within this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the target is valid may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the warrior has sufficient rage and that abilities
    are not on cooldown before invoking this method in custom implementations.
