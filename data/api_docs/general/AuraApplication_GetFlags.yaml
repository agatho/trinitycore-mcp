  class: AuraApplication
  method: GetFlags
  signature: uint16 AuraApplication::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with this aura application.
  description: The GetFlags method returns a 16-bit unsigned integer containing various
    flag bits that define the behavior and properties of the aura application. These
    flags typically indicate whether the aura is active, visible, passive, or has
    specific effects such as being harmful or beneficial. The returned value can be
    used to check for specific aura states or to determine how the aura should be
    processed within the game engine. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the combined flags of this aura application.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag that defines the
    aura's behavior, such as whether it's active, visible, or has certain effects.
    Common flag values may include AURA_FLAG_NONE, AURA_FLAG_VISIBLE, AURA_FLAG_NOT_CASTER,
    etc., depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Aura is Visible
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    uint16 flags = auraApp->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & AURA_FLAG_VISIBLE)\n\
      \    {\n        // Aura is visible to the player\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Aura Type Based on Flags
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    uint16 flags = auraApp->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & AURA_FLAG_NOT_CASTER)\n\
      \    {\n        // This aura affects targets other than the caster\n    }\n\
      \    else if (flags & AURA_FLAG_PASSIVE)\n    {\n        // This is a passive\
      \ aura that doesn't require explicit activation\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are typically defined as constants in the TrinityCore codebase,
    such as AURA_FLAG_VISIBLE, AURA_FLAG_NOT_CASTER, etc. Developers should be aware
    that these flags may change between different versions of TrinityCore and should
    consult the current source code for exact definitions. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from const data members.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned flag value directly; it's a copy of the internal
    state. If you need to change aura flags, use appropriate setter methods or aura
    modification functions instead. Incorrectly interpreting flag bits can lead to
    unexpected behavior in aura application logic.
