  signature: void LootCoordination::TrackLootHistory(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item, Player * recipient)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks loot history for a group when an item is awarded to a recipient.
  description: The TrackLootHistory method records information about loot distribution
    within a group context. It logs details such as which player received which item
    and when, enabling features like loot tracking, audit trails, and historical data
    for group-based loot systems. This method is typically invoked during the loot
    coordination process to maintain a record of all loot assignments within a group.
    The method does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but serves as a logging
    utility for administrative and analytical purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that received
      the loot. Must be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being distributed. This includes item ID, stack size, and other loot properties.
  - name: recipient
    description: Pointer to the Player object who received the loot. Must be a valid
      player instance within the group, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot History Tracking
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      LootCoordination::TrackLootHistory(group, item, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Loot in a Group Context
    code: "if (Group* group = player->GetGroup()) {\n    LootItem item;\n    item.itemid\
      \ = 67890;\n    item.count = 3;\n    TrackLootHistory(group, item, player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system and should be called
    after a successful loot assignment. It does not perform any validation on input
    parameters beyond ensuring they are non-null. The actual logging mechanism may
    depend on internal configuration settings or debugging flags.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for group or recipient will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player is actually part of the group before
    calling this method to avoid inconsistencies in loot tracking.
