  class: Unit
  method: GetMeleeAnimKitId
  signature: uint16 Unit::GetMeleeAnimKitId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the melee animation kit ID associated with the unit's current attack
    state.
  description: This method returns the unique identifier for the melee animation kit
    that is currently active for the unit, which determines the specific animation
    used during melee attacks. The value represents a numeric ID that corresponds
    to predefined animation sets in the game's animation database. This method is
    typically used by AI systems and combat mechanics to determine how a unit should
    animate its melee attacks, particularly when dealing with different weapon types
    or attack states. It can be useful for debugging or customizing behavior in scripts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the melee animation kit ID, which corresponds
    to an animation set defined in the game's database. This ID typically maps to
    specific animations such as 'attack', 'swing', or 'special' depending on the unit's
    weapon type and attack state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 animKitId = unit->GetMeleeAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle animation based on kit ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is commonly used in conjunction
    with other combat-related methods. It may return zero if no active melee animation
    is set, or if the unit is not currently engaged in melee combat.
  warnings: The returned value may be zero if the unit is not actively attacking or
    if the animation kit hasn't been properly initialized. Care should be taken when
    using this method in AI scripts to ensure proper handling of edge cases where
    the unit might not have a valid animation kit set.
