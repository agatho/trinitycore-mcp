  method: GetFollowMode
  signature: FollowMode LeaderFollowBehavior::GetFollowMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current follow mode configuration of the leader-follower behavior.
  description: The GetFollowMode method returns the active follow mode that defines
    how a creature or unit follows its leader within the TrinityCore AI system. This
    mode determines the behavior pattern, such as whether the follower maintains a
    specific distance, stays close to the leader, or follows a predefined path. The
    returned FollowMode enum value indicates the current state of the follow behavior,
    which can be used by AI scripts to adjust strategy or respond to changes in the
    follower's state. This method is typically called during AI update cycles to ensure
    proper positioning and movement logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FollowMode enumeration value representing the current follow behavior
    mode. Possible values include standard modes like FOLLOW_MODE_NORMAL, FOLLOW_MODE_DEFENSIVE,
    or FOLLOW_MODE_OFFENSIVE depending on how the follower is configured to behave
    relative to its leader.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Follow Mode
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_followBehavior)\n    {\n\
      \        FollowMode mode = m_followBehavior->GetFollowMode();\n        if (mode\
      \ == FOLLOW_MODE_NORMAL)\n        {\n            // Perform normal following\
      \ logic\n        }\n        else if (mode == FOLLOW_MODE_DEFENSIVE)\n      \
      \  {\n            // Adjust defensive positioning\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from within AI update routines
    without additional synchronization. The returned FollowMode value may change dynamically
    based on external conditions such as combat state, leader movement, or scripted
    events.
