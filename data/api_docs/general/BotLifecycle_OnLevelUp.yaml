  signature: void BotLifecycle::OnLevelUp(uint32 newLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Handles bot level-up events and updates bot attributes accordingly
  description: The OnLevelUp method is invoked when a bot character reaches a new
    level in the game. This method manages the internal state updates required for
    bots, including adjusting their stats, abilities, and behavior patterns to match
    their new level. It ensures that bots maintain appropriate progression mechanics
    consistent with player characters while preserving their unique AI behaviors.
    The method typically executes during level-up transitions within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: newLevel
    description: The new level value that the bot has reached. This parameter represents
      the target level to which the bot should be upgraded, and must be a positive
      integer greater than the current level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnLevelUp
    code: "void HandleBotLevelUp(BotLifecycle* lifecycle, uint32 newLevel) {\n   \
      \ lifecycle->OnLevelUp(newLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with level-up event handling
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerLevelUp(Player* player, uint32\
      \ newLevel) {\n        if (player->IsBot()) {\n            BotLifecycle* lifecycle\
      \ = GetBotLifecycle(player);\n            lifecycle->OnLevelUp(newLevel);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    level-up events. Developers should not directly invoke this method unless implementing
    custom bot progression logic. The implementation may involve updating various
    bot attributes such as health, mana, damage output, and AI decision-making parameters.
  warnings: Direct invocation of OnLevelUp without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    bot behavior or state corruption. Ensure that newLevel parameter is valid and
    represents an actual level increase for the bot character.
