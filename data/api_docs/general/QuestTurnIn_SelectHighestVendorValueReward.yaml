  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SelectHighestVendorValueReward
  signature: uint32 QuestTurnIn::SelectHighestVendorValueReward(const int & rewards,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the highest vendor value reward from a list of quest rewards for
    a bot player.
  description: The SelectHighestVendorValueReward method evaluates available quest
    rewards and identifies the one with the highest vendor value. This is commonly
    used in automated quest completion systems where bots need to determine which
    reward provides the most monetary benefit. The method takes into account the player's
    current inventory and quest requirements to make this determination. It is typically
    invoked during quest turn-in processes to optimize reward selection for maximum
    value.
  parameters:
  - name: rewards
    description: An integer reference representing the list or set of available rewards
      for the quest. This parameter likely contains reward identifiers or indices
      that correspond to different reward types.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot player who is
      turning in the quest. The method uses this player's inventory and character
      data to evaluate reward values.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the identifier or index of the highest
    vendor value reward. This value can be used to select and claim that specific
    reward from the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest turn-in logic
    code: 'uint32 selectedReward = questTurnIn.SelectHighestVendorValueReward(rewardList,
      botPlayer);

      // Use selectedReward to claim the best reward

      botPlayer->AddItem(selectedReward, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with automated quest completion system
    code: "if (questTurnIn.CanCompleteQuest(player, questId)) {\n    int rewards =\
      \ player->GetQuestRewardCount(questId);\n    uint32 bestReward = questTurnIn.SelectHighestVendorValueReward(rewards,\
      \ player);\n    player->RewardQuestRewards(bestReward);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through available rewards and compares their
    vendor values to determine the optimal choice. It may also consider item quality,
    stackability, or other factors beyond simple vendor price. The implementation
    might cache reward data for performance optimization in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'rewards' parameter contains valid reward identifiers;
    invalid indices could lead to undefined behavior. The method assumes that all
    rewards have associated vendor values and may not handle cases where vendor prices
    are unavailable or zero.
