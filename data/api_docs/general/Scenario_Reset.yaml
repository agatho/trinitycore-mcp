  signature: void Scenario::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the scenario state to its initial condition, clearing all progress
    and objectives.
  description: The Reset method clears all active scenario progress, resets objective
    states, and reinitializes the scenario to its default starting configuration.
    This method is typically invoked when a player exits a scenario or when the scenario
    needs to be restarted without requiring a full server restart. It ensures that
    all scenario-related data structures are properly reset, including quest progress,
    NPC states, and any temporary variables associated with the scenario instance.
    The method does not affect the underlying scenario template or configuration but
    rather resets the runtime state of the specific scenario instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scenario Reset
    code: 'Scenario* scenario = player->GetSession()->GetScenario();

      scenario->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the scenario is not actively in progress
    or when it's safe to reset all player state. Calling Reset during active scenario
    events may cause unexpected behavior or data corruption.
  warnings: Improper use of this method during active scenario execution can lead
    to inconsistent game state, missing quest objectives, or broken NPC interactions.
    Always verify that the scenario is not currently active before calling Reset.
