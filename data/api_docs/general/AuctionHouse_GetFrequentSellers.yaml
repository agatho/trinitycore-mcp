  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetFrequentSellers
  signature: int AuctionHouse::GetFrequentSellers(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of frequent sellers for a specified item in the auction
    house.
  description: The GetFrequentSellers method returns the number of distinct players
    who have listed a specific item for sale in the auction house within a defined
    time window. This method is used to track item popularity and seller activity.
    The implementation likely queries the auction house database table to count unique
    seller entries for the given item ID, excluding expired or canceled auctions.
    It serves as a utility for auction house statistics and may be used in UI displays
    or game mechanics that depend on seller frequency.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of distinct sellers who have listed
    the specified item in the auction house. Returns 0 if no sellers are found or
    if the item ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get frequent sellers for a common weapon
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nint sellerCount = auctionHouse->GetFrequentSellers(itemId);\n\
      if (sellerCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"%d players are selling this item.\", sellerCount);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No sellers found for this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query and may have performance implications
    if called frequently. It's recommended to cache results when used in high-frequency
    scenarios such as UI updates. The time window for 'frequent' sellers is implementation-defined
    but typically corresponds to recent auction listings.
  warnings: The method assumes valid item IDs are passed; invalid or non-existent
    item IDs may return unexpected results. Be cautious about calling this method
    in performance-critical sections of code without proper caching.
