  signature: bool InventoryManager::UseDrink()
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to use a drink item from the player's inventory, consuming it if
    valid.
  description: The UseDrink method checks if the player has a valid drink item in
    their inventory and attempts to consume it. This method typically handles the
    logic for drinking potions, waters, or other consumable beverages within the game.
    It verifies that the item is usable, checks for any cooldowns or restrictions,
    and performs the necessary actions such as updating the player's stats or applying
    effects. The method returns true if the drink was successfully consumed, and false
    if it failed due to invalid conditions such as no drink in inventory, insufficient
    mana, or other game restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a drink was successfully consumed; otherwise returns false
    if the operation failed due to invalid conditions such as no valid drink item,
    cooldowns, or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UseDrink
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->UseDrink()) {\n    // Drink consumed successfully\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"You drank the beverage.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to consume drink\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      You cannot drink right now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with a drink item
    or uses a command related to drinking. It may internally check for item validity,
    cooldowns, and player state before allowing consumption. The actual effect of
    consuming the drink (e.g., restoring mana, health) is handled by other systems
    in TrinityCore.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without checking if a valid
    drink exists in the inventory first, as it may fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior if no appropriate item is available. Also, ensure that the player's state
    allows for drinking (e.g., not in combat or under certain buffs).
