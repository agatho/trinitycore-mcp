  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: Update
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot performance monitoring state with the specified time delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the BotPerformanceMonitor class by processing the elapsed time delta provided
    in milliseconds. This method typically handles performance metrics collection,
    logging, or triggering alerts based on configured thresholds. It is designed to
    be called regularly during the game loop to maintain up-to-date performance statistics
    for bot behavior and resource usage. The method does not require any specific
    preconditions but should be invoked consistently to ensure accurate monitoring.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      represents how much time has passed and is used to calculate performance metrics
      or trigger time-based events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.Update(50); // Update with 50ms delta'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n    botMonitor.Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or a dedicated update
    thread. It's important to ensure consistent timing for accurate performance measurements.
    The implementation may include internal counters, timers, or logging mechanisms
    that depend on the delta value.
