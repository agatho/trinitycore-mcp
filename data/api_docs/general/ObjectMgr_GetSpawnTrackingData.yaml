  method: GetSpawnTrackingData
  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetSpawnTrackingData(uint32 spawnTrackingId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves spawn tracking data for a specified spawn tracking identifier.
  description: The GetSpawnTrackingData method retrieves a pointer to an array of
    integers that represent spawn tracking data associated with a given spawn tracking
    ID. This functionality is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage
    and access information related to object spawning behavior, such as respawn timers,
    spawn conditions, or other tracking metadata. The returned data is immutable and
    should not be modified directly. The method assumes that the spawn tracking ID
    corresponds to a valid entry in the internal tracking system, and accessing invalid
    IDs may result in undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the spawn tracking
    data for the specified spawnTrackingId. Returns nullptr if no data is found for
    the given ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use spawn tracking data
    code: "const int* trackingData = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnTrackingData(12345);\nif\
      \ (trackingData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the tracking data, e.g., for respawn\
      \ calculations\n    int timer = trackingData[0];\n    int condition = trackingData[1];\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal spawn tracking structures and should only be
    called from within the core game logic or during server initialization. The returned
    data is not guaranteed to remain valid across different game ticks or thread contexts,
    so it's recommended to copy values if they need to persist beyond the scope of
    a single function call.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spawnTrackingId may lead to memory
    access violations or undefined behavior. Always validate the ID before calling
    this method and ensure that the data is properly initialized in the tracking system.
