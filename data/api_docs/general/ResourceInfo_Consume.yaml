  class: ResourceInfo
  method: Consume
  signature: uint32 ResourceInfo::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of resource and returns the actual consumed amount.
  description: The Consume method reduces the available resource count by the specified
    amount, if possible. It ensures that the resource cannot go below zero. This method
    is typically used in game mechanics where players or systems consume resources
    such as mana, rage, energy, or other in-game currencies. The method returns the
    actual amount of resource that was consumed, which may be less than requested
    if insufficient resources are available. This behavior prevents negative resource
    values and maintains game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the actual amount of resource that was consumed. If the requested
    amount exceeds available resources, it returns the remaining available amount.
    If no resources are available, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: 'ResourceInfo resource;

      resource.SetAmount(100); // Assume initial amount is 100

      uint32 consumed = resource.Consume(25); // Consumes 25 resources

      // consumed will be 25, and resource amount is now 75'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming More Than Available
    code: 'ResourceInfo resource;

      resource.SetAmount(10); // Assume initial amount is 10

      uint32 consumed = resource.Consume(15); // Try to consume 15 resources

      // consumed will be 10 (all remaining), and resource amount becomes 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell systems, ability usage, and other game
    mechanics where resources are consumed. It's important to note that the method
    does not throw exceptions but instead gracefully handles insufficient resources
    by returning the maximum possible consumption.
  warnings: Ensure that resource consumption logic doesn't lead to unintended behavior
    such as negative values or excessive resource depletion. Always validate the return
    value if precise control over resource usage is required.
