  class: Map
  method: SetTimer
  signature: void Map::SetTimer(uint32 t)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the map's timer to the specified value, typically used for managing
    update cycles and game world state transitions.
  description: The SetTimer method assigns a new timer value to the Map instance,
    which is commonly utilized in TrinityCore's game loop to control when various
    map-related updates occur. This timer value often represents milliseconds since
    the last update cycle and helps synchronize game events, NPC behavior, and object
    management within the world. The method directly modifies an internal timer member
    variable of the Map class, affecting how frequently the map processes its update
    logic. It is typically called during map initialization or when transitioning
    between different game states that require updated timing information.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The new timer value in milliseconds to set for this map instance.
      This value represents the time elapsed since the last update cycle and is used
      by the game engine to determine when to process map events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Map Timer During Initialization
    code: 'Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      map->SetTimer(5000); // Set timer to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Map Timer Based on Game Events
    code: "void UpdateWorldState(Map* map, uint32 newTime)\n{\n    map->SetTimer(newTime);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for handling time-based events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal timer state that affects how frequently
    the map processes updates. The timer value is often used in conjunction with other
    timing mechanisms like Update() methods to ensure consistent game world behavior
    across different map instances. Be cautious when setting very small timer values
    as they may impact performance.
  warnings: Setting incorrect timer values can cause unexpected behavior in map update
    cycles, potentially leading to missed events or excessive processing. This method
    should only be called with valid time values that make sense within the context
    of the game's timing system.
