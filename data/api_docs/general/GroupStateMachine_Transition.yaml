  method: Transition
  signature: bool GroupStateMachine::Transition(GroupStateTransition transition, Group
    * group)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the group state machine to a new state based on the provided
    transition event.
  description: The Transition method in GroupStateMachine is responsible for managing
    the state changes of a group within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the
    given transition event and attempts to move the group from its current state to
    a new one, returning true if the transition was successful or false if it failed.
    This method is crucial for maintaining proper group behavior during various game
    events such as joining, leaving, disbanding, or changing group leadership. The
    method ensures that state transitions follow defined rules and prevents invalid
    state changes that could lead to inconsistent group behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: transition
    description: The GroupStateTransition enum value representing the type of state
      transition to perform. This defines what action is being taken on the group
      (e.g., GROUP_TRANSITION_JOIN, GROUP_TRANSITION_LEAVE, GROUP_TRANSITION_DISBAND).
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose state is being transitioned. This
      represents the actual group instance that will have its state modified by this
      operation.
  returns: Returns true if the state transition was successfully executed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the requested transition is not
    allowed from the current state or that there was an error during the transition
    process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic group transition example
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   GroupStateMachine& stateMachine = myGroup->GetStateMachine();\n    bool\
      \ success = stateMachine.Transition(GROUP_TRANSITION_JOIN, myGroup);\n    if\
      \ (success)\n    {\n        // Handle successful transition\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Group transition completed successfully\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  // Handle failed transition\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to complete\
      \ group transition\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    when group events occur. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing
    custom group state logic. The method performs validation checks to ensure transitions
    are valid according to the group's current state and game rules.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer will likely result in
    a crash or undefined behavior. Always verify that the group pointer is valid before
    calling Transition. Additionally, some transitions may have side effects such
    as sending packets to players, so ensure proper synchronization if called from
    different threads.
