  class: CoordinationTarget
  method: CoordinationTarget
  signature: void CoordinationTarget::CoordinationTarget(int guid, uint32 prio, ThreatLevel
    threat)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target coordination for a unit with specified GUID, priority, and
    threat level.
  description: The CoordinationTarget method assigns a target to a unit within the
    TrinityCore framework, defining how the unit should respond to threats based on
    priority and threat level. This method is typically used in AI behavior scripting
    to control unit targeting mechanics during combat or non-combat scenarios. The
    method updates internal coordination data structures that influence decision-making
    processes for the targeted unit. It does not directly perform actions but rather
    configures the target state that other systems may later act upon.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to coordinate with.
      Must be a valid object GUID within the world context.
  - name: prio
    description: Priority level for this coordination target, determining the importance
      of targeting this unit relative to others. Higher values typically indicate
      higher priority.
  - name: threat
    description: Threat level associated with the target, indicating how dangerous
      or important the target is in terms of combat relevance. Values usually correspond
      to predefined threat levels such as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Coordination Target Assignment
    code: CoordinationTarget(12345, 100, ThreatLevel::HIGH);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Medium Priority with Low Threat
    code: CoordinationTarget(playerGuid, 50, ThreatLevel::LOW);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI coordination system and should be called from
    within an appropriate AI context. The actual targeting behavior depends on how
    the AI module interprets these parameters. Ensure that the GUID refers to a valid
    object in the current world instance.
  warnings: Incorrect GUID values can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Make
    sure to validate GUIDs before calling this method. Using invalid threat levels
    may cause unexpected targeting decisions.
