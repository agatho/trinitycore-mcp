  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::CleanupInactiveGroups()
documentation:
  brief: Removes inactive player groups from the group manager's tracking system.
  description: The CleanupInactiveGroups method iterates through all currently tracked
    player groups and removes those that have been inactive for a specified period.
    Inactivity is typically determined by checking if the group has no active members
    or if the last activity timestamp exceeds a configured threshold. This method
    helps maintain performance and memory efficiency by preventing stale group data
    from accumulating in the system. The cleanup process ensures that only currently
    relevant groups remain in the manager's internal collections, reducing overhead
    during group-related operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->CleanupInactiveGroups();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the system to maintain clean
    state. It's important to note that this operation affects all groups managed by
    the PlayerbotGroupManager instance, and should be used carefully in performance-sensitive
    contexts.
