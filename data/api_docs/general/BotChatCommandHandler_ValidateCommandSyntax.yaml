  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: ValidateCommandSyntax
  signature: bool BotChatCommandHandler::ValidateCommandSyntax(const CommandContext
    & context, const ChatCommand & command)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the syntax of a bot chat command against expected structure and
    parameters.
  description: The ValidateCommandSyntax method checks whether a given chat command
    issued by a bot adheres to the expected format and parameter requirements. It
    ensures that commands are properly structured before execution, preventing malformed
    or potentially harmful input from being processed. This validation is crucial
    for maintaining system stability and security within the TrinityCore framework's
    bot management system. The method evaluates both the command name and its associated
    arguments against predefined rules to determine syntactic correctness.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The CommandContext object containing information about the current
      command execution environment, including the player, target, and other contextual
      data needed for validation.
  - name: command
    description: The ChatCommand object representing the command to be validated,
      including its name, parameters, and associated handler function.
  returns: Returns true if the command syntax is valid according to the defined rules;
    otherwise returns false if the command fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Validation
    code: "bool isValid = botHandler.ValidateCommandSyntax(context, command);\nif\
      \ (!isValid)\n{\n    // Handle invalid command syntax\n    SendErrorMessage(\"\
      Invalid command syntax.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Command Processing
    code: "void ProcessBotCommand(CommandContext& context, ChatCommand& command)\n\
      {\n    if (ValidateCommandSyntax(context, command))\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with command execution\n        ExecuteCommand(context, command);\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        // Log invalid syntax and notify user\n        LOG_ERROR(\"\
      bot\", \"Invalid command syntax from bot: {}\", command.Command);\n        SendErrorMessage(\"\
      Invalid command syntax.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the pre-processing phase of chat command
    handling in bot systems. It performs syntactic checks only and does not validate
    semantic meaning or permissions. The validation logic may be extended through
    inheritance or configuration files to support custom command structures.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to security vulnerabilities if malformed
    commands are allowed through without proper validation. Always ensure that all
    incoming bot commands are validated before processing, especially when dealing
    with user-provided input.
