documentation:
  brief: Processes aura dispel events for bot AI, handling the removal of harmful
    auras from the bot's target.
  description: The ProcessAuraDispel method is responsible for managing aura dispel
    events within the BotAI system. It evaluates incoming aura events and determines
    whether the bot should attempt to remove or dispel specific auras from its target.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining optimal combat performance, especially
    when dealing with harmful magical effects that could impede the bot's effectiveness.
    The method typically operates as part of the AI's reaction system, responding
    to events triggered by the game engine when auras are applied or removed from
    units. It ensures that the bot can intelligently respond to various aura states
    and maintain its tactical advantage in combat situations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Process any pending aura dispel events\n\
      \    ProcessAuraDispel(m_lastAuraEvent);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the BotAI system when an aura
    event occurs. Developers should ensure that the aura event data passed to this
    method contains valid information about the target and aura type before calling
    it. The method may perform checks for dispel eligibility, target validity, and
    bot resource availability before attempting any dispel actions.
  warnings: Improper handling of aura events can lead to incorrect dispel decisions
    or performance issues. Ensure that the event parameter contains valid data and
    that the bot's current state allows for aura dispelling operations. This method
    should not be called directly with invalid or uninitialized aura event objects.
