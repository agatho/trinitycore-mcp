  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateSeasonalAvailability
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateSeasonalAvailability(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a seasonal quest is currently available for players to accept or
    complete.
  description: The ValidateSeasonalAvailability method determines whether a specific
    quest, identified by its quest ID, is currently within its seasonal availability
    window. This validation ensures that seasonal quests (such as those tied to holidays
    or limited-time events) are only accessible when appropriate. The method likely
    checks against internal game time systems and seasonal event calendars to make
    this determination. It returns true if the quest is currently valid for player
    interaction, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest is currently within its seasonal availability
    period and can be accepted or completed by players; returns false if the quest
    is not currently active due to seasonal restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->ValidateSeasonalAvailability(12345)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ is currently available\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Quest is not currently available\n    player->SendNotification(\"This quest\
      \ is not available at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's seasonal event system and may
    cache results for performance. Developers should be aware that seasonal quests
    might have complex availability rules depending on server time, holiday schedules,
    or other dynamic conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that quest IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to
    actual seasonal quests in the database; invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors.
