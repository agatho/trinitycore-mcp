documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DruidAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The DruidAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    associated with a druid's AI behavior. This includes releasing any allocated memory,
    resetting internal state variables, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or
    invalid references remain after the object is destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this method ensures proper deallocation of memory used by the druid
    AI controller, preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable gameplay performance.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a DruidAI object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of DruidAI Instance
    code: 'DruidAI* druidAI = new DruidAI(creature);

      // ... use the druid AI ...

      delete druidAI; // Triggers ~DruidAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly in most cases, as it is automatically
    invoked during object destruction. Developers should ensure that all references
    to the DruidAI instance are properly managed to prevent memory leaks or use-after-free
    errors.
