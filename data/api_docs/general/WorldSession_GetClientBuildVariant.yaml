  class: WorldSession
  method: GetClientBuildVariant
  signature: const int & WorldSession::GetClientBuildVariant() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the client build variant associated with the current WorldSession.
  description: The GetClientBuildVariant method returns a constant reference to an
    integer representing the build variant of the client that established this WorldSession.
    This value is typically used to identify specific versions or patches of the game
    client, which can be crucial for compatibility checks, feature availability, and
    handling version-specific behaviors in TrinityCore. The returned value corresponds
    to the client's build number as defined by the game's versioning system and may
    influence how certain game mechanics are processed or restricted based on the
    client's capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the client build variant.
    This value typically matches the build number of the connected client, used for
    version-specific logic and compatibility handling within TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Check Client Build Variant
    code: "int buildVariant = session->GetClientBuildVariant();\nif (buildVariant\
      \ == 12345) {\n    // Handle specific client build\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is set during the initial connection handshake and remains
    constant for the duration of the session. It's important to note that this method
    does not perform any validation or transformation on the build variant; it simply
    returns the value received from the client.
