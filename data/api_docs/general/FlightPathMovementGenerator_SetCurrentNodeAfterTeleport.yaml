  method: SetCurrentNodeAfterTeleport
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::SetCurrentNodeAfterTeleport()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current flight path node after a teleportation event.
  description: The SetCurrentNodeAfterTeleport method adjusts the internal state of
    a FlightPathMovementGenerator to reflect the correct current node in a flight
    path following a teleportation. This ensures that the movement generator continues
    along the flight path from the appropriate location rather than restarting or
    skipping nodes. The method is typically invoked when a player is teleported during
    flight, such as when entering a new zone or using certain game mechanics that
    alter their position without normal movement. It recalculates and sets the current
    node index based on the new position relative to the flight path waypoints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage after teleport
    code: 'FlightPathMovementGenerator* generator = ...;

      generator->SetCurrentNodeAfterTeleport();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the movement generator's flight path data is already
    loaded and valid. It internally uses position-based calculations to determine
    the correct node index, so accuracy depends on proper positioning of the unit
    after teleportation.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the unit's new position is within
    the bounds of the flight path may result in incorrect node selection or movement
    behavior. The method should only be called after a valid teleportation has occurred.
