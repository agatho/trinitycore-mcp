documentation:
  brief: Completes a cinematic sequence for the player, clearing cinematic flags and
    resuming normal gameplay.
  description: The HandleCompleteCinematic method is invoked when a client signals
    that it has finished playing a cinematic sequence. This typically occurs after
    a cinematic cutscene has been played, such as those triggered by quest events
    or world events. The method clears internal cinematic state flags for the player,
    allowing them to resume normal gameplay operations including movement, interaction
    with NPCs, and other game mechanics. It ensures that the player's session is properly
    reset from the cinematic mode and that any associated UI elements are dismissed.
    This method is part of the core WorldSession handling system and is automatically
    called by the TrinityCore server upon receiving the appropriate client packet.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCompleteCinematic(WorldPackets::Misc::CompleteCinematic&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Clear cinematic state for the player\n    _player->SetCinematic(0);\n\
      \    // Resume normal gameplay\n    SendPacket(new WorldPackets::Misc::CinematicStop());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's packet handling
    system when a CompleteCinematic packet is received from a client. Developers should
    not directly invoke this method unless implementing custom cinematic logic. The
    method assumes that the player object is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Improper handling of cinematic completion may leave players in an unusable
    state where they cannot interact with the game world. Ensure all cinematic-related
    flags are properly cleared to avoid client-side issues or stuck states.
