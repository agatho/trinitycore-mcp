documentation:
  brief: Removes bind sight auras from the unit.
  description: This method removes all bind sight auras from the specified unit, which
    typically occurs when a player's soul is bound to a location or when certain game
    mechanics are triggered. The method ensures that any existing bind sight effects
    are cleared from the unit's aura list. This functionality is commonly used in
    scenarios where players need to be freed from binding constraints, such as when
    teleporting or when entering a new zone. The removal of these auras may also affect
    the unit's ability to see certain objects or areas that were previously bound
    to them.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->RemoveBindSightAuras();\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it affects the unit's aura state.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other methods that manage player or creature
    auras, and may require synchronization with game mechanics related to binding
    and teleportation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect behavior in game mechanics
    involving binding and sight, potentially causing players to lose access to certain
    objects or areas they should be able to see. Ensure that the unit being modified
    is properly handled before calling this method.
