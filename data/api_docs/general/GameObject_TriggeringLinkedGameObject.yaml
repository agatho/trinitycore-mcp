    target)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a linked game object based on trap entry and target unit.
  description: This method activates a linked game object by using the specified trap
    entry and target unit. It is typically used in conjunction with trigger mechanisms
    that involve linked GameObjects, such as those found in quest objectives or environmental
    triggers. The method allows for precise control over which linked object is activated
    based on the provided parameters, enabling complex interactions between game objects
    and units.
  parameters:
  - name: trapEntry
    description: The trap entry identifier used to determine which linked GameObject
      should be triggered. This value typically corresponds to a specific trap in
      the database that defines the behavior of the linked object.
  - name: target
    description: The target unit that will trigger the linked GameObject. This can
      be any Unit type such as player, creature, or game object, and is used to determine
      the activation context for the linked object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      Unit* target = player;

      uint32 trapEntry = 12345;

      go->TriggeringLinkedGameObject(trapEntry, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      Unit* target = creature;

      uint32 trapEntry = 54321;

      go->TriggeringLinkedGameObject(trapEntry, target);

      // This triggers a linked object based on the trap entry and target unit

      // which may involve complex quest mechanics or environmental triggers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that the GameObject has a valid link to another GameObject
    in the database. The trapEntry must match a specific trap defined in the game
    object's linked entries, and the target unit must be valid for triggering the
    linked object. Performance considerations include ensuring that the target unit
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper validation of the trap
    entry and target unit. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes
    if the linked GameObject does not exist or is not properly initialized. Also,
    be aware that triggering linked objects can cause cascading effects in game mechanics
    if not handled carefully.
