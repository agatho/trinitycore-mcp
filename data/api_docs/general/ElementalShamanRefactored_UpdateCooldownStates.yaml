  method: UpdateCooldownStates
  signature: void ElementalShamanRefactored::UpdateCooldownStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all elemental shaman abilities and spells.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method manages the internal cooldown tracking
    for an Elemental Shaman character. It iterates through all active cooldowns and
    reduces their remaining time, then updates the player's state accordingly. This
    method is typically called during each game tick or when specific events occur
    that might affect cooldowns. The implementation ensures proper synchronization
    of spell cooldowns with the game's timing system, preventing players from using
    abilities before their cooldown periods have expired. It also handles edge cases
    such as resetting cooldowns due to certain buffs, debuffs, or environmental effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    elementalShaman.UpdateCooldownStates();\n\
      \    // ... continue with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Event System
    code: "class CustomEventSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerAction(Player* player)\n\
      \    {\n        if (auto shaman = dynamic_cast<ElementalShamanRefactored*>(player))\n\
      \        {\n            shaman->UpdateCooldownStates();\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain accurate
    cooldown tracking. It's important to note that this method does not directly modify
    spell casting behavior - it only updates internal state. The actual enforcement
    of cooldowns is handled by the core TrinityCore spell system.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game thread without proper
    synchronization, as it may cause race conditions in cooldown state management.
    Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it could impact performance.
