  brief: Returns the X coordinate of the cell within the world grid
  description: The CellX method retrieves the horizontal coordinate (X-axis) of a
    cell in the game world's grid system. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    the world is divided into a grid of cells for efficient object management and
    visibility calculations. This method provides access to the X component of the
    cell's position within that grid. The returned value represents the cell's index
    along the horizontal axis, which is used internally for spatial queries, object
    tracking, and determining which players can see which objects in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the X coordinate of the cell within the world grid
    system. This value corresponds to the cell's position along the horizontal axis
    of the grid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Cell X Coordinate
    code: 'Cell myCell(10, 15);

      int xCoord = myCell.CellX();

      // xCoord will be 10'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Grid-Based Visibility Logic
    code: "Cell currentCell = player->GetCurrentCell();\nint cellX = currentCell.CellX();\n\
      if (cellX > 0) {\n    // Perform operations for positive X coordinates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core grid system implementation in TrinityCore.
    The cell coordinates are typically used in conjunction with CellY() to uniquely
    identify a cell within the world grid. These coordinates are not the same as world
    coordinates but rather represent grid indices that are converted to actual world
    positions for rendering and gameplay calculations.
