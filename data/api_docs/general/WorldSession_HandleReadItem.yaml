documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to read the content of an item, such as a scroll
    or book.
  description: The HandleReadItem method handles incoming packets from the client
    indicating that a player wants to read the text content of an item. This typically
    occurs when a player clicks on items like scrolls, books, or other quest items
    that contain textual information. The method validates the item's usability and
    checks if the player has the required permissions or conditions to access the
    item's content. It then sends back the appropriate response packet containing
    the item's text data or an error message if the read attempt fails.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleReadItem(WorldPackets::Item::ReadItem& readItem)\n\
      {\n    Item* item = GetPlayer()->GetItemByGuid(readItem.ItemGUID);\n    if (!item\
      \ || !item->IsReadable())\n        return;\n\n    // Process item reading logic\
      \ here\n    SendItemTextResponse(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the item interaction system in TrinityCore and relies
    on proper item template flags to determine if an item can be read. The method
    should only be called when a valid packet from the client is received, and it
    assumes that the player's session state has been validated.
  warnings: Improper handling of item reading may lead to security vulnerabilities
    or exploit opportunities. Always validate that the item exists, is readable, and
    that the player has appropriate permissions before sending any content back to
    the client.
