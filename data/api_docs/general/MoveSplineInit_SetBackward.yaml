  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetBackward
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetBackward()
documentation:
  brief: Configures the movement spline to move in the backward direction.
  description: The SetBackward method initializes the MoveSplineInit object to calculate
    and execute movement in the reverse direction. This is typically used when an
    NPC or player needs to move backwards along a predefined path, such as retreating
    from combat or reversing their current trajectory. The method modifies internal
    spline parameters to ensure the movement animation plays correctly in the backward
    orientation. It should be called before initiating the actual movement process
    using the spline.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for NPC Retreat
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init(movementInfo);

      init.SetBackward();

      init.MoveTo(position);

      init.Launch();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the spline's direction but does not immediately start
    movement. It must be followed by a call to MoveTo() and Launch() to execute the
    actual backward movement. The method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts for
    NPCs that need to retreat or reverse their path.
  warnings: Calling SetBackward() after movement has already been initiated may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect animation states. Always ensure this method
    is called before any movement commands are issued.
