  signature: void PhasingHandler::OnAreaChange(WorldObject * object)
documentation:
  brief: Handles phase changes when a WorldObject enters or leaves a new phasing area
  description: The OnAreaChange method is invoked when a WorldObject (such as a player
    or creature) moves into or out of a different phasing area. This method manages
    the phasing state updates for the object, ensuring that the correct phase masks
    are applied and that any necessary visual or gameplay changes occur. It typically
    triggers updates to the object's visibility, interactability, and other phase-dependent
    behaviors within the TrinityCore framework. The method is part of the phasing
    system which allows for dynamic world modifications based on player location or
    game events.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that has triggered the area change event.
      This can be a Player, Creature, or any other object that supports phasing behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAreaChange(WorldObject*\
      \ object) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when area changes\n     \
      \   if (object->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n        {\n            Player*\
      \ player = object->ToPlayer();\n            // Handle player-specific phasing\
      \ updates\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core when an object's
    position changes and crosses a phase boundary. Developers should not manually
    invoke this method unless implementing custom phasing logic. The phasing system
    in TrinityCore uses bitmask-based phase masks to determine visibility and interaction.
  warnings: Improper handling of area change events may lead to incorrect phasing
    behavior, such as objects remaining visible when they should be hidden or vice
    versa. Ensure that any custom phasing logic correctly updates the object's phase
    mask and does not interfere with core phasing systems.
