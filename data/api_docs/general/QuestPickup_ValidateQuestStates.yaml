  signature: void QuestPickup::ValidateQuestStates()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the current quest states for the player and updates the quest log
    accordingly.
  description: The ValidateQuestStates method ensures that all active quests in a
    player's quest log are in a valid state according to the game's quest system.
    It checks for completed objectives, verifies quest prerequisites, and updates
    the player's quest status. This method is typically called during quest interactions,
    such as when a player accepts or turns in a quest, or when the player's state
    changes in a way that might affect quest validity. The method performs internal
    validation without returning any value, directly modifying the quest log and related
    data structures.

      \ pickup.ValidateQuestStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during quest-related events. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom quest logic or debugging quest states.
