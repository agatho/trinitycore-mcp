    management, and combat system interactions. The method returns an integer representing
    the number of active area triggers, which may be zero if no triggers are present
    or a positive value if triggers exist.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the count of active area triggers for the

    to manage active area effects. Performance considerations include checking for
    valid spell IDs before calling this method, as invalid spell IDs may lead to undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be called on units that are not initialized or
    have been destroyed, as it may result in memory access violations or undefined
    behavior.
