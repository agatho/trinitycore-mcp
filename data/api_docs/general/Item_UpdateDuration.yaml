  class: Item
  method: UpdateDuration
  signature: void Item::UpdateDuration(Player * owner, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the duration of an item based on time passed and player's ownership.
  description: The UpdateDuration method adjusts the remaining duration of an item,
    typically used for items with time-based effects such as temporary enchantments
    or consumable items. It modifies the item's duration based on the time elapsed
    since last update, considering the player's ownership status and potentially other
    game mechanics like item timers or cooldowns. This method is crucial for maintaining
    accurate item state in World of Warcraft gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the item. This parameter determines
      the context in which duration is updated, including player's current time and
      ownership status.
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since last update. This value affects
      how much the item's duration should decrease, with larger values leading to
      faster duration reduction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetOwner();

      uint32 timeElapsed = 1000;

      item->UpdateDuration(player, timeElapsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game loop updates and may be invoked
    multiple times per second. It requires accurate timing information to function
    properly.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can cause incorrect duration calculations,
    leading to items that expire too quickly or remain active longer than intended.
