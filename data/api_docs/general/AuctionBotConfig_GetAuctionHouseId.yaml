    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the auction house identifier for the specified auction house type.
  description: The GetAuctionHouseId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) associated
    with a specific auction house type within the TrinityCore auction system. This
    ID is used internally by the AuctionBot to determine which auction house to interact
    with when managing auctions, such as listing items or retrieving auction data.
    The method takes an AuctionHouseType parameter that specifies the type of auction
    house (e.g., Alliance, Horde, or Neutral) and returns the corresponding numeric
    ID. This identifier is essential for proper integration with the game's auction
    house mechanics and ensures correct operation of bot functionalities.
  parameters:
  - name: houseType
    description: The type of auction house to retrieve the ID for. Valid values are
      typically defined by the AuctionHouseType enumeration, which includes types
      such as AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE, AH_TYPE_HORDE, and AH_TYPE_NEUTRAL.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the specified
    auction house type. The returned ID corresponds to the internal database entry
    for that auction house and is used in queries and operations involving auction
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Alliance Auction House ID
    code: 'uint32 allianceId = auctionBotConfig->GetAuctionHouseId(AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE);

      // Returns the ID for the Alliance auction house'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Auction House ID in Bot Logic
    code: "AuctionHouseType type = AH_TYPE_HORDE;\nuint32 id = auctionBotConfig->GetAuctionHouseId(type);\n\
      if (id != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with operations using the Horde auction house\
      \ ID\n    LOG_INFO(\"auctionbot\", \"Using Horde Auction House ID: {}\", id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AuctionBot configuration
    methods to ensure proper interaction with the game's auction system. The returned
    IDs are usually pre-configured based on the server's database entries and should
    not change during runtime unless the auction house configuration is modified.
  warnings: Ensure that the AuctionHouseType parameter passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid values may result in unexpected behavior or incorrect auction house
    operations. Always validate the returned ID before using it in critical auction
    operations.
