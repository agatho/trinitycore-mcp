documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently located in an aquatic zone where
    swimming mounts can be used.
  description: The IsInAquaticZone method checks if the player's current location
    falls within a zone that supports aquatic movement, such as water bodies or underwater
    areas. This is essential for determining whether a player can use swimming-based
    mounts or abilities. The method evaluates the player's position against internal
    zone data to make this determination. It does not require any parameters and returns
    a boolean value indicating the result of this check.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in an aquatic zone where swimming mounts
    are allowed; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (mountManager.IsInAquaticZone()) {\n    // Player can use swimming mount\n\
      \    player->SetCanUseSwimmingMount(true);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot use\
      \ swimming mount\n    player->SetCanUseSwimmingMount(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal zone system of TrinityCore and may not
    account for dynamic environmental changes during runtime. It is recommended to
    cache this value if it's checked frequently in performance-sensitive code paths.
