  class: BotProfiler
  method: SetSessionTargets
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetSessionTargets(uint64_t sessionId, const int & botGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the session targets for a specified bot session using a list of bot
    GUIDs.
  description: The SetSessionTargets method configures the target entities for a given
    bot session by assigning a collection of bot GUIDs. This functionality is typically
    used within the context of AI-driven bot management in TrinityCore, where bots
    need to be directed toward specific targets during gameplay. The method operates
    on a per-session basis and updates internal tracking structures to reflect the
    new target assignments. It does not validate whether the provided GUIDs correspond
    to valid bot entities, so it's expected that callers ensure proper data integrity
    before invoking this method.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the session for which targets are
      being set. This value must be a valid session ID previously registered with
      the system.
  - name: botGuids
    description: An integer reference containing a list or array of bot GUIDs that
      will serve as targets for the specified session. The exact type and structure
      of this parameter should align with the internal representation expected by
      the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64_t sessionId = 12345;

      int botGuids[] = { 1001, 1002, 1003 };

      BotProfiler::SetSessionTargets(sessionId, botGuids);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal session state and may affect how bots behave
    in the game world. It is recommended to call this function only when necessary
    to avoid unnecessary overhead. Ensure that the bot GUIDs provided are valid and
    correspond to active bots.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs may lead to
    undefined behavior or errors during bot execution. Always validate input data
    before passing it to this method.
