documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LFGMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LFGMgr
    class, providing global access to the Looking for Group manager. This manager
    handles all LFG-related functionality including group matching, dungeon finding,
    and queue management. The method ensures that only one instance of LFGMgr exists
    throughout the TrinityCore server runtime, making it accessible from any part
    of the codebase without requiring explicit instantiation. This is essential for
    coordinating LFG activities across different subsystems like player managers,
    dungeon systems, and communication modules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single global instance of LFGMgr. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing LFG Manager for Queue Operations
    code: "LFGMgr* lfgMgr = LFGMgr::instance();\nif (lfgMgr)\n{\n    // Use the LFG\
      \ manager to add player to queue\n    lfgMgr->AddPlayerToQueue(playerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking LFG Queue Status
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = LFGMgr::instance();

      uint32 queuedPlayers = lfgMgr->GetQueuedPlayerCount();

      uint32 activeGroups = lfgMgr->GetActiveGroupCount();

      // Process queue statistics

      LogInfo("LFG: {} players queued, {} groups active", queuedPlayers, activeGroups);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented as a singleton with proper
    initialization during server startup. The LFGMgr instance is created before any
    game logic begins and remains valid throughout the server lifecycle.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned LFGMgr instance,
    as it's managed by the singleton pattern. Accessing this method before server
    initialization may lead to undefined behavior.
