  class: World
  method: HasRecentlyDisconnected
  signature: bool World::HasRecentlyDisconnected(WorldSession * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a world session has recently disconnected from the server.
  description: The HasRecentlyDisconnected method determines whether a specific WorldSession
    object has been marked as recently disconnected. This functionality is typically
    used to prevent duplicate processing of disconnection events or to manage session
    cleanup logic. The method likely maintains an internal tracking mechanism to identify
    sessions that have recently gone offline, which can be useful for handling race
    conditions during player logout or server shutdown scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object to check for recent disconnection
      status. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified session has been marked as recently disconnected,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if no disconnection tracking is active
    or if the session was not recently disconnected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check session status
    code: "if (world->HasRecentlyDisconnected(session)) {\n    // Handle already disconnected\
      \ session\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Session %u is already disconnected.\"\
      , session->GetAccountId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal data structure to track recently disconnected
    sessions. It's important to note that the definition of 'recently' may depend
    on server configuration or timeout thresholds. The implementation might be thread-safe
    if used in a multi-threaded environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldSession pointer passed is valid and not null, as
    passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    this method's logic may change based on how disconnection events are tracked internally
    in different TrinityCore versions.
