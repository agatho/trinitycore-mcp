  class: PossessedAI
  method: PossessedAI
  signature: void PossessedAI::PossessedAI(int * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a possessed AI instance for a creature with the specified script
    ID.
  description: The PossessedAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a creature
    that has been possessed by a player or another entity. This method sets up the
    necessary internal state and configuration required for the possessed creature
    to function correctly within the game world. The AI system will manage the creature's
    actions, responses, and interactions based on its possession state. This initialization
    typically occurs when a creature is under the control of a player through abilities
    like Possess or similar mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that is being possessed. This parameter
      represents the target creature whose AI behavior will be controlled by this
      possessed AI instance.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Identifier for the script associated with this possessed creature.
      This script ID determines which specific AI behaviors and logic will be applied
      to the possessed creature during its possession state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Possessed AI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* possessedCreature = ...; // Get a creature reference

      uint32 scriptId = 12345;

      PossessedAI* ai = new PossessedAI(&possessedCreature, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a creature becomes possessed. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless implementing custom AI behavior or extending existing possession
    mechanics. The AI system handles most of the complex logic related to possession
    state management.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor without proper creature initialization
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the creature pointer is
    valid and properly initialized before passing it to this constructor.
