  signature: void RuneSystem::SetRunicPower(uint32 power)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the runic power value for a player's rune system
  description: The SetRunicPower method updates the current runic power amount stored
    within the RuneSystem. This method is typically used to modify a player's energy
    resource that fuels death knight abilities. The runic power value is usually constrained
    between 0 and 1000, representing the maximum possible runic power. This method
    directly modifies internal state without triggering any additional game events
    or visual effects, making it suitable for direct manipulation during gameplay
    logic or simulation scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The new runic power value to set, typically ranging from 0 to 1000.
      Values outside this range may be clamped or handled according to game logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Runic Power
    code: 'RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();

      runeSys->SetRunicPower(1000); // Set to maximum runic power'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reducing Runic Power for Ability Usage
    code: "RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();\nuint32 currentPower = runeSys->GetRunicPower();\n\
      uint32 cost = 250; // Cost of an ability\nif (currentPower >= cost)\n{\n   \
      \ runeSys->SetRunicPower(currentPower - cost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal runic power state. It does not validate
    the value against current rune cooldowns or ability requirements, so callers should
    ensure proper game logic is maintained elsewhere. The method may be called from
    any thread context, but should ideally be used within the main game thread to
    avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Directly setting runic power values without considering game state or
    cooldowns can lead to inconsistent gameplay behavior. Avoid calling this method
    in rapid succession without proper throttling or validation logic.
