  class: MistweaverSoothingMistTracker
  method: CanInstantCast
  signature: bool MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::CanInstantCast() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Mistweaver can instantly cast Soothing Mist.
  description: The CanInstantCast method evaluates if the current state of the Mistweaver
    class allows for an instant cast of the Soothing Mist ability. This check typically
    considers factors such as cooldown status, resource availability (like mana or
    energy), and any active buffs or debuffs that might prevent or enable an instant
    cast. The method is used internally by the game engine to validate casting conditions
    before allowing a player to use this ability. It ensures that players cannot bypass
    game mechanics by casting Soothing Mist outside of allowed parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mistweaver can instantly cast Soothing Mist, otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates all preconditions for an instant
    cast are met; false means at least one condition prevents the instant cast.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a spell validation context
    code: "if (mistweaverTracker->CanInstantCast()) {\n    // Proceed with instant\
      \ casting logic\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SoothingMist_Instant, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Fall back to normal cast behavior\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SoothingMist_Normal, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during gameplay and should be optimized
    for performance. It may also interact with other systems like cooldown tracking,
    resource management, and aura application.
