  brief: Initializes a new instance of the HolyPowerSystem class.
  description: The HolyPowerSystem constructor initializes a new instance of the HolyPowerSystem
    class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures required for
    managing holy power mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor
    typically handles initialization of member variables, setting default values,
    and preparing the system for subsequent operations such as power generation, consumption,
    or tracking. In the context of World of Warcraft game mechanics, this system likely
    manages the holy power resource used by certain paladin abilities and spells.

  - title: Creating a new HolyPowerSystem instance
    code: 'HolyPowerSystem* holyPower = new HolyPowerSystem();

      // The system is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when creating
    instances of the HolyPowerSystem. Developers should not directly instantiate this
    class unless implementing custom game mechanics or extensions to the core system.
