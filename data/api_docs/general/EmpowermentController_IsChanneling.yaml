documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently channeling an empowerment spell.
  description: The IsChanneling method determines whether the player character is
    actively channeling an empowerment spell. This method is typically used in game
    logic to prevent certain actions while a channeling effect is active, or to manage
    the state of the player's ability usage. The check involves verifying the internal
    state of the EmpowermentController associated with the player. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay mechanics and preventing exploits related
    to overlapping spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently channeling an empowerment spell,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channeling Check
    code: "if (player->GetEmpowermentController()->IsChanneling()) {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot perform certain actions while channeling\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Based on Channeling State
    code: "if (!empowermentController->IsChanneling()) {\n    // Allow casting of\
      \ new empowerment spell\n    empowermentController->StartEmpowermentSpell(spellId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player they are already channeling\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are already channeling an empowerment spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should have minimal performance
    impact. It is recommended to cache the result if checking this condition multiple
    times within a single game tick.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a sole validation for spell casting, as it only
    reflects the empowerment channeling state and not other potential blocking conditions
    such as movement or combat states.
