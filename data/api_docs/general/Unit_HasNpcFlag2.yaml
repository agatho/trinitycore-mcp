  signature: bool Unit::HasNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2 flags) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific NPC flag2 value.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object possesses a particular
    NPCFlags2 flag, which is used to categorize NPC behavior and interactions within
    World of Warcraft. The method is commonly employed in script logic to identify
    specific NPC types or behaviors, such as whether an NPC is a quest giver, vendor,
    or has special AI behavior. It is essential for developers working with NPC interaction
    scripts or AI systems to understand the flags that can be checked using this method.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has the specified NPCFlags2 flag; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->HasNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2::QUEST_GIVER)) {\n    // Perform quest-related\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the NPC flag system in TrinityCore and should be used
    carefully as NPC flags are not always intuitive. The NPCFlags2 enum values are
    defined in the core code and represent specific behaviors or categories for NPCs.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation on the input flag value, so
    developers must ensure that the correct NPCFlags2 enum value is used to avoid
    incorrect results.
