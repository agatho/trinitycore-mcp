documentation:
  brief: Handles extra attack processing for a unit during combat
  description: This method manages the execution of additional attacks when a unit
    performs a melee attack, typically used in conjunction with proc-based mechanics.
    It processes the extra attack behavior based on the victim and count parameters,
    ensuring proper handling of attack sequences and potential additional damage calculations.
    The method is commonly used in combat scenarios where units need to perform extra
    attacks due to various triggers like proc effects or special abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The target unit that the current unit is attacking. This parameter
      defines the combatant and determines the attack target for additional processing.
  - name: count
    description: The number of extra attacks to process. This parameter controls how
      many additional attacks are executed, typically representing the number of procs
      or special effects that trigger extra attack behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* attacker = GetOwner();

      Unit* victim = GetVictim();

      uint32 count = 1;

      attacker->HandleProcExtraAttackFor(victim, count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple extra attacks
    code: 'Unit* attacker = GetOwner();

      Unit* victim = GetVictim();

      uint32 count = 3;

      attacker->HandleProcExtraAttackFor(victim, count);

      // This would process 3 extra attacks for the victim'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat processing and should be used
    carefully to avoid infinite loops or incorrect attack sequences. It's important
    to ensure that the victim parameter is valid and that count represents a reasonable
    number of extra attacks.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect combat behavior,
    including missing or duplicate attacks. Care must be taken when using this method
    in conjunction with other combat-related methods to avoid conflicts.
