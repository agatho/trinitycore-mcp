documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell or item is currently on cooldown
  description: The HasCooldown method determines whether a specific spell or item
    is currently in its cooldown period. This method is used extensively in TrinityCore
    to enforce game mechanics that prevent players from immediately reusing abilities
    or items after they have been activated. The method checks both spell-based and
    item-based cooldowns, making it a central part of the cooldown management system
    within the SpellHistory class. It returns true if the specified spell or item
    is on cooldown, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell to check for cooldown status. A value
      of 0 indicates no spell check should be performed.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the item to check for cooldown status. A value
      of 0 indicates no item check should be performed.
  returns: Returns true if either the specified spell or item is currently on cooldown,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown check for a spell
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->HasCooldown(12345, 0)) {\n    // Spell 12345\
      \ is on cooldown\n    SendSystemMessage(\"This spell is still on cooldown.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking both spell and item cooldowns
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->HasCooldown(12345, 67890)) {\n    // Either\
      \ spell 12345 or item 67890 is on cooldown\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Cannot use\
      \ this ability right now.\");\n} else {\n    // Both are available for use\n\
      \    CastSpell(player, 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. It relies
    on internal cooldown tracking managed by the SpellHistory class. The method does
    not modify any state; it only reads current cooldown information.
  warnings: When both spellId and itemId are non-zero, the method will return true
    if either one is on cooldown. This behavior may lead to unexpected results if
    you intend to check for a specific cooldown type only.
