  class: ThreatManager
  method: IsThreatListEmpty
  signature: bool ThreatManager::IsThreatListEmpty(bool includeOffline) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the threat list is empty, optionally including offline
    players.
  description: This method checks if the ThreatManager's threat list contains any
    entries. It returns true when the list is empty and false when it contains threats.
    The method can optionally include offline players in its evaluation, making it
    useful for determining if a creature or player has any active threats from the
    perspective of the threat manager. This functionality is essential for managing
    combat behavior and ensuring proper threat distribution within World of Warcraft's
    game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat list is empty (no active threats), false otherwise.
    When includeOffline is set to true, it will return true only when there are no
    threats including offline players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (threatManager->IsThreatListEmpty(false)) {\n    // Do something when\
      \ threat list is empty\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat-related logic to determine if a creature
    or player has active threats. It's important to note that the method may return
    false even if no players are actively attacking, as there could be other sources
    of threat such as NPCs or environmental effects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with includeOffline set to true, as
    it may lead to unexpected behavior in certain combat scenarios where offline players
    might be considered as part of the threat list.
