  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: RetryFailedObjective
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::RetryFailedObjective(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Retries a failed quest objective for the specified player and quest.
  description: The RetryFailedObjective method allows a player to retry a previously
    failed quest objective within the Dynamic Quest System. This functionality is
    typically used when a player fails to complete a specific objective in a quest
    and wishes to attempt it again. The method takes the player reference, the quest
    ID, and the index of the failed objective to retry. It resets the objective state
    and allows the player to progress with the quest once more. This method is part
    of the dynamic quest system that enables flexible quest handling within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the failed objective will be
      retried.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest containing the failed objective.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that should
      be retried.
  returns: null

    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      DynamicQuestSystem::RetryFailedObjective(player, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already completed the quest at least
    once and that the objective is marked as failed. The method does not validate
    if the quest or objective exists; it's expected that such checks are performed
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors in quest progression. Ensure that the quest and objective indices are
    valid before invoking this method.
