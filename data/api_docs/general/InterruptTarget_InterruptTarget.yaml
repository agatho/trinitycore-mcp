  method: InterruptTarget
  signature: void InterruptTarget::InterruptTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the target's current spell casting or channeling.
  description: The InterruptTarget::InterruptTarget method is responsible for breaking
    the current spell casting or channeling state of a target unit. This method typically
    interrupts spells that are in progress, such as cast time spells, channeled spells,
    or any ongoing magical effects that require sustained focus. It is commonly used
    in combat scenarios where an attacker needs to disrupt an opponent's spellcasting,
    or when a spell effect is interrupted by external factors like damage or movement.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs the interruption directly
    on the target unit associated with this interrupt handler.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Usage
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\n        {\n           \
      \ // Interrupt the target's current spell\n            InterruptTarget();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI scripts or combat logic to manage
    spell interruption mechanics. It assumes that the target unit exists and is valid
    for interruption. The actual interruption effect depends on the spell's properties
    and the game's internal state management.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid before calling this method, as attempting
    to interrupt a null or invalid target may result in undefined behavior. This method
    should not be called during spell casting or channeling events that are already
    being processed by the game engine.
