  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: MoveToFollowPosition
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::MoveToFollowPosition(BotAI * ai, const int
    & targetPos)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to a follow position relative to its leader using the provided
    target position.
  description: The MoveToFollowPosition method is responsible for calculating and
    executing movement logic that positions the bot at a designated follow location
    relative to its leader within the World of Warcraft environment. This method is
    typically invoked as part of the LeaderFollowBehavior's core functionality, enabling
    bots to maintain formation or proximity to their assigned leader during group
    activities such as dungeons, raids, or questing. The method leverages the BotAI
    context and target position parameter to determine appropriate movement paths,
    handling obstacles and terrain appropriately while ensuring smooth navigation.
    It returns true upon successful initiation of movement or completion of the follow
    action, and false if movement cannot be initiated due to invalid parameters or
    AI state constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot's behavior. This
      parameter provides access to the AI context, including current position, target
      information, and movement capabilities.
  - name: targetPos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target follow position index
      or identifier. This value determines where the bot should position itself relative
      to its leader (e.g., front, back, left, right).
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins moving to the specified follow
    position or completes the movement; returns false if movement cannot be initiated
    due to invalid parameters, AI state issues, or other runtime constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a leader-follow behavior
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (leaderFollowBehavior)\n    {\n     \
      \   int followPosition = 1; // Example: follow behind the leader\n        if\
      \ (!leaderFollowBehavior->MoveToFollowPosition(this, followPosition))\n    \
      \    {\n            // Handle movement failure\n            LOG_ERROR(\"bot\"\
      , \"Failed to move to follow position {}\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic follow position adjustment
    code: "bool AdjustFollowPosition(BotAI* ai, int newPosition)\n{\n    // Validate\
      \ new position\n    if (newPosition < 0 || newPosition > 5)\n        return\
      \ false;\n    \n    // Attempt to move to new follow position\n    return leaderFollowBehavior->MoveToFollowPosition(ai,\
      \ newPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance has a valid leader assigned and
    that the targetPos parameter corresponds to a predefined set of valid follow positions.
    The actual movement pathfinding is handled internally by the AI system, which
    may involve waypoint generation or direct navigation to the calculated position.
    Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency
    updates, as this method might trigger pathfinding calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly initialized leader or invalid targetPos
    values can result in failed movement attempts and potential AI instability. Ensure
    that the BotAI context is fully operational before invoking this method, and validate
    all input parameters to prevent runtime errors.
