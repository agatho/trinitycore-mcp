  signature: bool TradeManager::IsTradingActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a trade is currently active between two players.
  description: The IsTradingActive method determines if there is an ongoing trade
    session between two players in the game. This function typically checks internal
    state flags or trade session data structures to verify that both parties have
    initiated and are still engaged in a trading process. It's commonly used to prevent
    invalid operations during trade negotiations, such as attempting to send additional
    items or accept trades when no trade is currently active. The method returns true
    if a valid trade session exists, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is an active trade session between two players; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:

    code: "if (player->GetTradeData()->IsTradingActive()) {\n    // Proceed with trade\
      \ operations\n    player->SendTradeUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Handle no active\
      \ trade case\n    player->SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_CANCELLED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of a player's trade data
    or trade manager instance. It may internally check for valid trade sessions, active
    trade windows, or synchronization states between trading parties.
