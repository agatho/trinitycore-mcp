documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for the Affliction Warlock's abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets all applicable cooldowns
    for an Affliction Warlock class instance. This typically occurs during character
    initialization, login, or spell reset scenarios within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method ensures that abilities such as Shadow Bolt, Corruption, Unstable Affliction,
    and other warlock spells start with their proper cooldown states. It is part of
    the core AI behavior setup for maintaining game balance and proper spell usage
    timing.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'AfflictionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a warlock's AI. It is typically invoked by the core TrinityCore system when a
    player logs in or when a new warlock NPC is spawned. The implementation may involve
    iterating through spell IDs and setting their cooldown timers to zero or default
    values.
