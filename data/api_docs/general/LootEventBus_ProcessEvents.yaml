documentation:
  brief: Processes pending loot events in the event bus, handling loot distribution
    and related actions.
  description: The ProcessEvents method is responsible for executing queued loot-related
    events within the LootEventBus. It iterates through pending events and processes
    them according to their type and associated logic. This method typically runs
    during game loop updates and ensures that loot distributions, notifications, and
    other loot-related actions are properly handled in a timely manner. The method
    respects a maximum event limit to prevent performance degradation and handles
    timing differences between events. It is commonly invoked by the core game loop
    or subsystems managing loot systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of events successfully processed during this call. A
    value of zero indicates no events were pending or processed, while a positive
    integer shows how many events were handled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    uint32 processedEvents\
      \ = sLootEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff, 100);\n    // ... continue with other\
      \ updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop and should
    not be invoked directly by custom modules unless necessary. The 'maxEvents' parameter
    acts as a safety measure to prevent excessive processing during high-load scenarios.
    Performance can be affected if too many events accumulate in the queue.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very high maxEvents value may cause performance
    hiccups or frame drops during busy periods. Ensure that event processing logic
    within the LootEventBus does not introduce blocking operations or long-running
    tasks.
