  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: NavigateToQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestTurnIn::NavigateToQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Navigates the bot to the specified quest giver's location.
  description: The NavigateToQuestGiver method instructs a player bot to move towards
    the location of a quest giver identified by the provided GUID. This method is
    typically used in AI-driven quest completion systems where the bot needs to physically
    travel to interact with NPCs. It handles pathfinding and movement logic internally,
    ensuring the bot reaches the quest giver's position. The method returns true if
    the navigation process was initiated successfully, or false if the quest giver
    could not be located or if navigation failed for any reason.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will navigate
      to the quest giver.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC to which the
      bot should navigate. Must correspond to a valid GameObject or Creature in the
      game world.
  returns: Returns true if the navigation process was successfully started and the
    bot is moving toward the quest giver. Returns false if the quest giver could not
    be found, if the bot is already at the destination, or if there was an error during
    navigation setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation to Quest Giver
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player bot\nuint32 questGiverGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nif (QuestTurnIn::NavigateToQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid)) {\n\
      \    // Bot is now moving towards the quest giver\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ started navigating to quest giver.\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to navigate to quest giver.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's pathfinding system and requires that
    the quest giver exists in the game world with a valid location. It does not wait
    for completion; it initiates movement asynchronously.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual NPC
    or GameObject in the world. Failure to do so may result in failed navigation attempts
    and potential performance issues due to invalid pathfinding requests.
