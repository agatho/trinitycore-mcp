documentation:
  brief: Cancels an auction item in the auction house system
  description: The ExecuteCancelAction method handles the cancellation of a player's
    auction item from the auction house. It verifies that the auction belongs to the
    specified player and that the auction is still active before removing it from
    the auction house database. This method is typically invoked when a player chooses
    to cancel their own auction listing, either because they no longer wish to sell
    the item or because they want to retrieve it immediately. The method ensures proper
    cleanup of auction data and may trigger notifications or updates to the auction
    house UI.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player's identifier (GUID) who owns the auction being
      canceled. Must be a valid pointer to an integer representing the player's unique
      ID.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction item to be canceled. This value
      corresponds to the auction entry in the database and must reference an existing
      active auction.
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully canceled and removed from
    the system, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the auction
    does not exist, is already sold, or belongs to another player.
  examples:
  - title: Canceling a Player's Auction
    code: "uint32 auctionId = 12345;\nint playerId = 67890;\nbool result = auctionHouse->ExecuteCancelAction(&playerId,\
      \ auctionId);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Auction successfully canceled\n    printf(\"\
      Auction %u has been canceled\\n\", auctionId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to\
      \ cancel auction\n    printf(\"Failed to cancel auction %u\\n\", auctionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and auction data are valid and accessible.
    It should only be called after verifying that the player has permission to cancel
    the auction. The method may involve database operations and should be used with
    care in performance-sensitive contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that
    the auctionId corresponds to a valid and active auction to prevent errors or data
    inconsistencies.
