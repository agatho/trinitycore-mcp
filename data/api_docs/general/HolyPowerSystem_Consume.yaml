api:
  class: HolyPowerSystem
  method: Consume
  signature: bool HolyPowerSystem::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of holy power from the system and returns whether
    the operation was successful.
  description: The Consume method reduces the current holy power level within the
    HolyPowerSystem by the specified amount. This method is typically used in game
    mechanics where actions consume holy power, such as divine spells or abilities.
    The method checks if sufficient holy power exists before consuming it. If the
    requested amount exceeds the available holy power, the operation fails and returns
    false without modifying the system state. This ensures that holy power cannot
    go into negative values.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to consume from the system. Must be a
      non-negative integer representing the amount of power units to deduct.
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of holy power was successfully consumed;
    otherwise, returns false if there is insufficient holy power available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Holy Power Consumption
    code: "if (holypowerSystem.Consume(5)) {\n    // Successfully consumed 5 units\
      \ of holy power\n    printf(\"Holy power consumed successfully.\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Not enough holy power available\n    printf(\"Insufficient holy\
      \ power to consume.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Consumption
    code: "uint32 requiredPower = 10;\nif (holypowerSystem.GetHolyPower() >= requiredPower)\
      \ {\n    if (holypowerSystem.Consume(requiredPower)) {\n        // Execute spell\
      \ or ability that requires holy power\n        printf(\"Spell cast successfully\
      \ using %u holy power.\\n\", requiredPower);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetHolyPower() to check
    available resources before attempting consumption. It's important to note that
    this method does not directly interact with player objects or game events; it
    simply modifies internal holy power state.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent unexpected behavior. Calling this method with a zero value will always
    return true but perform no action.
