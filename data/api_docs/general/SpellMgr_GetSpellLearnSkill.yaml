    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill node associated with a spell's learnable skill.
  description: The GetSpellLearnSkill method retrieves the SpellLearnSkillNode structure
    that defines the skill and skill level required to learn a specific spell. This
    is used in the context of spell learning mechanics, particularly for skills like
    professions, secondary skills, or abilities that require prerequisite knowledge.
    The returned node contains information about which skill is associated with the
    spell and at what minimum skill level the spell becomes available. If no skill
    association exists for the given spell ID, the method returns a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a SpellLearnSkillNode structure that defines the skill and
    required skill level for the spell, or nullptr if no such association exists.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell requires a specific skill to learn
    code: "const SpellLearnSkillNode* skillNode = sSpellMgr->GetSpellLearnSkill(12345);\n\
      if (skillNode != nullptr)\n{\n    printf(\"Spell requires skill ID %u at level\
      \ %u\\n\", skillNode->skill_id, skillNode->skill_value);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      No skill requirement for this spell\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell learning checks and validation.
    The SpellLearnSkillNode structure likely contains fields such as skill_id, skill_value,
    and possibly other metadata related to the prerequisite skill. This method does
    not perform any database lookups itself but relies on pre-loaded data structures
    within the SpellMgr.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell_id passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    spell in the game's database; invalid IDs may return null pointers without error
    reporting. The returned pointer should never be modified directly as it points
    to internal static data.
