  class: AoEDecisionManager
  method: GetGridNeighbors
  signature: int AoEDecisionManager::GetGridNeighbors(const int & pos, float radius)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of grid neighbors within a specified radius
    for a given position.
  description: The GetGridNeighbors method determines how many neighboring grid cells
    are within a defined radius from a specified position. This is commonly used in
    AI decision-making systems to evaluate spatial relationships between entities
    and their surrounding environment. The method operates on a grid-based system
    where positions are mapped to grid coordinates, and neighbors are calculated based
    on the radius provided. It's typically employed in pathfinding, area-of-effect
    targeting, or spatial awareness calculations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method assumes that the internal grid structure and position mapping have
    been properly initialized before calling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of grid neighbors within the
    specified radius. A return value of zero indicates no neighbors were found within
    the radius, while a positive integer indicates the number of valid neighboring
    grid cells that fall within the defined range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int neighborCount = decisionManager.GetGridNeighbors(12345, 10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Decision Logic
    code: "if (decisionManager.GetGridNeighbors(playerPosition, 5.0f) > 3) {\n   \
      \ // Execute area-of-effect spell\n    CastAOESpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal grid system being properly initialized
    and assumes that position coordinates are compatible with the grid mapping. Performance
    may vary depending on the complexity of the grid structure and the radius size.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters, so calling
    with invalid positions or negative radii may produce unexpected results.
  warnings: This method should only be called after ensuring that the AoEDecisionManager
    has been properly initialized with a valid grid system. Using this method without
    proper setup can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect neighbor counts. The
    radius parameter is interpreted in world units, so care must be taken when converting
    between different coordinate systems.
