documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all Pandaria dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior
    system
  description: The LoadPandariaDungeons method is responsible for initializing and
    loading all dungeon configurations specific to the Pandaria expansion content.
    This method sets up the internal data structures required for managing dungeon
    behaviors, difficulty settings, and quest triggers associated with Pandaria dungeons
    such as Stormstout Brewery, Scholomance, and other expansion-specific instances.
    It typically runs during server startup or when the Pandaria content module is
    activated, ensuring that all relevant dungeon mechanics are properly registered
    and available for player interaction. The method does not require any parameters
    and performs its operations internally using predefined dungeon templates and
    configuration data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadPandariaDungeons();

      // Dungeon data is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    enabling Pandaria content. It modifies internal state and may not be safe to call
    multiple times without proper cleanup. The method likely reads from database tables
    or configuration files containing Pandaria dungeon definitions.
  warnings: Calling this method after dungeons have already been loaded may result
    in duplicate entries or undefined behavior. Ensure that this method is called
    only once during the application lifecycle, preferably during server startup before
    any player interactions occur.
