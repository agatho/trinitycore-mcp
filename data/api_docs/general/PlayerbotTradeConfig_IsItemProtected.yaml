  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: IsItemProtected
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsItemProtected(uint32 itemEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified item is protected from being traded by player
    bots.
  description: The IsItemProtected method checks if a given item entry is marked as
    protected within the PlayerbotTradeConfig settings. This functionality is used
    in TrinityCore's player bot system to prevent certain items from being traded
    or sold by automated player characters. The method evaluates the internal configuration
    database to determine protection status based on item type, quality, or other
    criteria defined in the trade configuration. It returns true if the item is protected
    and false otherwise, allowing the bot logic to make appropriate decisions during
    trading operations.
  parameters:
  - name: itemEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item to check for protection
      status. This corresponds to the item's entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is protected from trading by player
    bots, false otherwise. A protected item cannot be traded or sold by automated
    player characters according to configured rules.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is protected before attempting to trade
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nif (bot->GetPlayerbotTradeConfig()->IsItemProtected(itemId))\
      \ {\n    // Skip trading this item\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Item %u is protected from trading.\", itemId);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ trade logic\n    bot->PerformTrade(itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal configuration database that defines which
    items should be protected. The protection rules are typically loaded at startup
    or when the configuration is refreshed. Performance is generally good as it uses
    fast lookup mechanisms, but frequent calls may impact performance in high-frequency
    trading scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that itemEntry values are valid and correspond to actual items
    in the game database. Invalid or non-existent item IDs may produce unexpected
    results or cause errors during lookup operations.
