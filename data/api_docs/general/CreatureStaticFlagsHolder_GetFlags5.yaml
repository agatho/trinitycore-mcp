  class: CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
  method: GetFlags5
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags5() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the fifth set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags5 method returns an integer value representing the fifth
    group of static flags stored within the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder class. These
    flags are typically used to define specific behavioral or visual properties of
    creatures in the World of Warcraft environment, such as movement patterns, interaction
    settings, or AI-related configurations. The returned value is a bitmask that can
    be evaluated using bitwise operations to determine individual flag states. This
    method is commonly used during creature initialization and runtime to apply or
    check static configuration values without requiring dynamic updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the fifth set of static flags. Each bit in this
    integer corresponds to a specific flag configuration that defines various aspects
    of the creature's behavior or appearance. The value should be interpreted as a
    bitmask where individual bits indicate enabled features or settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Flag State
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\nint flags5 = flagsHolder.GetFlags5();\n\
      if (flags5 & 0x0001) // Check if first flag is set\n{\n    // Handle special\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Flags in Creature AI Logic
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override\n    {\n        int flags = me->GetCreatureTemplate()->GetStaticFlagsHolder()->GetFlags5();\n\
      \        if (flags & 0x0100) // Check for specific AI flag\n        {\n    \
      \        // Enable custom AI behavior\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple getter operation and does not modify any internal
    state. The flags returned are typically precomputed during creature template loading
    and remain constant throughout the creature's lifetime. Developers should be aware
    that flag values may vary between different versions of TrinityCore or custom
    modifications.
  warnings: Ensure proper bit masking when checking individual flags, as incorrect
    bitwise operations can lead to unexpected behavior. This method assumes the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
    instance is properly initialized; accessing flags on an uninitialized object may
    result in undefined behavior.
