  class: Map
  method: Instanceable
  signature: bool Map::Instanceable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map instance can be used for player instances.
  description: The Instanceable method checks if a Map object is capable of supporting
    player instances. This is typically used to determine if a specific map type (such
    as a dungeon, raid, or battleground) can be instantiated for players to enter
    and play in. The method returns true if the map supports instance creation and
    false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this check
    is crucial for managing different types of game content like dungeons, raids,
    and world instances that may not support player-created instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map can be instantiated for players, false if it cannot.
    This typically applies to maps that are designed as instanceable content such
    as dungeons or raids, but excludes certain world maps or special non-instanceable
    areas.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a map is instanceable before creating an instance
    code: "Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(1234, 0);\nif (map && map->Instanceable())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with instance creation logic\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_INSTANCE_CREATED);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle non-instanceable map case\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_INSTANCE_NOT_ALLOWED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in instance management systems to validate whether
    a map can be properly instantiated for player use. It's often called before attempting
    to create or load an instance of a specific map. The result of this check may
    depend on the map's type, flags, and configuration within the TrinityCore database.
  warnings: Developers should not assume all maps are instanceable. Always verify
    with this method before attempting to create instances, as attempting to instantiate
    non-instanceable maps can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the server
    code.
