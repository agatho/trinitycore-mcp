  class: Conversation
  method: GetStationaryPosition
  signature: const int & Conversation::GetStationaryPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the stationary position index of the conversation.
  description: The GetStationaryPosition method retrieves the stationary position
    index associated with a conversation object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, conversations can have predefined stationary positions that determine
    where NPCs or objects appear during dialogue sequences. This index is typically
    used internally by the game engine to manage positioning logic for stationary
    elements within conversation events. The returned value represents an internal
    identifier that maps to a specific position in the conversation's stationary position
    array.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the stationary position
    index. This index corresponds to a predefined position in the conversation's stationary
    position configuration, typically used for NPC placement or object positioning
    during dialogue sequences.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve stationary position for conversation
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversationById(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    const int& positionIndex = conv->GetStationaryPosition();\n    // Use\
      \ positionIndex to determine NPC placement\n    printf(\"Stationary position\
      \ index: %d\\n\", positionIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with conversation event handling
    and NPC positioning logic. The returned index should be validated against the
    conversation's stationary position configuration to ensure proper positioning
    behavior.
  warnings: The returned reference points to internal data that should not be modified
    directly. Accessing this value after the conversation object has been destroyed
    may result in undefined behavior.
