  method: RegisterMigration
  signature: void PlayerbotMigrationMgr::RegisterMigration(const MigrationInfo & migration)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a migration with the playerbot migration manager for processing.
  description: The RegisterMigration method adds a given MigrationInfo object to the
    internal collection of migrations managed by the PlayerbotMigrationMgr. This allows
    the system to track and process bot-related data migrations, such as updating
    character stats, inventory, or behavior configurations when migrating from one
    version of playerbot functionality to another. The method does not perform the
    actual migration but prepares the system for it by storing the migration details.
    It is typically called during server initialization or when new migration scripts
    are loaded.
  parameters:
  - name: migration
    description: A constant reference to a MigrationInfo object containing the details
      of the migration to be registered, including version information, target components,
      and migration logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Migration Registration
    code: 'MigrationInfo myMigration;

      myMigration.version = "2.1.0";

      myMigration.description = "Update bot AI behavior for new quest logic";

      PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->RegisterMigration(myMigration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should be called before any migration processing
    begins. The registered migrations are typically processed in order of their registration
    time.
  warnings: Ensure that the MigrationInfo object passed to this method contains valid
    data; invalid or incomplete migration information may lead to unexpected behavior
    during migration execution.
