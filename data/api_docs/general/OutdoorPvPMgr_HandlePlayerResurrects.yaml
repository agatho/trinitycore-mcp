api:
  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: HandlePlayerResurrects
  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::HandlePlayerResurrects(Player * player, int areaflag)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player resurrects within outdoor PvP areas based on area flag.
  description: The HandlePlayerResurrects method processes player resurrection events
    that occur within outdoor PvP zones. It evaluates the specified area flag to determine
    if the resurrection should be handled by an OutdoorPvP system, and if so, executes
    the appropriate PvP-related logic for the player's resurrection. This includes
    managing respawn timers, updating PvP statistics, and ensuring proper faction-based
    resurrection mechanics are applied. The method is typically invoked during player
    death or resurrection events when the player is located in an outdoor PvP zone.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose resurrection is being handled.
      Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: areaflag
    description: Integer identifier representing the area flag of the player's current
      location. Used to determine which OutdoorPvP zone logic should be applied during
      resurrection processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player death handler
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... other death handling code ...\n\
      \    sOutdoorPvPMgr->HandlePlayerResurrects(this, GetAreaFlag());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom PvP zone logic
    code: "void OutdoorPvPMgr::HandlePlayerResurrects(Player* player, int areaflag)\n\
      {\n    if (OutdoorPvP* pvp = GetOutdoorPvPByAreaFlag(areaflag))\n    {\n   \
      \     pvp->HandlePlayerResurrect(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core outdoor PvP system and should only be called
    when a player is actually in an outdoor PvP zone. The areaflag parameter must
    accurately reflect the current player location to ensure correct PvP behavior.
    Performance-wise, this method does not perform heavy operations but may trigger
    additional event handling within OutdoorPvP systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior and likely crash. Ensure that the areaflag corresponds to an actual outdoor
    PvP zone to avoid incorrect processing of resurrection events.
