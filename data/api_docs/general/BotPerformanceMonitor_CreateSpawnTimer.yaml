  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: CreateSpawnTimer
  signature: ScopedTimer BotPerformanceMonitor::CreateSpawnTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a scoped timer for monitoring spawn creation performance.
  description: The CreateSpawnTimer method initializes and returns a ScopedTimer object
    that can be used to measure the duration of spawn creation operations within the
    BotPerformanceMonitor. This timer is typically used to track how long it takes
    to create or initialize bot spawns, which helps in identifying performance bottlenecks
    during bot behavior simulation or world object instantiation. The returned ScopedTimer
    automatically starts measuring time upon construction and will stop when it goes
    out of scope, making it ideal for RAII-based timing measurements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ScopedTimer instance that begins timing immediately upon creation and
    stops when destroyed. This timer can be used to measure the duration of spawn-related
    operations in the bot performance monitoring system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void SomeBotFunction() {\n    auto timer = BotPerformanceMonitor::CreateSpawnTimer();\n\
      \    // Perform spawn creation logic here\n    // Timer automatically stops\
      \ when 'timer' goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void SpawnBot() {\n        auto timer\
      \ = BotPerformanceMonitor::CreateSpawnTimer();\n        // Spawn logic here\n\
      \        // Time taken is automatically logged by the ScopedTimer\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ScopedTimer returned by this method follows RAII principles, meaning
    it will automatically start and stop timing without requiring explicit calls to
    start/stop methods. The timer's measurements are typically used for logging or
    profiling purposes within the TrinityCore bot subsystem.
