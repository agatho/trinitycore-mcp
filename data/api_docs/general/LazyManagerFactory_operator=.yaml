  brief: Moves ownership of a LazyManagerFactory instance to another instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the source
    LazyManagerFactory object to the target object, leaving the source in a valid
    but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer
    ownership of managed resources without unnecessary copying. In the context of
    TrinityCore's architecture, this method supports efficient resource management
    for lazy-loaded managers, which are commonly used for handling game systems that
    should only be initialized when first accessed. The move assignment ensures that
    manager instances can be transferred between containers or variables without duplicating
    expensive initialization operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target LazyManagerFactory object after the move operation
    has completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LazyManagerFactory factory1;

      LazyManagerFactory factory2 = std::move(factory1); // Moves factory1''s resources
      to factory2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'LazyManagerFactory factory1, factory2, factory3;

      factory1 = std::move(factory2) = std::move(factory3); // Chained move operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented as a move operation that transfers
    internal pointers or handles rather than copying data. After the move, the source
    object should not be used in a meaningful way unless re-assigned. The implementation
    assumes that LazyManagerFactory manages resources that can be safely moved, such
    as smart pointers or unique handles to game systems.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on an already moved-from object may
    result in undefined behavior if the object is subsequently used without proper
    re-initialization. Be cautious when using this operator in containers where elements
    might be moved during reallocation or other operations.
