  class: QuestCompletion
  method: OptimizeQuestCompletionOrder
  signature: void QuestCompletion::OptimizeQuestCompletionOrder(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the order in which quests are completed for a player bot.
  description: The OptimizeQuestCompletionOrder method reorders the active quests
    for a given player bot to maximize efficiency and logical flow. This typically
    involves prioritizing quests based on prerequisites, quest chain progression,
    and resource availability. The method ensures that the bot completes quests in
    an optimal sequence to minimize backtracking and maximize experience gain or objective
    fulfillment. It is commonly used in automated questing systems within TrinityCore-based
    emulators.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest completion
      order will be optimized. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeQuestCompletionOrder
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.OptimizeQuestCompletionOrder(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal quest state of the provided Player object.
    It assumes that all relevant quests are already added to the bot's quest log and
    that the player has sufficient resources (items, gold, etc.) to complete the quests
    in the optimized sequence.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player who is currently on a quest or in combat
    may lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that the bot is idle and not engaged in
    any active quest or combat before calling this function.
