api:
  class: BattlegroundScore
  method: GetDeaths
  signature: int BattlegroundScore::GetDeaths() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of deaths recorded for a player in a battleground.
  description: The GetDeaths method retrieves the total count of deaths associated
    with a specific player's score record within a battleground. This value is typically
    incremented each time the player dies during the course of the match. The method
    provides access to death statistics that are used for scoring, ranking, and post-match
    analysis in World of Warcraft's battleground systems. This information is crucial
    for determining final scores and player performance metrics in competitive battleground
    environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of deaths recorded for this
    player in the current battleground match. Returns zero if the player has not died
    yet, or if no death data has been recorded.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve player death count in battleground
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      int deaths = score->GetDeaths();

      printf("Player has died %d times in this battleground\n", deaths);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use death count for scoring logic
    code: "BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();\nint deaths\
      \ = score->GetDeaths();\nif (deaths > 5) {\n    // Apply penalty or special\
      \ handling\n    printf(\"Player has excessive deaths, applying penalty\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground scoring system and should only be
    called on valid BattlegroundScore objects that have been properly initialized.
    The death count is typically managed internally by the battleground system and
    may be updated automatically when player events occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlegroundScore object is valid before calling this
    method, as calling it on a null or uninitialized object will result in undefined
    behavior. This value should not be modified directly; use appropriate battleground
    APIs for updating death counts.
