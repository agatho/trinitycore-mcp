  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::~BotPerformanceAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotPerformanceAnalytics instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotPerformanceAnalytics class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of BotPerformanceAnalytics goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this may involve releasing performance
    tracking data structures or clearing internal buffers related to bot behavior
    analytics. The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime and should
    not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotPerformanceAnalytics object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\n    //\
      \ ... perform bot analytics operations ...\n    // Destructor automatically\
      \ called here when analytics goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring correct
    cleanup of derived classes if any exist. It's important to note that this destructor
    does not perform any explicit logging or reporting; its sole purpose is resource
    cleanup.
