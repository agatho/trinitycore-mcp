  signature: void WarlockAI::HandlePetSpecialAbilities()
documentation:
  brief: Manages and executes special abilities for the warlock's pet based on current
    combat state and AI logic.
  description: The HandlePetSpecialAbilities method is responsible for determining
    and executing special abilities or spells that a warlock's summoned pet can use
    during combat. This method evaluates the pet's current state, available mana,
    target conditions, and AI decision-making criteria to select and cast appropriate
    special abilities. It integrates with the broader WarlockAI system to ensure pets
    act intelligently and effectively in battle, aligning with the warlock's tactical
    approach and class-specific mechanics such as demonology, affliction, or destruction
    specializations. The method typically runs during each AI update cycle and may
    trigger pet abilities like Shadow Bolt, Suffering, or other specialization-specific
    spells depending on combat context.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandlePetSpecialAbilities();\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked within the WarlockAI's UpdateAI loop and
    relies on internal pet state tracking. It assumes that the pet has been properly
    initialized and is in a valid combat state. The actual spell casting behavior
    depends on the pet's AI settings and the warlock's specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet is not in an invalid or disabled state before calling
    this method, as it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the pet does not
    have proper AI configuration or available abilities.
