  class: ScopedProfiler
  method: SetCategory
  signature: void ScopedProfiler::SetCategory(HotspotCategory category)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the hotspot category for the scoped profiler instance.
  description: The SetCategory method assigns a HotspotCategory enumeration value
    to the ScopedProfiler instance, which is used to classify and group profiling
    data for performance monitoring. This categorization helps organize profiling
    results by functional areas or subsystems within the TrinityCore server. The method
    does not return any value and directly modifies the internal state of the profiler
    object. This functionality is typically used in conjunction with profiling systems
    that track performance metrics across different parts of the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: category
    description: The HotspotCategory enumeration value to assign to this profiler
      instance. Valid values are defined by the HotspotCategory enum, which likely
      includes categories such as AI, Movement, Network, Database, or Rendering.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScopedProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetCategory(HotspotCategory::AI);

      // Profiler now categorized as AI-related'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Category in Performance Monitoring Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player) {\n    ScopedProfiler profiler;\n\
      \    profiler.SetCategory(HotspotCategory::Movement);\n    // Movement logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ScopedProfiler class is designed for automatic timing and profiling of
    code blocks. Setting the category allows for better organization and filtering
    of profiling data in performance analysis tools. This method should be called
    before starting any profiling work to ensure proper categorization.
  warnings: Ensure that the HotspotCategory enum values are properly defined and consistent
    across the codebase. Incorrect category assignment may lead to misclassification
    of performance data during analysis.
