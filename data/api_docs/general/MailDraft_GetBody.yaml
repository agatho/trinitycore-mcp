  class: MailDraft
  method: GetBody
  signature: const std::string & MailDraft::GetBody() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the body text of the mail draft.
  description: The GetBody method returns a constant reference to the string containing
    the body text of the mail draft. This method allows access to the message content
    that will be sent as part of the email. The returned string is immutable, meaning
    modifications to it won't affect the internal state of the MailDraft object. In
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this is used when preparing in-game
    mail messages for delivery to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the body text of the mail
    draft. The string may be empty if no body has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Mail Body Text
    code: 'MailDraft draft("Subject", "This is the body of the mail.");

      const std::string& body = draft.GetBody();

      printf("Mail body: %s\n", body.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Mail Has Body Content
    code: "MailDraft draft(\"Subject\"); // No body set\nconst std::string& body =\
      \ draft.GetBody();\nif (body.empty()) {\n    printf(\"No body content in mail.\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Mail body: %s\\n\", body.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal storage within the MailDraft object,
    so it remains valid as long as the MailDraft instance exists. This method does
    not perform any copying of data, making it efficient for read-only access.
