  class: BugTicket
  method: BugTicket
  signature: void BugTicket::BugTicket(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bug ticket for the specified player.
  description: The BugTicket constructor initializes a new bug report ticket associated
    with a specific player. This method sets up the internal state of the bug ticket,
    including assigning the player who submitted the report and initializing default
    values for ticket properties such as status, creation time, and priority. The
    ticket is typically created when a player submits a bug report through the in-game
    interface or command system. This constructor ensures that all necessary data
    structures are properly allocated and initialized before the ticket can be processed
    by the bug tracking system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Bug Ticket for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already obtained

      BugTicket ticket(player);

      // The ticket is now initialized and ready to be processed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new bug report. It
    does not submit the ticket to any database or external system - that typically
    happens through separate methods like Submit(). The player reference must remain
    valid for the lifetime of the BugTicket object.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    bug reporting system. In most cases, bug tickets are created automatically when
    players use the /bug command or submit reports through the in-game interface.
