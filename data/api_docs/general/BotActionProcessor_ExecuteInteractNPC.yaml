  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteInteractNPC(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes an interaction with a non-player character (NPC) for
    a bot player.
  description: The ExecuteInteractNPC method handles the logic required to make a
    bot player interact with an NPC within the World of Warcraft environment. This
    typically involves initiating dialogue, triggering quest interactions, or performing
    other NPC-related actions. The method takes a bot player and a BotAction object
    that defines the specific interaction to be performed. It ensures proper state
    management and validation before executing the interaction, returning a BotActionResult
    that indicates success or failure of the operation. This method is part of the
    broader bot action processing system in TrinityCore, enabling automated NPC engagement
    for AI-controlled characters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the NPC. Must be a valid player instance and should be in a state where
      NPC interaction is allowed.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction object containing the details of the NPC
      interaction to be performed. This includes information about which NPC to interact
      with, what type of interaction (e.g., gossip, quest, vendor), and any associated
      parameters.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the NPC
    interaction attempt. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_ACTION,
    or other status codes depending on implementation details. The result helps determine
    if the interaction was processed correctly or if an error occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic NPC Interaction
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BotActionType::INTERACT_NPC;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = npcGuid;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteInteractNPC(botPlayer,\
      \ action);\nif (result == BotActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful\
      \ interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Interaction Result
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BotActionType::INTERACT_NPC;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = gossipNPCGuid;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteInteractNPC(botPlayer,\
      \ action);\nswitch (result) {\n    case BotActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        //\
      \ NPC interaction completed successfully\n        break;\n    case BotActionResult::FAILED:\n\
      \        // Interaction failed, possibly due to invalid state or target\n  \
      \      break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other cases\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player is already in a valid state and has
    proper access to the target NPC. The actual interaction logic may involve multiple
    steps including pathfinding, facing the NPC, and executing the appropriate game
    action sequence. Developers should ensure that the BotAction object passed contains
    all necessary information for the interaction to proceed correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player is not in combat or otherwise restricted from
    interacting with NPCs before calling this method. Passing an invalid or null pointer
    for 'bot' will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. The target NPC
    must be within interaction range and visible to the bot player.
