  brief: Marks a specific achievement as completed for the entire realm.
  description: The SetRealmCompleted method is used to mark a given achievement as
    being completed for the entire realm. This typically occurs when all players in
    the realm have earned the achievement, or when a realm-wide condition for the
    achievement has been met. The method updates internal tracking structures to reflect
    that this achievement is considered complete across all players on the server.
    It is generally used in conjunction with achievement progression systems and may
    trigger related events or notifications within the TrinityCore framework.

      if (entry)\n{\n    sAchievementGlobalMgr->SetRealmCompleted(entry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates database records and internal caches to reflect
    realm-wide completion. It may also broadcast notifications or trigger dependent
    achievements that rely on the completion of this achievement across the entire
    realm.
