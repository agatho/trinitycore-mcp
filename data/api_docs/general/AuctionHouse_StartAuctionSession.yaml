api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: StartAuctionSession
  signature: uint32 AuctionHouse::StartAuctionSession(int * player, AuctionActionType
    primaryAction)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a new auction house session for the specified player, returning
    a unique session identifier.
  description: The StartAuctionSession method initializes an auction house interaction
    session for a given player. It validates the player's eligibility and prepares
    the necessary context for auction-related operations such as browsing items, placing
    bids, or listing items for sale. The method returns a unique session ID that can
    be used to track and manage the player's auction activities within the current
    session. This function is typically invoked when a player opens the auction house
    interface or attempts to perform an auction-related action that requires session
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must be a valid, logged-in player or NULL to indicate no active player.
  - name: primaryAction
    description: Enumeration value indicating the primary auction action type. Valid
      values include browsing, placing bid, listing item, etc., as defined by AuctionActionType
      enum.
  returns: Returns a uint32 session identifier that uniquely identifies this auction
    house session for the specified player. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    failure to start the session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Start
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nAuctionActionType action = AUCTION_ACTION_BROWSE;\n\
      uint32 sessionId = auctionHouse->StartAuctionSession(&playerId, action);\nif\
      \ (sessionId != 0) {\n    // Session started successfully\n    printf(\"Auction\
      \ session started with ID: %u\\n\", sessionId);\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ start session\n    printf(\"Failed to start auction session\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Session Start with Error Handling
    code: "int* playerPtr = nullptr;\nAuctionActionType action = AUCTION_ACTION_LIST_ITEM;\n\
      uint32 sessionId = auctionHouse->StartAuctionSession(playerPtr, action);\nif\
      \ (sessionId == 0) {\n    // Handle invalid player or session error\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      auction\", \"Could not start auction session for invalid player\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"auction\", \"Session started successfully with ID: %u\"\
      , sessionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform internal validation checks on the player's state,
    such as ensuring they are logged in and have access to the auction house. Session
    IDs are typically managed internally by the AuctionHouse class and should not
    be manually generated or reused.
  warnings: Calling this method with a NULL player pointer will likely result in an
    invalid session ID being returned. Ensure that the player is properly authenticated
    before invoking this function. Incorrect usage of AuctionActionType may lead to
    undefined behavior or improper auction house functionality.
