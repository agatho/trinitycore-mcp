  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: IsMLPerformanceAcceptable
  signature: bool MLPerformanceTracker::IsMLPerformanceAcceptable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether machine learning performance metrics meet acceptable thresholds
    for gameplay stability.
  description: The IsMLPerformanceAcceptable method evaluates the current state of
    machine learning subsystem performance within the TrinityCore framework. It checks
    various performance indicators such as inference latency, model processing speed,
    and resource utilization against predefined thresholds to ensure that ML-driven
    features do not negatively impact game performance or player experience. This
    method is typically called during gameplay loops or performance monitoring routines
    to dynamically adjust ML feature activation based on system capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all measured machine learning performance metrics are within
    acceptable ranges, indicating that ML features can operate normally without degrading
    gameplay quality. Returns false if any metric exceeds the defined threshold, suggesting
    that ML features should be throttled or disabled to maintain optimal performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Check
    code: "if (mlTracker.IsMLPerformanceAcceptable()) {\n    // Enable advanced AI\
      \ features\n    player->EnableAdvancedAI();\n} else {\n    // Fall back to basic\
      \ AI behavior\n    player->UseBasicAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Performance Monitoring
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    static uint32 lastCheck = 0;\n    if (getMSTime()\
      \ - lastCheck > 5000) { // Check every 5 seconds\n        if (!mlTracker.IsMLPerformanceAcceptable())\
      \ {\n            sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING, \"ML performance\
      \ degraded, reducing AI complexity.\");\n        }\n        lastCheck = getMSTime();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations using tracked metrics from
    ML subsystems. The thresholds for acceptable performance may be configurable through
    server settings or dynamically adjusted based on system load. The implementation
    should be lightweight to avoid impacting the very systems it's monitoring.
  warnings: Do not assume that a 'true' return value guarantees optimal AI performance
    - only that it meets minimum requirements. The method may return false during
    brief spikes in system load, so consider implementing smoothing or cooldown periods
    before making significant gameplay changes based on its output.
