documentation:
  brief: Updates the dispel assignments for active dispels in the coordinator.
  description: The UpdateDispelAssignments method is responsible for managing and
    updating the current state of dispel assignments within the DispelCoordinator.
    This method typically iterates through all active dispels, evaluates their current
    status, and reassigns them as necessary to ensure proper handling of magical effects
    that are being removed from targets. It plays a critical role in maintaining synchronization
    between the game's dispel mechanics and the internal state tracking of the coordinator.
    The method is usually invoked during game ticks or when specific conditions require
    real-time updates to dispel assignments.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    _dispelCoordinator.UpdateDispelAssignments();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure dispel
    state consistency. It may involve locking mechanisms if thread safety is required,
    depending on how it's integrated into the broader system.
