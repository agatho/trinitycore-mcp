documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to activate or open a guild bank interface.
  description: The HandleGuildBankActivate method is responsible for handling incoming
    packets from players who wish to interact with their guild's bank. This function
    typically validates that the player has proper permissions and is within the correct
    context (such as being in a guild) before allowing access to the guild bank interface.
    It may also trigger UI updates or send relevant data back to the client to display
    the guild bank window. The method is part of the WorldSession class, which manages
    all communication between the server and connected clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildBankActivate(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildBankActivate&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Validate player is in guild and has permission\n    if (GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->HasMember(GetPlayer()))\n\
      \    {\n        // Send guild bank data to client\n        SendPacket(packet);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Guild Bank system and requires proper
    player state validation. It may be called multiple times during a session depending
    on how often a player opens/closes the guild bank UI.
