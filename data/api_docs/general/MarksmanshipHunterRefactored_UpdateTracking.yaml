  brief: Updates the tracking state of the marksmanship hunter's current target.
  description: The UpdateTracking method is responsible for managing and updating
    the state of a marksmanship hunter's target tracking system. This includes verifying
    if the current target is valid, checking if the hunter's focus has changed, and
    ensuring that the tracking mechanism remains synchronized with the hunter's current
    combat situation. The method typically gets invoked during combat updates or when
    the hunter's target changes to maintain accurate targeting information for abilities
    and auto-attacks.

      \ m_hunter->UpdateTracking();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core combat system during
    each update cycle. It's important to ensure that the hunter's target is valid
    before calling this method to avoid unnecessary processing or potential errors.
