  class: Creature
  method: GetRespawnDelay
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetRespawnDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn delay time in seconds for the creature.
  description: The GetRespawnDelay method retrieves the time interval in seconds that
    a creature will remain dead before respawning. This value is typically set by
    the game master or script during creature creation and determines how long the
    creature stays dead before reappearing in the world. The method is commonly used
    in creature AI scripts to determine respawn timing, especially for bosses or elite
    creatures where respawn behavior is critical for game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the respawn delay time in seconds as a uint32 value. This represents
    the number of seconds the creature will remain dead before respawning, with a
    value of 0 indicating immediate respawn.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 delay = creature->GetRespawnDelay();\nif (delay > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Creature will respawn after delay seconds\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Creature respawns\
      \ immediately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's internal state management and should
    be used carefully in AI scripts. The value returned may vary based on the creature's
    spawn parameters or script settings, and it's important to note that this delay
    is not necessarily tied to the actual respawn time but rather represents the time
    interval before the creature will respawn.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the delay in seconds, not milliseconds.
    Also, if the returned value is 0, it indicates immediate respawn which may be
    used for special cases like boss encounters or scripted respawns.
