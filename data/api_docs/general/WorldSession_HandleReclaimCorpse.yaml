documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to reclaim a corpse, restoring ownership and enabling
    loot collection.
  description: The HandleReclaimCorpse method processes a client packet requesting
    to reclaim a player's corpse. This action typically occurs when a player dies
    and wishes to retrieve their body for looting or resurrection purposes. The method
    validates that the player has the necessary permissions and that the corpse is
    eligible for reclaiming. It updates the corpse's ownership status, allowing the
    player or their group members to loot the remains. This functionality is integral
    to World of Warcraft's combat and death mechanics, ensuring proper corpse management
    within the game world.

  - title: Basic corpse reclaim handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleReclaimCorpse(WorldPackets::Misc::ReclaimCorpse&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate player is dead and has a corpse\n    if (!GetPlayer()->IsAlive()\
      \ && GetPlayer()->HasCorpse())\n    {\n        // Process the reclaim request\n\
      \        GetPlayer()->ReclaimCorpse();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the network packet handling system
    when a client sends a reclaim corpse request. The implementation relies on proper
    player state validation and group membership checks to determine eligibility for
    corpse reclaiming. It's important that this method is called only after verifying
    the player has died and their corpse exists in the game world.
  warnings: Improper handling of corpse reclamation can lead to exploits where players
    might loot corpses they don't own. Always validate that the requesting player
    is either the corpse owner or a group member before allowing reclaim operations.
    Failure to do so may result in unauthorized looting and potential account bans.
