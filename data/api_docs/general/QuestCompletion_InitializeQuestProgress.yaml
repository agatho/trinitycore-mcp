  class: QuestCompletion
  method: InitializeQuestProgress
  signature: void QuestCompletion::InitializeQuestProgress(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes quest progress for a player bot with the specified quest ID.
  description: The InitializeQuestProgress method sets up the initial state of a quest
    for a given player bot. This typically involves marking the quest as active, initializing
    quest objectives, and ensuring that the player's quest log reflects the new quest.
    The method is commonly used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots to
    prepare a player character for quest completion. It ensures that all necessary
    data structures are properly initialized before the bot begins engaging with the
    quest.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be performing
      the quest.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to initialize progress for. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::InitializeQuestProgress(bot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to interact with a quest's
    objectives or progress. It does not validate whether the quest is available to
    the player or if the player meets prerequisites; such checks are typically performed
    elsewhere in the code.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId corresponds to an existing quest in the
    database, otherwise behavior is undefined. Also, calling this method on a bot
    that is already engaged with another quest may cause conflicts or unexpected behavior.
