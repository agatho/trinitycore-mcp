  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleUseEquipmentSet
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleUseEquipmentSet(WorldPackets::EquipmentSet::UseEquipmentSet
    & useEquipmentSet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to use a saved equipment set for the player's
    character.
  description: The HandleUseEquipmentSet method handles incoming packets from the
    client that instruct the server to apply a previously saved equipment set to the
    player's character. This method is part of the WorldSession class and is responsible
    for validating the requested equipment set and updating the player's inventory
    accordingly. The method typically receives a packet containing the unique identifier
    of the equipment set to be applied, and it performs necessary checks such as set
    existence, player ownership, and equipment slot validity before applying the changes.
    This functionality allows players to quickly switch between different equipment
    configurations without manually equipping each item.
  parameters:
  - name: useEquipmentSet
    description: A packet object containing the identifier of the equipment set to
      be applied to the player's character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleUseEquipmentSet(WorldPackets::EquipmentSet::UseEquipmentSet&\
      \ useEquipmentSet)\n{\n    // Validate the equipment set ID\n    if (!sEquipmentSetMgr->IsEquipmentSetValid(useEquipmentSet.SetGuid))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Apply the equipment set to the player\n    _player->ApplyEquipmentSet(useEquipmentSet.SetGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the packet handling system in
    TrinityCore. The actual application of equipment sets may involve multiple steps
    including validation, inventory updates, and sending confirmation packets back
    to the client. The method assumes that the player has already been authenticated
    and that the equipment set exists in the database.
  warnings: Improper handling of equipment set IDs could lead to crashes or invalid
    equipment states. Always validate the provided GUID against existing equipment
    sets before attempting to apply them. This method should not be called directly
    without proper session context.
