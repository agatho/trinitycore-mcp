documentation:
  brief: Distributes loot among trading players according to specified rules
  description: The DistributeLoot method handles the distribution of items in a trade
    session, managing how loot is allocated between players based on the trade rules
    and item properties. It ensures that items are properly assigned to the correct
    traders and updates their inventories accordingly. This method typically operates
    within the context of a trading session where two or more players are exchanging
    items. The process involves checking item eligibility for trade, applying any
    necessary restrictions, and updating player states to reflect the completed trade.
  parameters:
  - name: items
    description: The number of items to be distributed in the trade session
  - name: useNeedGreed
    description: Flag indicating whether to use Need/Greed mechanics for item distribution
      when applicable
  returns: Returns true if the loot distribution was successful and all items were
    properly assigned to players, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Distribution
    code: "TradeManager tradeMgr;\nbool success = tradeMgr.DistributeLoot(5, false);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // All 5 items distributed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot Distribution with Need/Greed
    code: "TradeManager tradeMgr;\nbool success = tradeMgr.DistributeLoot(3, true);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Items distributed using Need/Greed mechanics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex inventory management and should be called
    only during active trading sessions. The implementation likely includes checks
    for item stack limits, trade restrictions, and player inventory space availability.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid trade session context may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all players involved in
    the trade are properly initialized before invoking this method.
