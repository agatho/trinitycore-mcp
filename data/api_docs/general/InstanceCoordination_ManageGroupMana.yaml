  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: ManageGroupMana
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ManageGroupMana(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Manages mana distribution and synchronization for group members within an
    instance.
  description: The ManageGroupMana method handles the coordination of mana resources
    among players in a group during instance encounters. It ensures that group members
    maintain appropriate mana levels, potentially redistributing or synchronizing
    mana based on encounter mechanics, class-specific abilities, or instance rules.
    This method is typically invoked during instance entry, combat events, or specific
    encounter phases to maintain balanced gameplay and prevent mana-related exploits.
    The implementation may consider player roles, class specializations, and group
    composition when managing mana distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose mana will
      be managed. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with active
      members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Entry
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterInstance(Player* player, uint32 instanceId)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->ManageGroupMana(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Management During Encounter
    code: "void OnEncounterStart(Boss* boss)\n{\n    if (boss->GetGroup())\n    {\n\
      \        sInstanceCoordination->ManageGroupMana(boss->GetGroup());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during instance encounters and should
    not perform heavy operations. It's designed to work with the TrinityCore's group
    management system and assumes that the group is properly initialized with valid
    members.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The
    method does not validate individual player states beyond basic group membership.
