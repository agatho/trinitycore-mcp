  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the SmartGameObjectAI to its initial state, clearing all active events
    and restoring default behavior.
  description: The Reset method is used to return a SmartGameObjectAI instance to
    its original state. This typically involves clearing any active event handlers,
    resetting internal timers, and ensuring that the AI responds to events as if it
    were freshly initialized. It's commonly called during object destruction, respawn,
    or when transitioning between different game states. The method ensures clean
    state management for smart GameObjects in TrinityCore's AI system, preventing
    leftover event triggers or inconsistent behavior after modifications.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void MyGameObject::OnRespawn()\n{\n    if (m_ai)\n        m_ai->Reset();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset in Event Handler Context
    code: "void GameObjectAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Reset AI state when\
      \ specific conditions are met\n    if (m_resetRequired)\n    {\n        Reset();\n\
      \        m_resetRequired = false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may interrupt ongoing event
    sequences. It's recommended to call Reset() before reinitializing or reconfiguring
    the AI behavior to avoid state conflicts.
