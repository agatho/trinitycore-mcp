documentation:
  brief: Returns the profession slot index for a given skill ID.
  description: This method retrieves the profession slot index associated with a specific
    skill ID for the player. It is used to determine which profession slot a particular
    skill belongs to, allowing for proper handling of profession-related data within
    the game mechanics. The method operates on the player's current profession information
    and returns -1 if no matching slot is found. This functionality is essential for
    managing player professions and their associated skills in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the index of the profession slot that contains the specified skill
    ID, or -1 if no such slot exists. The return value represents a zero-based index
    into the player's profession slots array.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int32 slotIndex = player->GetProfessionSlotFor(12345); // Returns slot index
      for skill ID 12345
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal player data structures and may involve lookup
    operations. Performance considerations are minimal as it typically involves simple
    array indexing.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a skill is a profession,
    as it only returns the slot index, not whether the skill is actually a profession.
    Be cautious when using this method with skills that might not be valid profession
    skills.
