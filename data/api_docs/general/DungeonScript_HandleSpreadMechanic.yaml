  class: DungeonScript
  method: HandleSpreadMechanic
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandleSpreadMechanic(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the spread mechanic to players and boss during dungeon encounters.
  description: The HandleSpreadMechanic method manages the application of the spread
    mechanic within dungeon scenarios, typically used in encounter scripting to control
    how players are positioned relative to a boss. This method likely adjusts player
    positions or applies effects that cause players to spread out from the boss to
    prevent overcrowding or ensure proper mechanics execution. It operates on integer
    pointers representing player and boss states or locations, modifying them according
    to encounter rules. The method is part of the DungeonScript class which handles
    general dungeon encounter logic and mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's state or position
      in the spread mechanic. This value may be modified by the method to reflect
      updated positioning or status.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's state or position during
      the spread mechanic. This value may be modified by the method to reflect updated
      positioning or status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart()\n{\n    int playerState = 0;\n\
      \    int bossState = 0;\n    HandleSpreadMechanic(&playerState, &bossState);\n\
      \    // Process updated states\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat logic
    code: "void DungeonScript::HandleSpreadMechanic(int* player, int* boss)\n{\n \
      \   if (*player > 0 && *boss > 0)\n    {\n        // Apply spread effect\n \
      \       *player = (*player + 1) % 4; // Example: cycle through spread positions\n\
      \        *boss = (*boss + 2) % 8;     // Example: adjust boss position\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other encounter management
    functions within the DungeonScript class. The integer parameters may represent
    specific state flags, positions, or indices related to the spread mechanic implementation.
    Developers should ensure proper synchronization when modifying these values if
    they are shared across threads.
  warnings: The method modifies values pointed to by its parameters, so callers must
    ensure these pointers are valid and properly initialized. Improper handling of
    pointer values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect encounter progression.
