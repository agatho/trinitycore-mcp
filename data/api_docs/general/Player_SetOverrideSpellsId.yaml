  class: Player
  method: SetOverrideSpellsId
  signature: void Player::SetOverrideSpellsId(int32 overrideSpellsId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the override spells ID for a player, allowing custom spell overrides
    in gameplay.
  description: This method assigns an override spells ID to a player, which determines
    the set of spells that will be overridden in the game's spell system. The override
    spells ID is used to control how spell actions are handled during gameplay, particularly
    when certain conditions are met. This method is typically used for custom spell
    sets or when implementing special game mechanics such as spell overrides or modifications.
    It affects the player's ability to use specific spells and can be used in conjunction
    with other methods that manage spell behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: overrideSpellsId
    description: The ID of the override spells set to assign to the player. This value
      determines which spells will be overridden during gameplay, typically representing
      a custom spell set or specific game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetOverrideSpellsId(12345);

      // This sets the override spells ID to 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetOverrideSpellsId(98765);

      // This sets the override spells ID to 98765, allowing for custom spell overrides

      // in a specific game context or scenario'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    and should be called carefully as it affects player behavior during gameplay.
    The override spells ID should be set before any spell-related actions are performed
    to ensure proper functionality.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell behavior or game
    mechanics issues. Ensure that the override spells ID is valid and corresponds
    to a known spell set in the game's database.
