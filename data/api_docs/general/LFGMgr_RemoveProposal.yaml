  method: RemoveProposal
  signature: void LFGMgr::RemoveProposal(int itProposal, LfgUpdateType type)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific LFG proposal from the system based on its index and update
    type.
  description: The RemoveProposal method is responsible for removing a specific Looking
    For Group (LFG) proposal from the internal tracking system. It takes an integer
    index representing the proposal to be removed and an LfgUpdateType enumeration
    that indicates the type of update associated with this removal. This method is
    typically used when a group formation attempt fails, a player leaves a proposal,
    or a proposal becomes invalid. The method ensures that the specified proposal
    is properly cleaned up from memory and any related data structures are updated
    accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: itProposal
    description: An integer index identifying the specific LFG proposal to be removed
      from the system. This index should correspond to a valid proposal in the internal
      LFG manager's proposal list.
  - name: type
    description: An LfgUpdateType enumeration value indicating the type of update
      associated with this removal. This helps determine how the system should handle
      cleanup and notification of other components about the proposal removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proposal Removal
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      lfgMgr->RemoveProposal(5, LFG_UPDATETYPE_PROPOSAL_FAILED);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Proposal with Different Update Type
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      LfgUpdateType updateType = LFG_UPDATETYPE_PROPOSAL_DECLINED;

      lfgMgr->RemoveProposal(12, updateType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system management and should only
    be called when a proposal needs to be removed from active tracking. The method
    assumes that the provided index is valid and corresponds to an existing proposal
    in the system's internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid proposal index may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the proposal exists before attempting removal,
    and verify that the LfgUpdateType parameter accurately reflects the reason for
    removal.
