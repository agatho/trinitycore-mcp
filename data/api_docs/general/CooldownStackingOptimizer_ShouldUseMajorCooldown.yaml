  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: ShouldUseMajorCooldown
  signature: bool CooldownStackingOptimizer::ShouldUseMajorCooldown(Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a major cooldown should be used on the specified target.
  description: The ShouldUseMajorCooldown method evaluates the current state of the
    unit and its target to decide if a major cooldown ability should be activated.
    This method is typically used in AI decision-making logic for class-specific abilities
    that have significant cooldown periods and provide substantial gameplay impact.
    It considers factors such as target health, available resources, combat situation,
    and cooldown status of the ability in question. The method does not directly execute
    the cooldown but rather provides a boolean recommendation for when it would be
    optimal to use it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the major cooldown should be used on the current target
    based on AI evaluation criteria; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (optimizer->ShouldUseMajorCooldown(target)) {\n    // Execute major\
      \ cooldown ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target, MAJOR_COOLDOWN_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat decision making
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    bool Update(Unit* target) {\n        if (cooldownOptimizer->ShouldUseMajorCooldown(target))\
      \ {\n            // Use major cooldown when optimal\n            return CastMajorCooldown(target);\n\
      \        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CooldownStackingOptimizer class which is designed
    to help AI agents make intelligent decisions about when to use abilities with
    long cooldowns. The implementation likely takes into account various factors including
    target threat level, unit health, mana levels, and other tactical considerations.
    This method should be called frequently during combat to ensure optimal timing
    of major abilities.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the cooldown is actually available
    or if the unit has sufficient resources to cast the spell. It only evaluates whether
    it's the right time to use a major cooldown based on situational awareness. Developers
    must ensure that proper checks are performed before actually casting the spell.
