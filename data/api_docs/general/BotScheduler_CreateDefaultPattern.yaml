  class: BotScheduler
  method: CreateDefaultPattern
  signature: ActivityPattern BotScheduler::CreateDefaultPattern() const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a default activity pattern for bot scheduling.
  description: The CreateDefaultPattern method generates a standard ActivityPattern
    object that defines the typical behavior and scheduling rules for a bot within
    the TrinityCore environment. This pattern usually includes predefined activities
    such as resting, moving, attacking, or looting with associated timing and conditions.
    The returned pattern serves as a baseline configuration that can be customized
    or extended by specific bot implementations. It ensures consistent default behavior
    across all bots while allowing flexibility for individual customization.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActivityPattern object representing the default scheduling configuration
    for bot activities, including activity types, timing constraints, and behavioral
    rules.
  examples:
  - title: Creating Default Pattern for Bot
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      ActivityPattern pattern = scheduler.CreateDefaultPattern();

      // Use pattern to configure bot behavior

      std::cout << "Default pattern created with " << pattern.GetActivities().size()
      << " activities" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when a new bot
    instance requires baseline scheduling rules. The returned ActivityPattern may
    be modified by subsequent calls to other methods in the BotScheduler class to
    customize behavior for specific scenarios.
