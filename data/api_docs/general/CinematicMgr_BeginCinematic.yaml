  signature: void CinematicMgr::BeginCinematic(const CinematicSequencesEntry * cinematic)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a cinematic sequence for the player using the specified cinematic
    entry.
  description: The BeginCinematic method starts playback of a cinematic sequence for
    the player character. It takes a CinematicSequencesEntry pointer which defines
    the cinematic to be played, including associated camera paths, audio, and visual
    effects. This method is typically invoked when a player enters a zone with a scripted
    cinematic or when triggering a specific quest-related cutscene. The cinematic
    will play immediately, potentially overriding any ongoing player actions such
    as movement or combat. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    control the cinematic's timing or progression; it simply initiates the sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: cinematic
    description: A pointer to a CinematicSequencesEntry structure that defines the
      cinematic sequence to be played. This entry contains data about camera movements,
      sound effects, and visual elements associated with the cinematic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic cinematic initiation
    code: "CinematicSequencesEntry* seq = sCinematicSequencesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (seq)\n{\n    sCinematicMgr->BeginCinematic(seq);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided CinematicSequencesEntry is valid and
    properly loaded in the game's data store. The actual cinematic sequence must be
    defined in the database or DBC files for this to work correctly.
  warnings: Calling BeginCinematic without checking if the CinematicSequencesEntry
    pointer is valid may result in a crash. Always verify that the entry exists before
    calling this method.
