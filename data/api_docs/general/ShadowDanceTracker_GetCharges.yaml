  class: ShadowDanceTracker
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 ShadowDanceTracker::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of charges available for the Shadow Dance ability.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the number of remaining charges that
    can be used for the Shadow Dance ability. This tracker is typically associated
    with a player's cooldown or resource management system, where charges are replenished
    over time or through specific game actions. The returned value represents how
    many more times the ability can be activated before it enters a cooldown state.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call during gameplay
    loops.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available charges for the Shadow
    Dance ability. A return value of 0 indicates no charges are currently available,
    while higher values indicate the count of usable charges.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 charges = player->GetShadowDanceTracker()->GetCharges();\nif (charges\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use Shadow Dance ability\n    player->UseShadowDanceAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Charges Before Casting
    code: "ShadowDanceTracker* tracker = player->GetShadowDanceTracker();\nuint32\
      \ charges = tracker->GetCharges();\nif (charges >= 2)\n{\n    // Cast Shadow\
      \ Dance with two charges\n    player->CastSpell(player, SHADOW_DANCE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}\nelse if (charges == 1)\n{\n    // Cast Shadow Dance with one charge\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(player, SHADOW_DANCE_SINGLE_CHARGE_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Shadow Dance tracker
    methods such as AddCharge(), RemoveCharge(), and IsOnCooldown(). The implementation
    assumes that the tracker object has been properly initialized and is valid. This
    method should not be called on a null pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the ShadowDanceTracker instance is valid before calling this
    method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in a crash. Also, note that
    charge values may change between calls if other systems are modifying them (e.g.,
    through spell effects or cooldown resets).
