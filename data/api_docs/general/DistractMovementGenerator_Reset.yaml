documentation:
  brief: Resets the distracted movement generator to its initial state.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the DistractMovementGenerator,
    clearing any existing state and preparing it for new movement behavior. This method
    is typically called when a creature's distraction state needs to be cleared or
    reset, such as when the creature returns to normal AI behavior after being distracted.
    The method ensures that the movement generator is in a clean state before being
    used again.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a DistractMovementGenerator
    code: 'DistractMovementGenerator* distractGen = new DistractMovementGenerator();

      distractGen->Reset(nullptr); // Reset the generator to initial state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the movement generator is not actively
    in use. Calling Reset while the generator is processing movement commands may
    lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent AI states.
