  class: InteractionManager
  method: StartInteraction
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::StartInteraction(Player * bot,
    WorldObject * target, InteractionType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an interaction between a bot player and a target object of a specified
    type.
  description: The StartInteraction method is used to begin a specific type of interaction
    between a bot player and a WorldObject target within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method handles the logic required to initiate interactions such as gossip,
    vendor transactions, quest acceptance, or other interactive events that involve
    the player character and game objects. It ensures proper state management and
    validation before starting the interaction process. The method returns an InteractionResult
    indicating whether the interaction was successfully initiated or if there were
    any issues during the start phase.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will initiate
      the interaction. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that serves as the target of the interaction.
      Can be an NPC, GameObject, or other interactive object.
  - name: type
    description: The InteractionType enum value specifying what kind of interaction
      should be started (e.g., GOSSIP, VENDOR, QUEST_ACCEPT).
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the outcome of attempting
    to start the interaction. Possible values include SUCCESS if the interaction was
    initiated correctly, FAILURE if there were validation errors or other issues,
    and potentially other status codes depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Start Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nWorldObject* target = ...;\
      \ // Assume valid target object\nInteractionResult result = interactionManager.StartInteraction(bot,\
      \ target, InteractionType::GOSSIP);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Interaction started successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vendor Interaction Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nWorldObject* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = interactionManager.StartInteraction(bot, vendor, InteractionType::VENDOR);\n\
      if (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Proceed with vendor interaction\
      \ logic\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player and target object are valid and within
    range. It may perform internal checks for distance, visibility, and object validity
    before proceeding. The actual interaction handling logic is typically deferred
    to other systems after this method returns successfully.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player and target objects are properly initialized
    and not null before calling this method. Calling with invalid parameters can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes in the game engine.
