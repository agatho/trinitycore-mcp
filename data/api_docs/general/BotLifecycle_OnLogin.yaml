documentation:
  brief: Initializes bot behavior and systems upon player login
  description: The OnLogin method is called when a bot player successfully logs into
    the game world. This method initializes all necessary subsystems, sets up the
    bot's state, and prepares it for gameplay operations. It handles essential setup
    tasks such as loading configuration data, establishing connections to the game
    server, and initializing AI behavior modules. The method ensures that the bot
    is fully functional and ready to perform its designated role within the game environment
    upon successful login.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in bot initialization
    code: "class MyBot : public BotLifecycle {\npublic:\n    void OnLogin() override\
      \ {\n        // Initialize bot systems\n        InitializeAI();\n        LoadConfiguration();\n\
      \        SetupBehavior();\n        // Bot is now ready for gameplay\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only once per bot session during the login process.
    It's typically invoked by the TrinityCore framework automatically after successful
    authentication. Developers should ensure that all initialization tasks are completed
    within this method to avoid runtime errors during gameplay.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy computational tasks or blocking operations in this
    method as it may delay the login process and affect other players. Avoid calling
    methods that require network access or database queries that could cause timeouts.
