  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: DespawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawnerOptimized::DespawnBot(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID from the game world.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a specific bot character from the game
    world using its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used in automated
    bot management systems within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The
    method performs cleanup operations such as removing the bot's AI behavior, clearing
    its inventory, and ensuring it no longer interacts with the game environment.
    It returns true if the bot was successfully despawned, or false if the bot does
    not exist or cannot be removed for any reason. This operation is generally irreversible
    without respawning the bot through other means.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to be despawned.
      This should be a valid 32-bit integer representing the bot's database entry
      ID.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully despawned from the game world,
    false if the bot does not exist or could not be removed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Despawn Usage
    code: "BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;\nbool result = spawner.DespawnBot(12345);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Bot successfully despawned\n    printf(\"Bot with GUID\
      \ 12345 has been despawned\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to despawn bot\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to despawn bot with GUID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Despawn Multiple Bots
    code: "BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;\nint botGuids[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor\
      \ (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n    if (spawner.DespawnBot(botGuids[i])) {\n  \
      \      printf(\"Successfully despawned bot %d\\n\", botGuids[i]);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Failed to despawn bot %d\\n\", botGuids[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot GUID provided is valid and corresponds to
    an existing bot in the database. The actual removal process may involve multiple
    internal steps including AI cleanup, database state updates, and client-side notification.
    Performance can be affected if large numbers of bots are despawned simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or silent failures. Always verify that the bot exists before
    attempting to despawn it. This operation should not be called on bots that are
    currently engaged in combat or performing critical actions, as it may leave the
    game state inconsistent.
