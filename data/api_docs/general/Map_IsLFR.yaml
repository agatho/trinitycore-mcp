documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map is a LFR (Looking for Raid) instance.
  description: The IsLFR() method checks if the current map instance is designated
    as a Looking for Raid (LFR) dungeon. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server implementation to identify special raid instances that are
    intended for random group matching. The method returns true if the map is an LFR
    instance, and false otherwise. This functionality is important for handling specific
    game mechanics such as loot distribution, experience rewards, and player progression
    within the LFR system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a LFR instance, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if current map is LFR
    code: "if (Map* map = player->GetMap()) {\n    if (map->IsLFR()) {\n        //\
      \ Handle LFR-specific logic\n        sLog->outString(\"Player is in an LFR instance\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal map flags or instance type information
    set during map creation. It's commonly used in conjunction with other instance
    checking methods to determine appropriate gameplay behavior for different dungeon
    types.
