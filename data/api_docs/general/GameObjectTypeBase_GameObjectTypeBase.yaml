  class: GameObjectTypeBase
  method: GameObjectTypeBase
  signature: void GameObjectTypeBase::GameObjectTypeBase(GameObject & owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GameObjectTypeBase instance with the provided GameObject owner.
  description: The GameObjectTypeBase constructor initializes the base class for game
    object types, associating it with a specific GameObject instance. This method
    sets up internal references and state necessary for the game object's behavior
    within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically called during the construction
    of derived GameObject classes to ensure proper initialization of the base type
    functionality. The owner parameter represents the GameObject instance that this
    type base will manage, establishing a relationship between the type definition
    and its concrete implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Reference to the GameObject instance that owns this GameObjectTypeBase.
      This parameter establishes the association between the type base and its concrete
      game object instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObjectTypeBase Initialization
    code: "class MyGameObject : public GameObject\n{\npublic:\n    MyGameObject()\
      \ : GameObject(), m_typeBase(*this) {}\nprivate:\n    GameObjectTypeBase m_typeBase;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore engine
    during GameObject instantiation. Developers should not call this constructor directly
    unless implementing custom GameObject types. The owner reference must be valid
    and fully constructed when passed to this constructor.
  warnings: Attempting to use an uninitialized or invalid GameObject reference may
    lead to undefined behavior. This constructor should only be called during proper
    object construction phases, not after the object is already in use.
