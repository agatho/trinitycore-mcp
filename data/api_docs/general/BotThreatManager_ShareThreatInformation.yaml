  method: ShareThreatInformation
  signature: void BotThreatManager::ShareThreatInformation(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Shares threat information among group members for bot AI behavior.
  description: The ShareThreatInformation method distributes current threat levels
    and target information between group members in a bot-controlled party. This functionality
    allows bots to coordinate their combat strategies by sharing knowledge about which
    enemies are targeting them or other group members. The method operates on the
    provided group member count parameter to determine how many entities should receive
    threat updates. It is typically invoked during combat situations where maintaining
    synchronized threat management is crucial for effective group play.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of group members
      whose threat information will be shared. This value determines how many bots
      or players will receive updated threat data during the sharing process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Sharing
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    int groupSize = GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    botThreatManager->ShareThreatInformation(groupSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Threat Sharing
    code: "void BotCombatHandler::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    if (IsInGroup())\n    {\n\
      \        int members = GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();\n        botThreatManager->ShareThreatInformation(members);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in bot AI systems to maintain synchronized
    threat management across group members. It should be called regularly during combat
    scenarios for optimal performance. The implementation likely involves internal
    data structures that track threat levels and target assignments.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect threat distribution. Ensure that the groupMembers parameter
    accurately reflects the current number of active group members before invoking
    this function.
