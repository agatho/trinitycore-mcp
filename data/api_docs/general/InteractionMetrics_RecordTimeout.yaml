documentation:
  brief: Records a timeout event in the interaction metrics tracking system.
  description: The RecordTimeout method logs a timeout occurrence within the interaction
    metrics framework. This method is typically invoked when an interaction between
    a player and an NPC, object, or game system exceeds its expected time limit. It
    updates internal counters and statistics to track performance and user experience
    metrics related to interaction delays. The method does not require any parameters
    and performs no return operations, making it a simple event logging mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Interaction Handler
    code: "void MyInteractionHandler::HandleTimeout()\n{\n    sInteractionMetrics->RecordTimeout();\n\
      \    // Additional timeout handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore framework to monitor
    and analyze interaction performance. It may be called from various subsystems
    such as quest systems, gossip interactions, or object usage handlers when timeouts
    occur. The implementation should be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments.
