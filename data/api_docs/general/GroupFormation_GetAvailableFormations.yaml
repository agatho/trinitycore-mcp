api:
  class: GroupFormation
  method: GetAvailableFormations
  signature: int GroupFormation::GetAvailableFormations()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available group formations for player units.
  description: The GetAvailableFormations method returns an integer representing the
    number of distinct formation types that are currently available for use by groups
    in World of Warcraft. This value is typically used to determine how many different
    tactical formations (such as circle, line, or wedge) can be selected when organizing
    group members for combat or movement. The returned count may vary based on player
    level, class abilities, and game expansion content. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of available formations. A
    return value of zero typically means no formations are currently accessible, while
    positive values represent the count of valid formation options. The exact meaning
    of each formation type is determined by internal game logic and client-side UI
    elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Available Formations
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nint count\
      \ = formation->GetAvailableFormations();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with formation selection logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Available formations:\
      \ %d\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal use within the TrinityCore
    framework and may be called during group management operations. It's important
    to note that the actual formation selection UI will typically filter these results
    further based on player class, talent specialization, and other contextual factors.
  warnings: Do not assume that all returned formation counts correspond directly to
    visible UI options; some formations might be restricted by player state or game
    rules. Also, calling this method outside of a valid group context may lead to
    undefined behavior.
