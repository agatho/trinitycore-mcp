  class: ArmsWarriorRefactored
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arms warrior's combat rotation based on the current target and
    game state.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat actions for an Arms Warrior class character. This method
    evaluates the current target, player's resource levels (such as rage), weapon
    conditions, and available abilities to decide the optimal sequence of attacks
    and spells. It integrates with the TrinityCore AI system to ensure proper execution
    of the warrior's rotation logic. The method typically gets called during combat
    updates and may trigger ability usage, positioning adjustments, or cooldown management
    based on encounter dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is essential for determining attack priority, threat generation,
      and ability targeting. Must not be null during normal operation.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyArmsWarriorAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        m_warrior->UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "void CustomArmsWarrior::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for rage availability\
      \ and execute appropriate rotation\n    if (GetPower(POWER_RAGE) >= 10)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Execute main rotation logic\n        DoMeleeAttack(target);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle low rage state\n        DoTaunt(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system at regular intervals during
    combat. It assumes that the target is valid and alive. The method may internally
    call other warrior-specific functions like CheckForCooldowns(), EvaluateTarget(),
    or ExecuteAbility(). Performance considerations include avoiding excessive calls
    outside of combat and ensuring target validity checks are efficient.
  warnings: Never call this method with a null target parameter as it will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target remains valid throughout
    the duration of the rotation update, especially when dealing with dynamic encounters
    where targets might change frequently.
