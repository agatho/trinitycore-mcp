documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a guardian pet.
  description: The IsGuardianPet method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a guardian pet, which is a specific type of pet that provides defensive or support
    abilities in World of Warcraft. Guardian pets are typically summoned by spells
    like Summon Guardian or similar mechanics and have distinct behavior patterns
    compared to regular pets. This method returns true if the minion is a guardian
    pet, false otherwise. The check considers the minion's type, summoning mechanism,
    and associated creature template flags to determine its classification.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is classified as a guardian pet; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a minion is a guardian pet
    code: "if (minion->IsGuardianPet()) {\n    // Handle guardian pet specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This minion is a guardian pet.\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle regular pet or other minion types\n    sLog->outString(\"This minion\
      \ is not a guardian pet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags and creature template data to determine
    if a minion qualifies as a guardian pet. It should be used in contexts where different
    behaviors are required for guardian pets versus regular pets or summons.
