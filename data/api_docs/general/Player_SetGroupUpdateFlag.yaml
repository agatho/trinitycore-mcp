  signature: void Player::SetGroupUpdateFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a group update flag for the player, indicating changes to group membership
    or properties.
  description: The SetGroupUpdateFlag method is used to mark a player's group data
    as needing an update. This typically occurs when there are changes to the player's
    group membership, such as joining or leaving a group, or when group properties
    like loot settings or leader status change. The flag signals to the game system
    that the player's group information should be synchronized with other players
    in the group. This method is part of the internal group management system and
    is usually called automatically by the core when group-related events occur, though
    it can also be invoked manually in specific scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The group update flag to set. This is a bitmask value that indicates
      what type of group data needs updating. Common values include GROUP_UPDATE_FULL,
      GROUP_UPDATE_PLAYER, GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG, and others related to group member status
      or group settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a group update flag for full group synchronization
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FULL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Manually triggering a group update after changing loot settings
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->GetGroup())\n{\n    player->SetGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework and
    should not usually be called directly by mods or addons unless implementing custom
    group behavior. The actual synchronization of group data happens asynchronously
    through the network system, where flagged updates are sent to group members.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context may result in undefined
    behavior. It's important to ensure that the player actually belongs to a group
    before setting update flags, especially when dealing with specific flag values.
