  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::UnregisterEventHandler(uint32 handlerId)
documentation:
  brief: Unregisters a previously registered bot lifecycle event handler by its unique
    identifier.
  description: The UnregisterEventHandler method removes a registered event handler
    from the BotLifecycleMgr, preventing it from receiving future lifecycle events.
    This method is typically used when a bot or module no longer needs to respond
    to specific lifecycle events such as creation, destruction, or state changes.
    The handlerId parameter must correspond to a valid, previously registered handler;
    otherwise, the operation may have no effect or could result in undefined behavior.
    Event handlers are usually registered using the RegisterEventHandler method and
    are managed internally by the BotLifecycleMgr singleton instance.
  parameters:
  - name: handlerId
    description: A unique identifier for the event handler to be unregistered. This
      ID is typically returned when registering the handler via RegisterEventHandler.
      Must be a positive integer representing a valid registered handler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 myHandlerId = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance()->RegisterEventHandler(&MyBotEventHandler);

      // ... some code ...

      BotLifecycleMgr::Instance()->UnregisterEventHandler(myHandlerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Unregistration with Validation
    code: "uint32 handlerId = GetRegisteredHandlerId();\nif (handlerId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    BotLifecycleMgr::Instance()->UnregisterEventHandler(handlerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It's recommended
    to unregister handlers before destroying the associated event handler object to
    prevent dangling pointers or access violations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid handlerId may lead to undefined behavior.
    Always ensure that the handlerId corresponds to a previously registered handler,
    and avoid calling this on already-unregistered handlers unless explicitly supported
    by implementation.
