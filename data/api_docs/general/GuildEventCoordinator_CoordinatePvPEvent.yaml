  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CoordinatePvPEvent
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinatePvPEvent(int * leader, uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a PvP event for a guild, using the provided leader and event
    ID.
  description: The CoordinatePvPEvent method is responsible for managing and organizing
    PvP events within the context of a guild. It takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the guild leader's identifier and a unique event ID to determine how the PvP event
    should be coordinated. This method likely handles event initialization, player
    registration, and resource allocation for the specified PvP activity. The method
    operates within the TrinityCore framework and integrates with the broader guild
    management and event systems. It is typically invoked when a guild leader initiates
    or schedules a PvP event.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild leader's identifier
      (GUID). This value is used to validate leadership permissions and associate
      the event with the correct guild.
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific PvP event
      to be coordinated. This ID determines the event type, rules, and associated
      data within the game system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PvP Event Coordination
    code: 'int guildLeaderGUID = 12345;

      uint32 eventId = 67890;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinatePvPEvent(&guildLeaderGUID, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal event queues and may perform validation
    checks on the leader's permissions before proceeding. It is expected to be thread-safe
    as part of the core game logic but should not be called from within critical sections
    without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided leader pointer points to a valid guild leader;
    otherwise, the method may fail or cause undefined behavior. The eventId must correspond
    to an existing PvP event type in the system to avoid runtime errors.
