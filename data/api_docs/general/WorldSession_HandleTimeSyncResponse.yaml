  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::HandleTimeSyncResponse(const WorldPackets::Misc::TimeSyncResponse
    & timeSyncResponse)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming time synchronization responses from the client to adjust
    server time tracking.
  description: The HandleTimeSyncResponse method is invoked when a client sends back
    a time synchronization response packet. This method updates internal time tracking
    mechanisms within the WorldSession to maintain accurate server-client time alignment.
    It plays a crucial role in synchronizing game time across distributed systems
    and ensuring consistent behavior for time-sensitive gameplay elements such as
    spell casting, cooldowns, and event timing. The method typically receives a TimeSyncResponse
    packet containing timing data that helps adjust the session's local time reference.
  parameters:
  - name: timeSyncResponse
    description: A const reference to the TimeSyncResponse packet received from the
      client containing timing synchronization data used to adjust internal time tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleTimeSyncResponse(const WorldPackets::Misc::TimeSyncResponse\
      \ & timeSyncResponse)\n{\n    // Update internal time tracking based on client's\
      \ response\n    _timeSyncCounter = timeSyncResponse.Counter;\n    _lastTimeSync\
      \ = getMSTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's network packet handling system and should
    only be called from within the session's packet processing loop. It's important
    to note that time synchronization is critical for maintaining game fairness and
    preventing timing-based exploits in multiplayer environments.
