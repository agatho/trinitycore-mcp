  class: Guild
  method: _SetRankBankMoneyPerDay
  signature: void Guild::_SetRankBankMoneyPerDay(GuildRankId rankId, uint32 moneyPerDay)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the daily bank money allowance for a specified guild rank.
  description: The _SetRankBankMoneyPerDay method configures the maximum amount of
    gold that can be withdrawn from the guild bank per day for a specific rank. This
    value is typically used in conjunction with guild bank permissions and controls
    how much money each rank level can access daily. The method updates internal guild
    data structures to reflect the new money allowance for the given rank. It is an
    internal method, likely called during guild initialization or when rank permissions
    are modified through the game interface.
  parameters:
  - name: rankId
    description: The identifier of the guild rank to modify. Valid values correspond
      to predefined guild rank IDs (e.g., 0 for Guild Master, 1 for Officer, etc.).
  - name: moneyPerDay
    description: The maximum amount of gold (in copper) that members of this rank
      can withdraw from the guild bank per day. A value of 0 disables daily withdrawals
      for this rank.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Officer Rank Bank Withdrawal Limit
    code: guild->_SetRankBankMoneyPerDay(GUILD_RANK_OFFICER, 1000000); // Allow officers
      to withdraw up to 100g per day
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bank Withdrawals for Regular Members
    code: guild->_SetRankBankMoneyPerDay(GUILD_RANK_MEMBER, 0); // Prevent regular
      members from withdrawing any money
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is internal and should not be called directly by external code.
    It's typically invoked by the guild system when rank permissions are updated or
    during initialization. The moneyPerDay value is stored in copper units (1g = 10000c).
  warnings: Modifying this value directly may bypass normal game permission checks.
    Ensure that changes align with intended guild management policies to prevent unintended
    financial access.
