  method: GetTransportHomePosition
  signature: const int & Creature::GetTransportHomePosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport home position coordinates of the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the transport home position coordinates for a
    creature, which represents the location where the creature was originally spawned
    on a transport. The method returns a const reference to an integer value that
    corresponds to the transport's home position coordinates. This is typically used
    in the context of creatures that are part of a transport system, such as those
    found on ships or other moving transports within World of Warcraft. The returned
    value can be used for positioning calculations and determining the creature's
    original spawn location relative to the transport.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to an integer representing the transport home
    position coordinates. This value typically corresponds to the X, Y, or Z coordinate
    depending on which axis is being referenced, and represents the original spawn
    location of the creature on its transport.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      const int& position = creature->GetTransportHomePosition();

      // Use position for calculations

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with transport-related mechanics
    and may be relevant when dealing with creatures that are part of a transport system.
    It's important to note that this method returns a reference to an integer, not
    a copy, which means the value should be handled carefully to avoid modification.
  warnings: The returned value represents coordinates on a transport, so care must
    be taken when using it in calculations or positioning. Incorrect usage may lead
    to positioning errors or unexpected behavior when dealing with creature movement
    on transports.
