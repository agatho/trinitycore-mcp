  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetTargetMask
  signature: uint32 SpellCastTargets::GetTargetMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the target mask indicating which targets are set for the spell cast.
  description: The GetTargetMask method retrieves a 32-bit bitmask that represents
    the valid targets specified in the SpellCastTargets object. Each bit in the mask
    corresponds to a specific target type or slot, allowing the system to quickly
    determine which targets have been defined for a spell. This is commonly used during
    spell execution to validate target presence and to determine the appropriate spell
    effects. The method does not modify any internal state and is typically called
    before processing spell effects or validating targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each bit represents a specific target type or slot.
    The exact bit mapping depends on the SpellCastTargetTypes enumeration, with bits
    set to 1 indicating that the corresponding target type has been specified in this
    SpellCastTargets object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... populate targets ...\nuint32 mask = targets.GetTargetMask();\n\
      if (mask & TARGET_FLAG_UNIT) {\n    // Target is a unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Targets
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... populate targets ...\nuint32 mask = targets.GetTargetMask();\n\
      if (mask & TARGET_FLAG_UNIT && mask & TARGET_FLAG_PLAYER) {\n    // Spell has\
      \ both unit and player targets\n}\nelse if (mask & TARGET_FLAG_DEST_LOCATION)\
      \ {\n    // Spell targets a location\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The target mask is typically constructed by setting individual bits when
    specific targets are added to the SpellCastTargets object. This bitmask approach
    allows for efficient checking of multiple target types without iterating through
    each target individually. The method returns immediately and does not perform
    any expensive operations.
