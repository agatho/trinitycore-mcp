  signature: void InstanceCoordination::UpdateGroupCoordination(Group * group, uint32
    diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination state for instance management and synchronization.
  description: The UpdateGroupCoordination method is responsible for managing and
    synchronizing group-related data within an instance context. This method handles
    the periodic updates required to maintain consistent group state information,
    such as member locations, instance entry permissions, and coordination flags.
    It processes group-specific events and ensures that all group members are properly
    synchronized with the instance's current state. The method is typically called
    by the game loop at regular intervals to keep group coordination data up-to-date.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that requires coordination updates. This
      parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group in the game world.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last update. This value is
      used to calculate time-based coordination logic and determine when synchronization
      actions should occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Coordination Update
    code: "void UpdateGroupCoordination(Group* group, uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!group)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Perform coordination updates for the group\n\
      \    // This would typically involve checking member positions,\n    // updating\
      \ instance entry permissions, and managing group state\n    \n    // Example\
      \ usage in game loop:\n    // UpdateGroupCoordination(playerGroup, deltaTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop. It's important
    to ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method. The diff
    parameter should accurately reflect the time elapsed since the last call to maintain
    proper synchronization timing.
  warnings: Passing a null group pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure
    that all group members are properly initialized and that the group exists in the
    game world before calling this method.
