documentation:
  brief: Initializes a StoredLootItem object with data from a LootItem structure.
  description: The StoredLootItem constructor initializes a new instance of the StoredLootItem
    class by copying data from an existing LootItem object. This method is typically
    used when creating stored representations of loot items that will be persisted
    or managed within the game's loot system. The initialization process ensures that
    all relevant properties such as item ID, stack count, and loot flags are properly
    transferred from the source LootItem to the new StoredLootItem instance. This
    constructor plays a critical role in maintaining consistency between temporary
    loot data and stored loot records in TrinityCore's database-backed loot management
    system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'LootItem lootItem;

      lootItem.itemid = 12345;

      lootItem.count = 2;

      StoredLootItem storedItem(lootItem);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Loot Processing Context
    code: "void ProcessLoot(Loot& loot, Player* player) {\n    for (auto& lootItem\
      \ : loot.items) {\n        StoredLootItem storedItem(lootItem);\n        //\
      \ Store or process the item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the LootItem data. The StoredLootItem
    class likely maintains references to database records or persistent storage, so
    proper initialization is crucial for maintaining data integrity. The method should
    be called during loot generation or when transferring temporary loot data to persistent
    storage.
  warnings: Ensure that the source LootItem object remains valid and unchanged after
    this constructor call, as the StoredLootItem may hold references to its data rather
    than making deep copies in some implementations.
