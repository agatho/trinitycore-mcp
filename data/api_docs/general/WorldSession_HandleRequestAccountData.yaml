    configuration packets and ensures that the player's account data is properly synchronized
    with the server. The method typically handles requests for various account settings,
    preferences, and saved data that should persist across sessions. It may trigger
    database queries or internal state updates to fulfill the request.

  - title: Basic usage in session handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestAccountData(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::RequestAccountData&\
      \ request)\n{\n    // Process account data request\n    SendAccountDataTimes(request.type);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the normal session packet handling
    flow when a client sends a request for account data. It's important to ensure
    that only authenticated sessions can access this functionality to prevent unauthorized
    data retrieval.
  warnings: Improper handling of account data requests could lead to security vulnerabilities
    or data inconsistencies. Always validate the request type and ensure proper authentication
    before processing.
