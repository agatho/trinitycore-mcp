  method: GetMaxMana
  signature: uint32 MageAI::GetMaxMana()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum mana value for the MageAI instance.
  description: The GetMaxMana method retrieves the maximum mana capacity for a mage
    AI character. This value represents the upper limit of mana points that the mage
    can possess at any given time, which is typically determined by the mage's level,
    equipment, buffs, and other game mechanics. The returned value is used internally
    by the AI system to make decisions about spell casting and resource management.
    This method does not modify any state and is purely a getter function for mana-related
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum mana points available to the mage
    AI instance. This value reflects the character's current mana capacity based on
    their level, gear, and buffs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 maxMana = mageAI->GetMaxMana();\nif (maxMana > 0)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ maxMana for mana management logic\n    uint32 currentMana = mageAI->GetCurrentMana();\n\
      \    float manaPercentage = (float)currentMana / maxMana * 100.0f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches the maximum mana value to avoid expensive recalculations
    during AI decision-making cycles. The value returned may change dynamically as
    the mage levels up or gains mana-boosting effects.
