  class: Loot
  method: AutoStoreTrackingQuests
  signature: void Loot::AutoStoreTrackingQuests(Player * player, NotNormalLootItemList
    & ffaItems)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically stores tracking quest items from a list of free-for-all loot
    items into the player's inventory.
  description: The AutoStoreTrackingQuests method processes a list of free-for-all
    (FFA) loot items and automatically adds any items that are associated with tracking
    quests to the specified player's inventory. This method is typically invoked during
    loot distribution to ensure quest-related items are properly handled. It checks
    each item in the provided FFA item list to determine if it has a tracking quest
    associated with it, and if so, stores it in the player's inventory according to
    standard loot rules. The method does not return any value but modifies the player's
    inventory directly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory will receive the tracking
      quest items. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active player.
  - name: ffaItems
    description: Reference to a NotNormalLootItemList containing the list of free-for-all
      loot items to be processed. These items are typically obtained from a creature's
      loot table during a kill or quest completion event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "void HandleCreatureLoot(Player* player, NotNormalLootItemList& ffaItems)\
      \ {\n    Loot::AutoStoreTrackingQuests(player, ffaItems);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot distribution system and should be called
    after all normal loot has been processed. It assumes that the player object is
    valid and that the FFA items list contains valid loot entries. The method does
    not perform any checks for inventory space or item restrictions beyond standard
    loot rules.
