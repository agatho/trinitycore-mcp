    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creature difficulty data for a specified difficulty level.
  description: The GetDifficulty method retrieves the CreatureDifficulty structure
    associated with a given difficulty level for this creature template. This method
    is used to access specific creature stats, loot, and other properties that vary
    based on game difficulty settings such as Normal, Heroic, or Mythic modes. The
    returned pointer points to internal data structures managed by the server and
    should not be modified directly. If no difficulty data exists for the requested
    level, the method returns a null pointer.
  parameters:
  - name: difficulty
    description: The difficulty level identifier (e.g., DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL,
      DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC) to retrieve creature data for.
  returns: A pointer to the CreatureDifficulty structure for the specified difficulty
    level, or nullptr if no such difficulty is defined for this creature template.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CreatureDifficulty* diff = creatureTemplate->GetDifficulty(DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL);\n\
      if (diff)\n{\n    // Use diff->Health, diff->Damage, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Difficulty Data
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_DIFFICULTY; ++i)\n{\n    const CreatureDifficulty*\
      \ diff = creatureTemplate->GetDifficulty(i);\n    if (diff)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Process difficulty-specific data\n        printf(\"Difficulty %d: Health=%u\\\
      n\", i, diff->Health);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal server structures and is typically used during
    creature creation or when determining appropriate stats for a specific difficulty.
    The returned pointer is valid only as long as the CreatureTemplate object exists
    and should not be cached across server ticks.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned CreatureDifficulty structure
    directly, as it's managed by the server and may cause inconsistencies. Always
    check for null return values before using the result.
