  class: CombatAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int CombatAI::Permissible(const Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the CombatAI class can be used for a specific creature.
  description: 'The Permissible method is used to evaluate if a given creature is
    suitable for using the CombatAI behavior. This method is part of the TrinityCore
    AI system and is typically called during AI initialization to determine if a creature''s
    type, faction, or other properties make it eligible for combat-based AI behavior.
    The return value indicates the level of permissiveness: a positive value means
    the AI is allowed, zero means it''s not permitted, and a negative value may indicate
    that another AI should be considered instead. This method helps ensure that only
    appropriate creatures use the CombatAI system, preventing conflicts with other
    AI behaviors.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the Creature object being evaluated for CombatAI suitability.
      This parameter represents the specific creature instance that the AI system
      is checking against its permissible conditions.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating permissiveness: positive values indicate
    the AI is allowed, zero means it''s not permitted, and negative values suggest
    another AI should be considered instead.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI selection
    code: "int CombatAI::Permissible(const Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (!creature)\n\
      \        return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n    \n    // Allow combat AI for hostile creatures\n\
      \    if (creature->IsHostileTo(PlayerOrPet::GetPlayerByUnit(creature)))\n  \
      \      return PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE;\n    \n    return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization and should be implemented
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. It's important to note that the return values
    are defined by the TrinityCore AI system constants such as PERMIT_BASE_NO, PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE,
    etc., which control how the AI system handles different creature types.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method can lead to creatures not receiving
    proper AI behavior or conflicting AI systems being applied. Developers should
    ensure that their logic properly evaluates creature properties and returns appropriate
    values according to the TrinityCore AI framework conventions.
