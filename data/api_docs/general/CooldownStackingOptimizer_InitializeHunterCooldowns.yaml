    framework. This method is responsible for establishing baseline cooldown states,
    registering applicable hunter abilities, and preparing internal data structures
    needed for cooldown management during combat scenarios. It ensures that hunter-specific
    cooldowns are properly initialized before any gameplay logic begins, allowing
    for accurate cooldown tracking and optimization calculations.
