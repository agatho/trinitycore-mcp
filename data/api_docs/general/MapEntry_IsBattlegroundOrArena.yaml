documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map is classified as a battleground or arena.
  description: The IsBattlegroundOrArena method checks if the current MapEntry represents
    a battleground or arena map. This is useful for determining special game mechanics
    and behaviors that apply specifically to these map types, such as PvP rules, scoring
    systems, and restricted actions. The method returns true if the map type is either
    BATTLEGROUND or ARENA, and false otherwise. This check is commonly used in game
    logic to enforce specific rules or modify behavior based on the map's nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a battleground or arena; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check map type
    code: "if (mapEntry->IsBattlegroundOrArena()) {\n    // Handle battleground/arena\
      \ specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a battleground or arena.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in PvP combat validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nMapEntry const* mapEntry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMapId());\n\
      if (mapEntry && mapEntry->IsBattlegroundOrArena()) {\n    // Allow PvP combat\
      \ in battlegrounds/arenas\n    player->SetPvP(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal map type classification stored in the
    MapEntry. It's important to note that this check is performed at runtime and may
    have performance implications if called frequently in tight loops. The implementation
    uses cached data from the game's map database.
  warnings: Be aware that some maps may be classified as battlegrounds or arenas even
    if they are not currently active. Always validate that the map is actually in
    use before applying gameplay logic specific to these map types.
