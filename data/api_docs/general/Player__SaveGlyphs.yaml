  brief: Saves the player's glyphs to the database
  description: This method saves the player's glyphs to the database, ensuring that
    glyph information is properly stored and persisted across server restarts. The
    method handles the saving process for all active glyphs in the player's glyph
    system, including any modifications made during the current session. It performs
    database operations to update or insert glyph data based on the player's current
    glyph configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveGlyphs(0);

      // Saves all glyphs to database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during player
    logout or when glyph changes occur. It may involve database transaction handling
    and should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly unless explicitly needed, as
    it's usually invoked automatically during normal gameplay operations. Improper
    use could lead to data inconsistencies.
