  class: LootStoreItem
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool LootStoreItem::IsValid(const LootStore & store, uint32 entry) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the loot item is correctly defined within the specified
    loot store.
  description: The IsValid method checks if a LootStoreItem is properly configured
    and consistent with the rules of the provided LootStore. It verifies that the
    item's entry ID exists in the store, that it has valid properties such as a non-zero
    chance to drop, and that it adheres to any internal consistency requirements defined
    by the loot system. This method is typically used during loot initialization or
    validation phases to ensure that all items in a loot template are correctly set
    up before being used in game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: store
    description: Reference to the LootStore object containing the loot definitions
      to validate against.
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the loot item to be validated within the store.
  returns: Returns true if the LootStoreItem is valid and properly defined in the
    given store; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "LootStoreItem item;\n// Assume item has been populated with data\nbool\
      \ isValid = item.IsValid(myLootStore, 12345);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with using the item in loot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in loot template processing
    code: "for (auto& item : lootTemplate.Items)\n{\n    if (!item.IsValid(lootStore,\
      \ item.entry))\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid loot item entry %u found\
      \ in template.\", item.entry);\n        continue;\n    }\n    // Process valid\
      \ items\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks that are essential for maintaining data integrity
    in the loot system. It is recommended to call this method before attempting to
    use a LootStoreItem in any gameplay context to prevent runtime errors or unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with uninitialized or invalid LootStoreItem
    objects, as it may lead to undefined behavior if internal state is corrupted.
    Always ensure that the LootStore reference passed is valid and properly initialized.
