documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the specified session informing them of changes to raid
    markers.
  description: The SendRaidMarkersChanged method is used to notify a specific WorldSession
    about modifications made to raid markers within the group. This typically occurs
    when a player places or removes a marker on the minimap or world map during a
    raid encounter. The method ensures that all members of the group who are currently
    in the same instance receive updated information about the marker positions, allowing
    them to synchronize their view and coordinate accordingly. It is an internal utility
    method primarily invoked by the Group class when marker state changes occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending raid markers changed notification
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SendRaidMarkersChanged(player->GetSession());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only sends the packet to a single session, not to all members
    of the group. It's typically used in conjunction with other methods that modify
    marker state. The method does not perform any validation on whether the session
    is actually part of the group or in the same instance.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the session belongs to the group
    may result in sending unnecessary packets or incorrect data to clients. Additionally,
    if called outside of a valid raid context, it might not behave as expected.
