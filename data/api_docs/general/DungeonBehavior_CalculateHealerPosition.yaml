  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CalculateHealerPosition
  signature: int DungeonBehavior::CalculateHealerPosition(const DungeonEncounter &
    encounter, const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal healer position within a dungeon encounter
    based on group composition.
  description: The CalculateHealerPosition method determines the most suitable location
    for a healer to stand during a dungeon encounter, taking into account the current
    encounter state and the number of group members. This calculation is crucial for
    maintaining optimal healing efficiency and positioning during boss fights. The
    method evaluates various factors such as player distribution, threat levels, and
    encounter mechanics to determine an ideal healer placement that maximizes survivability
    and damage output for the group.
  parameters:
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the current dungeon encounter object containing encounter-specific
      data and state information
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Integer representing the total number of players in the group participating
      in the dungeon encounter
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated healer position index,
    typically used to determine where the healer should be positioned relative to
    other group members or the boss. A return value of -1 indicates an error or invalid
    calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "DungeonEncounter currentEncounter;\nint groupSize = 5;\nint healerPosition\
      \ = dungeonBehavior.CalculateHealerPosition(currentEncounter, groupSize);\n\
      if (healerPosition >= 0) {\n    // Use healerPosition to determine where to\
      \ place the healer\n    printf(\"Healer should be positioned at index: %d\\\
      n\", healerPosition);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to calculate healer position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "class DungeonManager {\npublic:\n    void SetupHealerPosition(DungeonBehavior&\
      \ behavior, const DungeonEncounter& encounter, int groupSize) {\n        int\
      \ position = behavior.CalculateHealerPosition(encounter, groupSize);\n     \
      \   if (position >= 0 && position < MAX_GROUP_SIZE) {\n            // Set healer\
      \ at calculated position\n            groupMembers[position].SetRole(ROLE_HEALER);\n\
      \            printf(\"Healer positioned at slot %d\\n\", position);\n      \
      \  } else {\n            // Fallback to default positioning\n            groupMembers[0].SetRole(ROLE_HEALER);\n\
      \            printf(\"Using default healer position\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter initialization or
    when group composition changes. The calculation may vary based on encounter-specific
    mechanics and player roles. Performance-wise, this method should execute quickly
    as it's called frequently during encounters. The method assumes valid input parameters
    and does not perform extensive validation.
  warnings: The method may return -1 if the encounter data is invalid or if group
    size exceeds expected limits. Developers should always check for negative return
    values before using the calculated position. This method might need to be called
    multiple times during an encounter as group dynamics change.
