  class: FormationManager
  method: FormationManager
  signature: void FormationManager::FormationManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FormationManager instance for the specified bot player, setting
    up formation-related data structures and state tracking.
  description: The FormationManager constructor initializes internal data structures
    and state variables required for managing player formations within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up tracking for the bot's current formation position,
    leader reference, and formation behavior settings. It prepares the manager to
    handle formation-related commands such as following a leader, maintaining formation
    distance, or executing formation-based AI behaviors. The initialization process
    ensures that subsequent calls to formation management methods will operate correctly
    with valid internal state. This constructor is typically invoked during bot creation
    or when a bot joins a specific formation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this FormationManager
      instance will manage. Must not be null and must represent a valid player entity
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic FormationManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      FormationManager* formationMgr = new FormationManager(myBot);

      // The formation manager is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: FormationManager in Bot Creation Context
    code: "class BotAI : public PlayerAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeBot() {\n\
      \        // ... other initialization code ...\n        formationManager = new\
      \ FormationManager(bot);\n        // ... continue with AI setup ...\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs minimal initialization and does not immediately
    activate any formation behavior. Formation activation typically requires additional
    method calls such as SetFormationLeader() or JoinFormation(). The FormationManager
    assumes that the provided Player pointer is valid and properly initialized within
    the game world context.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter refers to a valid, active player
    object before calling this constructor. Avoid calling this constructor multiple
    times on the same FormationManager instance without proper cleanup.
