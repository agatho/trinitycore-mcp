  brief: Moves an AchievementGlobalMgr object to another AchievementGlobalMgr object
    using move semantics.
  description: The AchievementGlobalMgr move constructor initializes a new AchievementGlobalMgr
    instance by transferring ownership of resources from an existing AchievementGlobalMgr
    rvalue reference. This constructor is part of the standard C++ move semantics
    implementation and allows for efficient resource transfer without deep copying.
    In the context of TrinityCore's achievement system, this method facilitates the
    creation of new global achievement managers by taking over the internal state
    of an existing one, which is commonly used during object construction or reassignment
    scenarios. The operation typically occurs when an AchievementGlobalMgr object
    is being moved rather than copied, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary
    data duplication.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'AchievementGlobalMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... initialize sourceMgr ...

      AchievementGlobalMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Parameter Move Example
    code: "void ProcessAchievementManager(AchievementGlobalMgr&& mgr) {\n    // Use\
      \ the moved manager\n    // mgr now owns the resources previously owned by the\
      \ caller\n}\n\n// Usage:\nAchievementGlobalMgr myMgr;\nProcessAchievementManager(std::move(myMgr));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no user-defined
    move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all data members. The
    source object should not be used after this operation as its resources have been
    transferred. In TrinityCore's context, this move constructor ensures efficient
    handling of global achievement manager objects during system initialization or
    state transitions.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the original object is left in a
    valid but unspecified state. Any attempt to use the moved-from object may result
    in undefined behavior unless explicitly documented otherwise. Ensure that no code
    attempts to access members of the source object after it has been moved from.
