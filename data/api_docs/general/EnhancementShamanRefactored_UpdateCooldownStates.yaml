documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all enhancement shaman abilities and talents.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with all abilities, spells, and talents available
    to an Enhancement Shaman character. This method ensures that the player's cooldowns
    are properly tracked and displayed in the user interface, preventing the use of
    abilities before their cooldown periods have expired. It typically iterates through
    the shaman's spellbook or ability list, checking each ability's current cooldown
    status and updating internal timers accordingly. The method is commonly invoked
    during combat events, after casting spells, or at regular intervals to maintain
    accurate cooldown state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    m_shaman->UpdateCooldownStates();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat flow ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown State Update After Spell Cast
    code: "void OnSpellCast(SpellInfo* spell)\n{\n    // Execute spell logic\n   \
      \ CastSpell(spell);\n    \n    // Update cooldown states for all abilities\n\
      \    m_shaman->UpdateCooldownStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during game state updates. Developers should not need to manually invoke this
    method unless implementing custom behavior. The method may have performance implications
    if called excessively during high-frequency events.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause unnecessary performance overhead.
    It's recommended to only call it when cooldown states actually change or at defined
    intervals rather than on every game tick.
