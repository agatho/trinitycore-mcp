  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetActiveObjectives
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::GetActiveObjectives(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active objectives assigned to a player character.
  description: The GetActiveObjectives method returns the number of currently active
    objectives associated with the specified player. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method is typically used within quest tracking
    systems to determine how many ongoing quests or objectives are available for a
    given player. The method does not modify any state and simply provides a read-only
    count of active objectives, which can be useful for UI updates, quest status checks,
    or automation scripts. This function assumes that the player object passed to
    it is valid and properly initialized within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of active objectives currently
    assigned to the specified player. Returns zero if no objectives are active or
    if the player is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint activeCount\
      \ = objectiveTracker->GetActiveObjectives(bot);\nif (activeCount > 0)\n{\n \
      \   printf(\"Player has %d active objectives\\n\", activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectiveTracker system which manages quest and
    objective states for players. It's commonly used in AI scripts or quest automation
    systems where knowing the number of active objectives helps determine next steps
    in quest progression.
