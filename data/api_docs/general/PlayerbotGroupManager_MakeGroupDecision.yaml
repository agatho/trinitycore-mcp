  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: MakeGroupDecision
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::MakeGroupDecision(uint32 groupId, const std::string
    & decision)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a group decision for the specified group ID using the provided
    decision string.
  description: The MakeGroupDecision method handles the logic for processing decisions
    within a player bot group. It takes a group identifier and a decision string to
    determine how the group should act or respond. This method is typically used in
    player bot AI systems where group coordination is required. The decision string
    may contain commands, actions, or strategies that the group members should execute.
    The method likely triggers internal group management functions to apply the decision
    across all relevant group members.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player bot group for which the decision
      is being made. Must be a valid group ID that exists in the current player bot
      system.
  - name: decision
    description: String representation of the decision to be processed by the group.
      Contains commands or strategies that define how the group should act, such as
      'attack', 'flee', or 'follow'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Decision
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->MakeGroupDecision(12345, "attack");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Flee Decision
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->MakeGroupDecision(67890, "flee");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot AI system and assumes that the group
    manager has been properly initialized. The decision string should be validated
    before calling to ensure it matches expected command formats. This method may
    trigger asynchronous operations depending on how the internal group AI is implemented.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may result in undefined behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active player bot group before
    invoking this function. The decision string must be properly formatted to avoid
    misinterpretation by the group AI logic.
