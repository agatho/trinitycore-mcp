  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const InterruptStatistics & InterruptRotationManager::GetStatistics()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt statistics for the rotation manager.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the InterruptStatistics
    object that holds detailed information about interrupt-related events and performance
    metrics within the rotation manager. This includes data such as total interrupts,
    successful interrupts, failed interrupts, and timing information. The returned
    statistics object is immutable, ensuring that external code cannot modify internal
    state through this interface. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging,
    or reporting purposes to understand how often and effectively interrupts are being
    handled during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an InterruptStatistics object containing interrupt-related
    performance metrics and event counts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Interrupt Statistics
    code: 'const InterruptStatistics& stats = rotationManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalInterrupts = stats.total_interrupts;

      uint32 successfulInterrupts = stats.successful_interrupts;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Interrupt Statistics for Debugging
    code: "const InterruptStatistics& stats = rotationManager.GetStatistics();\nTC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Total Interrupts: %u, Successful: %u, Failed: %u\",\n    stats.total_interrupts,\n\
      \    stats.successful_interrupts,\n    stats.failed_interrupts);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned InterruptStatistics object is valid only until the next call
    to GetStatistics or until the rotation manager instance is destroyed. The statistics
    are updated incrementally as interrupt events occur during gameplay, making this
    method suitable for real-time monitoring.
