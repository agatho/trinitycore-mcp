  class: ScopedPatternRecording
  method: RecordPosition
  signature: void ScopedPatternRecording::RecordPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Records the current position of the player or object within a scoped pattern
    recording context.
  description: The RecordPosition method captures and stores the current location
    of an entity, typically used in conjunction with pattern-based movement or pathfinding
    systems. This method is commonly employed in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to log waypoints or positions during scripted events, creature behavior, or player
    movement tracking. It allows for precise positioning data capture that can be
    later retrieved or used for navigation purposes. The recording mechanism usually
    operates within a scoped context, ensuring that position data is properly managed
    and associated with the correct pattern or sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Recording
    code: 'ScopedPatternRecording recording;

      recording.RecordPosition(); // Records current position of the entity'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Creature AI Context
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (me->IsInCombat())\n        {\n        \
      \    patternRecorder.RecordPosition(); // Record position during combat\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within a scoped context where position recording
    is managed automatically. The actual storage mechanism depends on the implementation
    of ScopedPatternRecording, which may use internal buffers or linked lists to maintain
    ordered position data. Performance considerations are minimal for single calls
    but may accumulate if called frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the entity being recorded has a valid position before calling
    this method. Calling RecordPosition without proper initialization or context may
    result in undefined behavior or invalid position data. This method should not
    be used outside of appropriate AI or movement contexts.
