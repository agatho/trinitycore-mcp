    for performance impact during high-traffic periods. It's generally intended to
    be invoked by the game's internal systems rather than directly by external code.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance degradation due
    to database queries and data processing. Avoid invoking it in tight loops or from
    time-critical code paths.
