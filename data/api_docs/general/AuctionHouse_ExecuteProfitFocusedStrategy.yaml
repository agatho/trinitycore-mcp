  class: AuctionHouse

  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteProfitFocusedStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a profit-focused auction house strategy for the given player session.
  description: The ExecuteProfitFocusedStrategy method implements a strategic approach
    to managing auctions within the auction house system, prioritizing transactions
    that yield maximum profit for the player. This method analyzes current market
    conditions, item values, and bidding behaviors to determine optimal auction listings
    or purchases. It is typically invoked during automated auction management processes
    or when a player's auction behavior is configured to focus on profitability rather
    than other factors such as speed or volume. The method operates within the context
    of an AuctionSession, which holds session-specific data and state information.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's auction behavior is being processed
      by the strategy.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object that contains session-specific
      data, including current auctions, bidding history, and market analysis for the
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Auction Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with relevant auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteProfitFocusedStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Automated Auction Bot
    code: "void ProcessPlayerAuctions(Player* player) {\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    AuctionSession session;\n    // Populate session with current auction data\n\
      \    auctionHouse->ExecuteProfitFocusedStrategy(&playerId, session);\n    //\
      \ Apply profit-focused actions based on strategy results\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided player ID and session data are valid
    and up-to-date. It may perform internal calculations involving item pricing, market
    trends, and bidding patterns to determine optimal strategies. The method is designed
    to be non-blocking and should not interfere with other auction house operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method; passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    Additionally, session data must accurately reflect current auction conditions
    for effective strategy execution.
