  class: DifficultyCurve
  method: AddDataPoint
  signature: void DifficultyCurve::AddDataPoint(float playerSkill, float optimalDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a data point to the difficulty curve for skill-based difficulty adjustment.
  description: The AddDataPoint method is used to insert a new skill versus optimal
    difficulty mapping into the DifficultyCurve class. This curve is typically utilized
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to dynamically adjust quest, dungeon, or encounter
    difficulties based on player skill levels. Each data point consists of a player
    skill value and its corresponding optimal difficulty level, which helps define
    how difficulty scales with player capability. The method likely stores these points
    internally for later interpolation or lookup during gameplay calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: playerSkill
    description: A float representing the player's skill level or capability. This
      value typically ranges from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest), though exact bounds
      may vary based on implementation.
  - name: optimalDifficulty
    description: A float representing the optimal difficulty level that corresponds
      to the given player skill. This value defines what difficulty level would be
      ideal for a player with the specified skill.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      curve.AddDataPoint(0.5f, 10.0f);

      curve.AddDataPoint(0.8f, 20.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Populating Difficulty Curve for Quests
    code: "void SetupQuestDifficultyCurve(DifficultyCurve& curve)\n{\n    curve.AddDataPoint(0.0f,\
      \ 1.0f);   // Novice players get easy quests\n    curve.AddDataPoint(0.3f, 5.0f);\
      \   // Intermediate players get medium quests\n    curve.AddDataPoint(0.7f,\
      \ 15.0f);  // Advanced players get hard quests\n    curve.AddDataPoint(1.0f,\
      \ 25.0f);  // Expert players get very hard quests\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely stores data points in a sorted container to enable efficient
    interpolation or lookup when determining difficulty adjustments. It is important
    that playerSkill values are added in ascending order for optimal performance,
    though the implementation may handle re-sorting internally.
  warnings: Adding data points out of order might affect internal sorting and performance
    if the curve uses an ordered structure. Ensure that all data points are valid
    floats and within expected ranges to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes during
    difficulty calculations.
