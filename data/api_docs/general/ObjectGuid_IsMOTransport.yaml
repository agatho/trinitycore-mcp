documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a MOTransport object.
  description: The IsMOTransport() method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance
    corresponds to a MOTransport object type. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    MOTransport refers to a specific category of game objects that are used for transporting
    players or entities across maps, such as boats, zeppelins, or other vehicle-based
    transport mechanisms. This method evaluates the object type stored within the
    GUID and returns true if it matches the MOTransport type identifier, otherwise
    false. The check is performed using internal bit manipulation and type flags embedded
    within the ObjectGuid structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents an MOTransport object; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a GUID is an MOTransport
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::MOTransport>(0, 12345);\n\
      if (guid.IsMOTransport()) {\n    // Handle MOTransport-specific logic\n    printf(\"\
      GUID represents an MOTransport\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid where the high
    bits encode the object type. It is a fast operation that performs a simple bitwise
    comparison and does not involve any database or network calls.
