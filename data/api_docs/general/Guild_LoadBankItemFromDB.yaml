  method: LoadBankItemFromDB
  signature: bool Guild::LoadBankItemFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a guild bank item from the database into the guild's internal data
    structures.
  description: The LoadBankItemFromDB method is responsible for retrieving and initializing
    a single guild bank item entry from the database. This method is typically called
    during the guild initialization process or when loading guild data from the database.
    It processes the database fields to construct a guild bank item object, which
    is then stored in the guild's internal collection of bank items. The method ensures
    that all relevant item properties such as item GUID, slot position, and stack
    count are correctly loaded and validated before being added to the guild's bank
    inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: fields
    description: Pointer to an array of database field values representing a single
      guild bank item record. The fields typically include item GUID, slot position,
      stack count, and other relevant metadata required to reconstruct the bank item.
  returns: Returns true if the bank item was successfully loaded and processed from
    the database; returns false if there was an error during loading or validation
    of the database record.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Initialization
    code: "void Guild::LoadBankItems()\n{\n    QueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"\
      SELECT itemguid, slot, item_entry, stackcount FROM guild_bank_item WHERE guildid\
      \ = {}\", GetId());\n    if (!result)\n        return;\n\n    do\n    {\n  \
      \      int fields[4];\n        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n            fields[i]\
      \ = result->Fetch()[i].Get<int>();\n\n        LoadBankItemFromDB(fields);\n\
      \    } while (result->NextRow());\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the internal guild data loading mechanism and should
    not be called directly by external code. It assumes that the database fields are
    properly formatted and that the guild object has been initialized with valid data
    before calling.
  warnings: Improper handling of the fields array can lead to memory corruption or
    invalid data being loaded into the guild's bank inventory. Ensure that the fields
    parameter points to a properly initialized array with sufficient elements for
    all expected database columns.
