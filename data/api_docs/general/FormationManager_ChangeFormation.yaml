documentation:
  brief: Changes the formation type of the FormationManager instance.
  description: The ChangeFormation method updates the current formation type managed
    by the FormationManager. This method is typically used in AI and group management
    systems within TrinityCore to adjust how units move or position themselves in
    formations such as line, circle, or wedge. The method returns true if the formation
    change was successful, and false otherwise. It may fail if the new formation type
    is invalid or if the manager's internal state prevents the transition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the formation type was successfully changed; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Change
    code: "FormationManager* fm = ...;\nbool success = fm->ChangeFormation(FormationType::LINE);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Formation changed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state tracking of units and their
    positioning. It may trigger updates to unit movement paths or AI behaviors depending
    on the formation type.
