documentation:
  brief: Manages the application and removal of augmentation buffs for the evoker
    AI.
  description: The ManageAugmentationBuffs method is responsible for handling the
    logic that determines when to apply or remove augmentation buffs specific to the
    evoker class in the TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates the current state
    of the evoker, including its health, mana, and combat situation, to decide whether
    to activate or deactivate relevant augmentation effects. It ensures that the evoker
    AI maintains optimal buff states during gameplay, aligning with the class's abilities
    and spell mechanics. The method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making
    loop and may interact with other buff management systems within the EvokerAI class.

    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n   \
      \ ManageAugmentationBuffs();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the AI update cycle and may perform checks
    on the evoker's current status, such as health percentage or mana levels. It might
    rely on internal flags or timers to determine when buffs should be applied or
    removed.
