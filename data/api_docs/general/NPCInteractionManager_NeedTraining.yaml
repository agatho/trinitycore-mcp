  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::NeedTraining() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the NPC requires training for the player's class.
  description: The NeedTraining method evaluates if the current NPC is a trainer that
    offers skills or spells specific to the player's class. This check is essential
    for determining if the NPC should display training-related options in the interaction
    menu. The method typically examines the NPC's flags, faction, and creature template
    data to determine if it qualifies as a trainable NPC. It does not perform any
    complex logic but rather acts as a quick boolean indicator based on predefined
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the NPC is a trainer for the player's class; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if NPC needs training before initiating dialogue
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->NeedTraining()) {\n    player->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM(GOSSIP_ICON_TRAINER,\
      \ \"Train me\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n} else {\n    player->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM(GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT,\
      \ \"I need no training.\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying creature data and faction settings to
    make its determination. It is commonly used in conjunction with gossip systems
    to conditionally show training options.
