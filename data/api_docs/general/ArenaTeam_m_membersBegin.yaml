  class: ArenaTeam
  method: m_membersBegin
  signature: int ArenaTeam::m_membersBegin()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the starting index of the arena team members list.
  description: The m_membersBegin method provides the initial position in the internal
    container that stores arena team member data. This value is typically used as
    a starting point for iterating through the list of players belonging to an arena
    team. The returned integer represents the zero-based index where the first member
    of the team is located within the underlying data structure. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with m_membersEnd() or other iterator functions to traverse
    the members collection. It's important to note that this value may change if members
    are added or removed from the team.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the zero-based index of the first member in the
    arena team's internal member list. This value typically serves as a starting point
    for iteration operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Iteration
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(teamId);\nint beginIndex\
      \ = team->m_membersBegin();\nint endIndex = team->m_membersEnd();\nfor (int\
      \ i = beginIndex; i < endIndex; ++i)\n{\n    // Access member at index i\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena team data structure management.
    The actual implementation may vary depending on how members are stored internally
    (e.g., vector, list, etc.). Developers should not assume that the returned value
    will remain constant across multiple calls unless the team composition has not
    changed.
  warnings: Do not use this method directly for member access without proper bounds
    checking. Ensure that m_membersEnd() is called to determine valid iteration range.
    Using invalid indices can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
