documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LootEventBus class for handling loot-related
    events in the game world.
  description: The LootEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system responsible
    for managing and dispatching loot-related events within the TrinityCore framework.
    This class serves as a central hub for coordinating various loot activities such
    as item drops, loot distribution, and reward processing. The initialization process
    sets up internal data structures and registers necessary callbacks to ensure proper
    handling of loot events throughout the game lifecycle. It is typically invoked
    during server startup or when a new loot context needs to be established.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'LootEventBus eventBus;

      // The event bus is now ready to handle loot events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when setting up the loot system. Multiple
    instances of LootEventBus may exist in different contexts, but each instance manages
    its own set of loot events independently.
