  brief: Initializes a new LevelBracket object with default values.
  description: The LevelBracket constructor initializes a new instance of the LevelBracket
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, typically initializing
    member variables to their default values or zero states. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, LevelBracket likely represents a range of levels used
    for calculating player progression, loot distribution, or other level-based mechanics.
    The constructor ensures that the object is in a valid initial state before being
    used by other methods in the system.

  - title: Creating a new LevelBracket instance
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      // Initializes a new LevelBracket with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, meaning it takes no parameters. It's typically
    used to create objects that will be initialized later through other methods or
    assignment operations. The initialization performed by this constructor should
    be lightweight and not involve complex operations or database calls.
