documentation:
  brief: Processes active mitigation abilities for the Monk AI during combat.
  description: The HandleActiveMitigation method manages the application and execution
    of active mitigation abilities within the Monk AI system. This method is responsible
    for evaluating current combat conditions, determining when to activate defensive
    cooldowns or abilities such as Fortifying Brew, Diffuse Magic, or other mitigation
    mechanics specific to the monk class. It ensures that the AI appropriately uses
    its defensive resources based on incoming damage patterns and threat levels. The
    method typically runs during the AI's update cycle and interacts with the mob's
    health state, combat status, and ability cooldowns to make intelligent mitigation
    decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    HandleActiveMitigation();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations where the
    monk has valid mitigation abilities available. The implementation assumes that
    the AI's target and health state are properly initialized before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method outside of combat or without proper initialization
    can lead to incorrect ability usage or potential crashes. Ensure all preconditions
    are met before invoking HandleActiveMitigation.
