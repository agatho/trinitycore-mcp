  method: AssignTrashTargets
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::AssignTrashTargets(Group * group, const int & trashMobs)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns trash mobs to a group for dungeon encounters.
  description: The AssignTrashTargets method distributes enemy mob targets among players
    in a dungeon group during encounter progression. This method is typically invoked
    during dungeon instance creation or when adding new mobs to an existing encounter.
    It ensures that each player receives appropriate target assignments based on the
    current dungeon difficulty and group composition. The method handles the logic
    for distributing trash mobs across the group members, potentially assigning them
    to specific players or managing their spawn behavior within the dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players participating in the
      dungeon encounter. This parameter must be a valid group pointer; null pointers
      will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: trashMobs
    description: Integer value representing the number of trash mobs to assign to
      the group. Must be a non-negative integer indicating how many enemy units should
      be distributed among group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Instance
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (dungeonGroup)\n{\n    int\
      \ trashCount = 5;\n    dungeonBehavior->AssignTrashTargets(dungeonGroup, trashCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Trash Assignment Based on Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int difficulty =\
      \ instance->GetDifficulty();\n    int trashMobCount = 0;\n    \n    switch (difficulty)\n\
      \    {\n        case DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL:\n            trashMobCount =\
      \ 3;\n            break;\n        case DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC:\n        \
      \    trashMobCount = 6;\n            break;\n        default:\n            trashMobCount\
      \ = 4;\n            break;\n    }\n    \n    dungeonBehavior->AssignTrashTargets(group,\
      \ trashMobCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the dungeon's AI system to manage mob targeting
    and behavior. The assignment logic may consider player roles (tank, healer, damage
    dealer) and group size to distribute targets appropriately. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called sparingly during encounter initialization rather
    than repeatedly during active combat.
  warnings: Passing a null group pointer or negative trashMobCount values can lead
    to runtime errors or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group contains valid
    players before calling this method. The method may modify internal state of the
    dungeon behavior system, so calling it after encounters have started could cause
    unexpected results.
