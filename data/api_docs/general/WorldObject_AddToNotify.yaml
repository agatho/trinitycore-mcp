  brief: Adds the WorldObject to the notify list for update packets.
  description: This method adds the WorldObject to the notify list, which is used
    to determine which objects should be included in update packets sent to players.
    The method is typically called during object creation or when the object's visibility
    changes. It ensures that the object is properly tracked for updates and can be
    seen by nearby players. The 'f' parameter represents the flag used to determine
    what type of update packet this object should be included in.

    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject;

      // This adds the object to the notify list for low GUID updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object initialization or when visibility
    changes occur. It's important to note that this method does not directly send
    update packets, but rather prepares the object for inclusion in future update
    packets.
