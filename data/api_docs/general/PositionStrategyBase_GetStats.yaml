  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetStats
  signature: const PerformanceStats & PositionStrategyBase::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns performance statistics for the position strategy.
  description: The GetStats method retrieves a const reference to the PerformanceStats
    object that contains timing and execution metrics for the position strategy. This
    allows developers to monitor and analyze the performance characteristics of pathfinding
    or positioning logic within the TrinityCore AI system. The returned statistics
    typically include data such as average execution time, call count, and other relevant
    performance indicators that help in optimizing AI behavior and identifying bottlenecks
    in movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to a PerformanceStats object containing timing and execution
    metrics for the position strategy. This includes information about how long operations
    take, how frequently they're called, and other performance-related data points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = ...;

      const PerformanceStats& stats = strategy->GetStats();

      std::cout << "Average execution time: " << stats.averageTime << "ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorPositionStrategy(PositionStrategyBase* strategy) {\n    const\
      \ PerformanceStats& stats = strategy->GetStats();\n    if (stats.callCount >\
      \ 1000) {\n        LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"High call frequency detected: {} calls\"\
      , stats.callCount);\n    }\n    if (stats.averageTime > 50.0f) {\n        LOG_WARN(\"\
      ai\", \"Slow execution detected: {}ms average\", stats.averageTime);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PerformanceStats reference is valid only as long as the PositionStrategyBase
    instance exists and is not modified. This method is typically used for profiling
    and debugging AI behavior in TrinityCore's pathfinding system.
