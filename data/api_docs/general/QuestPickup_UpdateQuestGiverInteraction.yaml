  class: QuestPickup
  method: UpdateQuestGiverInteraction
  signature: void QuestPickup::UpdateQuestGiverInteraction(uint32 questGiverGuid,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest giver interaction state for a bot player based on the provided
    quest giver GUID.
  description: The UpdateQuestGiverInteraction method is responsible for managing
    and updating the state of a bot player's interaction with a specific quest giver
    in the World of Warcraft environment. This method ensures that the bot correctly
    tracks its relationship with quest givers, including accepting, completing, or
    declining quests. It typically handles internal state changes such as updating
    quest progress, marking quest givers as interacted with, and potentially triggering
    follow-up actions like quest completion rewards or next-step instructions. The
    method operates within the TrinityCore framework and is part of the broader quest
    management system for AI-controlled players (bots).
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity with which
      the bot interacts. This value must correspond to a valid GameObject or Creature
      in the game world.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot player that is
      interacting with the quest giver. Must not be null and should represent an active
      AI-controlled character.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Giver Interaction Update
    code: 'uint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;

      Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player pointer

      QuestPickup::UpdateQuestGiverInteraction(questGiverGuid, bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI decision-making processes when
    a bot needs to interact with a quest giver. It assumes the quest giver exists
    and is accessible in the game world. The internal implementation may involve updating
    database entries or in-memory state tracking for the bot's quest progress.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questGiverGuid corresponds to an actual quest
    giver in the game world; otherwise, the method may fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior. Also, make sure the bot pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method.
