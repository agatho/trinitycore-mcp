documentation:
  brief: Called after instance data has been loaded from the database
  description: The AfterDataLoad method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework after
    all instance-specific data has been successfully loaded from the database. This
    method provides a hook for custom instance scripts to perform initialization tasks
    that depend on loaded data, such as setting up object states, initializing variables
    based on saved values, or triggering events that require complete data context.
    The method is part of the InstanceScript lifecycle and ensures proper sequencing
    of data loading and script initialization.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic implementation example
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void AfterDataLoad()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Initialize variables based on loaded data\n  \
      \      if (GetBossState(BOSS_ENCOUNTER_1) == DONE)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Set up objects or states that depend on saved boss state\n            LoadObjectStates();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the instance initialization phase, after data
    has been loaded but before the instance is fully ready for gameplay. It's important
    to note that this method should not perform operations that require database access
    or modify data in a way that would conflict with the loading process.
