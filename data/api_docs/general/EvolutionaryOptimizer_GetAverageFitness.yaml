  method: GetAverageFitness
  signature: float EvolutionaryOptimizer::GetAverageFitness() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average fitness value of all individuals in the
    evolutionary optimization population.
  description: The GetAverageFitness method computes the arithmetic mean of fitness
    values across all individuals within the evolutionary optimizer's current population.
    This metric is commonly used to track the overall performance improvement of the
    evolutionary algorithm over successive generations. The method performs no modifications
    to internal state and is typically called during fitness evaluation or generation
    progression phases. It assumes that the population has been initialized and contains
    valid fitness data for all individuals.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the average fitness of all individuals
    in the current population. Returns 0.0 if the population is empty or if no fitness
    values have been calculated yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Evolution Progress
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... population initialized and evolved ...

      float avgFitness = optimizer.GetAverageFitness();

      printf("Current average fitness: %.4f\n", avgFitness);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Average Fitness for Convergence Check
    code: "EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;\n// ... evolution loop ...\nfloat prevAvg\
      \ = optimizer.GetAverageFitness();\n// ... run more generations ...\nfloat currAvg\
      \ = optimizer.GetAverageFitness();\nif (currAvg - prevAvg < 0.001f) {\n    printf(\"\
      Algorithm has converged\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve iterating through all individuals in the population,
    so performance could be impacted for very large populations. The calculation is
    thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications to the population occur during
    execution.
  warnings: The returned value will be inaccurate if fitness values have not been
    properly calculated or assigned to all individuals in the population before calling
    this method. Always ensure that the evolutionary process has completed at least
    one fitness evaluation cycle before relying on this metric.
