  method: LogDungeonEvent
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::LogDungeonEvent(uint32 groupId, const std::string
    & event, const std::string & details)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a dungeon event with associated group ID, event type, and details for
    tracking and analysis.
  description: The LogDungeonEvent method records specific events that occur within
    a dungeon environment, associating them with a unique group identifier. This functionality
    is typically used for tracking player progress, monitoring dungeon completion
    statistics, or logging significant gameplay moments such as boss kills, item acquisitions,
    or quest completions. The method allows developers and administrators to analyze
    dungeon behavior and player engagement patterns over time. Events are stored with
    their contextual details, which can be retrieved later for reporting or debugging
    purposes. This method is part of the DungeonBehavior class, which manages various
    aspects of dungeon-related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: A unique identifier representing the group or instance of players
      participating in the dungeon event. Valid values are positive integers corresponding
      to active dungeon groups within the game world.
  - name: event
    description: A string describing the type of dungeon event that occurred. This
      should be a meaningful identifier such as 'BossKill', 'ItemFound', or 'QuestComplete'.
      The value is case-sensitive and must match predefined event types expected by
      the logging system.
  - name: details
    description: A detailed description of the event, including relevant contextual
      information. This can include player names, item IDs, damage dealt, or other
      relevant data that helps in understanding the specific circumstances of the
      event occurrence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Event Logging
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeon;

      dungeon.LogDungeonEvent(12345, "BossKill", "Player1 killed BossA with 1000 damage");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Item Acquisition Event
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeon;

      dungeon.LogDungeonEvent(67890, "ItemFound", "Player2 obtained Rare Sword of
      Valor");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely writes to an internal database or log file for later analysis.
    It may be called from various game systems such as quest handlers, loot managers,
    or combat modules. The group ID should correspond to a valid active dungeon instance;
    otherwise, the event might not be properly tracked.
  warnings: Ensure that the event string matches predefined types expected by the
    logging system to avoid silent failures. Avoid logging sensitive player information
    without proper data sanitization to comply with privacy policies.
