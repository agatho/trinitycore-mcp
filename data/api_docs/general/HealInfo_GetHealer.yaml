documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the healer's unique identifier (GUID) associated with
    the heal information.
  description: The GetHealer method retrieves a pointer to the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the entity that performed the healing action. This GUID is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to identify players, NPCs, or other
    game objects involved in healing events. The returned pointer may be null if no
    healer is associated with the heal information, which can occur in certain special
    cases such as environment-based heals or self-heals without a specific source.
    This method is commonly used in combat log processing and damage/heal event handling
    within the TrinityCore server architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the healer, or nullptr
    if no healer is associated with the heal information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in heal event processing
    code: "void HandleHealEvent(HealInfo* info) {\n    int* healerGuid = info->GetHealer();\n\
      \    if (healerGuid != nullptr) {\n        // Process the healing event with\
      \ a valid healer\n        uint64 healerId = *healerGuid;\n        // ... additional\
      \ logic\n    } else {\n        // Handle case where no healer is specified\n\
      \        // This might be a self-heal or environment heal\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking healer type in combat log
    code: "void ProcessHealLog(HealInfo* info) {\n    int* healerGuid = info->GetHealer();\n\
      \    if (healerGuid != nullptr && *healerGuid != 0) {\n        uint64 guid =\
      \ *healerGuid;\n        if (ObjectGuid::IsPlayer(guid)) {\n            // This\
      \ was a player heal\n            Player* healer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ guid));\n            // ... process player heal\n        } else if (ObjectGuid::IsCreature(guid))\
      \ {\n            // This was an NPC heal\n            Creature* healer = ObjectAccessor::GetCreature(*m_session,\
      \ ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Unit, guid));\n            // ... process NPC heal\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to an internal member variable of the HealInfo
    class. Modifying the value pointed to by this pointer directly may affect the
    internal state of the HealInfo object. The method is marked as const, so it does
    not modify the HealInfo object's state. In TrinityCore, heal events are typically
    processed through combat log systems where healer identification is crucial for
    proper event tracking and reporting.
  warnings: Be sure to check if the returned pointer is null before dereferencing
    it. Dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also note that
    while this method returns an int*, the actual value stored is typically a uint64
    GUID, so be careful when casting or comparing values.
