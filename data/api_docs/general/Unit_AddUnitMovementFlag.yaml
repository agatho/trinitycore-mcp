  class: Unit
  method: AddUnitMovementFlag
  signature: void Unit::AddUnitMovementFlag(uint32 f)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a movement flag to the unit's movement state.
  description: This method adds a specific movement flag to the Unit's current movement
    state, allowing for precise control over how the unit moves within the game world.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to manage
    unit behavior during various gameplay scenarios such as combat, movement, or special
    abilities. The method operates on the unit's internal movement flags and modifies
    its state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The movement flag to be added to the unit's movement state. This
      is a uint32 value representing specific movement behavior flags that can be
      combined with other flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->AddUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING);

      // This adds the walking movement flag to the unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      uint32 flags = MOVEMENTFLAG_SPRINT | MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING;

      unit->AddUnitMovementFlag(flags);

      // This adds multiple movement flags to the unit''s movement state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods like SetUnitMovementFlag or RemoveUnitMovementFlag. It should be used
    carefully as it directly affects the unit's movement behavior and can influence
    combat mechanics, pathfinding, and other game systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected movement behavior or
    even complete loss of control over unit movement. Care should be taken when adding
    flags that may conflict with existing movement states.
