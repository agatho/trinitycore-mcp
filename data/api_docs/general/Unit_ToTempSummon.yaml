  brief: Returns the temporary summon identifier for the unit
  description: The ToTempSummon method retrieves the unique identifier associated
    with a temporary summoned creature or object. This identifier is typically used
    to track and manage temporary summons within the game world, allowing developers
    to distinguish between different temporary summon instances. The method returns
    a const int pointer which represents the GUID of the temporary summon, enabling
    proper identification and handling of summon-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const int pointer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the temporary summon. This value can be used to identify and manage specific temporary
    summon instances within the game world.

    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nconst int* summonId = unit->ToTempSummon();\nif\
      \ (summonId != nullptr) {\n    // Use the summonId to identify the temporary\
      \ summon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is typically used in conjunction
    with summoning mechanics. It should be used carefully as it may return null if
    no temporary summon exists.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as it may return nullptr if no temporary
    summon has been created or if the summon has already been removed from the game
    world.
