  brief: Returns the required skill value for a quest
  description: This method retrieves the minimum skill level required to complete
    a specific quest. The returned value represents the skill threshold that players
    must meet or exceed to be eligible for the quest. This is typically used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to determine quest eligibility and progression.
    The method is commonly employed in quest scripting and player interaction logic
    within TrinityCore's core.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the required skill level needed to
    complete the quest. This value corresponds to the minimum skill requirement for
    the quest, which can range from 0 to 450 depending on the quest's difficulty and
    requirements.
