  class: PositionManager
  method: ValidatePosition
  signature: bool PositionManager::ValidatePosition(const int & pos, PositionValidation
    flags)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a given position identifier is within acceptable bounds and
    meets validation criteria.
  description: The ValidatePosition method checks whether a provided position identifier
    is valid according to predefined rules and flags. It ensures that the position
    falls within expected boundaries and adheres to game-specific constraints such
    as map limits, instance validity, or coordinate restrictions. This method is typically
    used during movement validation, teleportation checks, or when processing player
    or object positions in the game world. The validation process may include checking
    for null or invalid coordinates, ensuring the position exists on a valid map,
    and confirming that the position meets any additional criteria defined by the
    PositionValidation flags.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier to validate. This is typically an integer
      representing a unique position index or coordinate value within the game world.
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask of PositionValidation flags that define which validation
      checks should be performed. These flags control aspects such as map boundary
      checking, instance validity, and coordinate range validation.
  returns: Returns true if the position identifier passes all specified validation
    checks; otherwise, returns false. A return value of false indicates that the position
    is either out of bounds, invalid, or does not meet the criteria defined by the
    provided flags.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "int playerPosition = 12345;\nPositionValidation validationFlags = POSITION_VALIDATION_MAP_BOUNDS\
      \ | POSITION_VALIDATION_COORDINATES;\nbool isValid = positionManager.ValidatePosition(playerPosition,\
      \ validationFlags);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement or teleportation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Validation with Multiple Flags
    code: "int npcPosition = 98765;\nPositionValidation flags = POSITION_VALIDATION_MAP_BOUNDS\
      \ | POSITION_VALIDATION_INSTANCE_VALIDITY | POSITION_VALIDATION_COORDINATE_RANGE;\n\
      bool result = positionManager.ValidatePosition(npcPosition, flags);\nif (!result)\n\
      {\n    // Log invalid position or prevent NPC movement\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid NPC position detected: %d\", npcPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in movement handling systems to ensure that
    positions are valid before allowing character movement or teleportation. The PositionValidation
    flags may vary depending on the context, such as whether the validation should
    include map boundaries, instance checks, or coordinate range limits. Performance-wise,
    this method should be efficient since it primarily performs boundary and flag-based
    checks rather than complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this method is not null
    or uninitialized, as this could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    different PositionValidation flags may have varying performance impacts depending
    on how many checks are enabled.
