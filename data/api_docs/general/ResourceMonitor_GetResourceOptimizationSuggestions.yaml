  method: GetResourceOptimizationSuggestions
  signature: int ResourceMonitor::GetResourceOptimizationSuggestions(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes resource usage and returns optimization suggestions for a specified
    bot
  description: The GetResourceOptimizationSuggestions method evaluates the current
    resource consumption patterns of a bot identified by its GUID and generates actionable
    recommendations to optimize memory, CPU, or other system resources. This method
    is typically used in automated bot management systems within TrinityCore to improve
    performance and reduce overhead. The returned value indicates the number of suggestions
    generated, with zero suggesting no optimization opportunities or an error occurred
    during analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which resource optimization
      suggestions are requested. Must be a valid existing bot GUID in the system.
  returns: An integer representing the count of optimization suggestions generated
    for the specified bot. Returns zero if no suggestions were found or an error occurred
    during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get optimization suggestions
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nint suggestionCount = resourceMonitor->GetResourceOptimizationSuggestions(botGuid);\n\
      if (suggestionCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process or display the suggestions\n   \
      \ printf(\"Found %d optimization suggestions\\n\", suggestionCount);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No optimization suggestions available or error occurred\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform resource-intensive operations depending on the complexity
    of the bot's current state. It should be called sparingly to avoid performance
    degradation in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active and valid bot;
    otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or errors.
