  method: GetConfidence
  signature: float OptimizationStrategy::GetConfidence() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the confidence level of the optimization strategy's decision-making
    process.
  description: The GetConfidence method retrieves a floating-point value representing
    how confident the OptimizationStrategy is in its current approach or decision.
    This value typically ranges from 0.0 (no confidence) to 1.0 (complete confidence),
    and is used internally by the AI system to evaluate strategy effectiveness and
    make informed decisions about strategy switching or refinement. The method does
    not take any parameters and is read-only, returning a constant value that reflects
    the internal state of the optimization strategy at the time of invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level of
    the optimization strategy. A value closer to 1.0 indicates higher confidence in
    the current strategy's effectiveness, while a value closer to 0.0 suggests low
    confidence or uncertainty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float confidence = strategy->GetConfidence();\nif (confidence < 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Consider switching strategies\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Evaluation
    code: "void EvaluateCurrentStrategy(OptimizationStrategy* strategy)\n{\n    float\
      \ confidence = strategy->GetConfidence();\n    if (confidence >= 0.9f)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Strategy is highly confident, continue using it\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      High confidence in current strategy: %.2f\", confidence);\n    }\n    else if\
      \ (confidence < 0.3f)\n    {\n        // Strategy has low confidence, consider\
      \ alternative approaches\n        sLog->outString(\"Low confidence in current\
      \ strategy: %.2f\", confidence);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to assess
    the reliability of a chosen optimization path. The returned value may be influenced
    by factors such as recent performance metrics, historical data, and environmental
    conditions within the game world.
