  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: GetNearestQuestHub
  signature: const QuestHub * QuestHubDatabase::GetNearestQuestHub(const Player *
    player) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the closest QuestHub to the specified player.
  description: The GetNearestQuestHub method searches through all registered quest
    hubs in the database and determines which one is geographically closest to the
    provided player. This method is typically used during quest interaction or NPC
    dialogue to identify the appropriate quest hub for a given player's location.
    The result is a pointer to a const QuestHub object, which represents the nearest
    available quest hub. If no quest hubs are registered or if the player is not in
    a valid world context, this method may return a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the const QuestHub object representing the nearest quest hub
    to the player. Returns nullptr if no valid quest hubs exist or if the player's
    location cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const QuestHub* hub = questHubDatabase.GetNearestQuestHub(player);\nif\
      \ (hub)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest hub interaction\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Closest quest hub: %s\", hub->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial search using the player's current coordinates.
    It assumes that QuestHub objects maintain valid location data and are properly
    registered in the database. Performance may be impacted if there are many quest
    hubs registered, though typical implementations use spatial indexing for optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object is valid and in a world context before calling
    this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior or crashes may occur. The returned
    pointer should always be checked for null before dereferencing to prevent runtime
    errors.
