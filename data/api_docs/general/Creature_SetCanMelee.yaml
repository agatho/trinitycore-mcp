  class: Creature
  method: SetCanMelee
  signature: void Creature::SetCanMelee(bool canMelee, bool fleeFromMelee)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature can perform melee attacks or not.
  description: This method controls whether a creature is allowed to engage in melee
    combat with targets. When set to true, the creature will be able to perform melee
    attacks; when set to false, it will not be able to engage in melee combat. The
    second parameter 'fleeFromMelee' determines if the creature should flee from melee
    attacks when disabled. This method is typically used during AI scripting or creature
    behavior modifications to control combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: canMelee
    description: If true, the creature can perform melee attacks; if false, it cannot
      engage in melee combat.
  - name: fleeFromMelee
    description: If true, the creature will flee from melee attacks when canMelee
      is set to false. This parameter controls the behavior of the creature during
      combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetCanMelee(true, false);

      // Creature now can perform melee attacks'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetCanMelee(false, true);

      // Creature will flee from melee attacks when disabled'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's AI behavior and combat mechanics. It should
    be used carefully during AI scripting to ensure proper creature behavior. The
    method does not directly affect the creature's movement or attack speed, but rather
    its ability to engage in melee combat.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to creatures being unable to fight
    or flee from combat when they should be able to. Care should be taken when setting
    canMelee to false, as it may cause the creature to become stuck in combat or unable
    to respond to attacks.
