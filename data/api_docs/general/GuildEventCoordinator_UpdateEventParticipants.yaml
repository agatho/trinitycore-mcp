  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::UpdateEventParticipants(uint32 eventId, const
    std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the participant list for a specified guild event with a notification
    message.
  description: The UpdateEventParticipants method is responsible for refreshing and
    notifying all participants of a specific guild event identified by its unique
    event ID. It sends out a message to all players currently registered or eligible
    to attend the event, ensuring they are informed about any changes or updates.
    This method typically integrates with the game's guild event system to maintain
    real-time communication between the event coordinator and guild members. The method
    does not return any value but triggers internal updates within the GuildEventCoordinator
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier representing the specific guild event to update.
      This ID must correspond to an existing event in the system, otherwise the operation
      may fail silently or produce undefined behavior.
  - name: message
    description: The notification message to be sent to all participants of the specified
      guild event. This string can contain formatting codes and is typically used
      to inform players about event changes, start times, or other relevant information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventParticipants(12345, "Guild raid starts in 5 minutes!");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Message
    code: 'std::string eventMessage = "Event has been moved to a new time: " + GetTimeString();

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventParticipants(67890, eventMessage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal lookups of registered participants for
    the given event ID and broadcasts messages through the game's messaging system.
    It may involve synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety when updating
    shared event data.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId corresponds to an actual existing event, as invalid
    IDs might lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior. Also, be cautious about
    sending large message payloads which could impact performance or cause client-side
    lag.
