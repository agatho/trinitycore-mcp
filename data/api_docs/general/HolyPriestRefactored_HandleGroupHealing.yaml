  class: HolyPriestRefactored
  method: HandleGroupHealing
  signature: bool HolyPriestRefactored::HandleGroupHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs group healing for the specified group using Holy Priest abilities
  description: The HandleGroupHealing method executes a group healing operation for
    the Holy Priest class, targeting a specific group within the game world. This
    method typically utilizes healing spells such as Flash Heal or Greater Heal to
    restore health to multiple group members simultaneously. The method checks if
    the priest has sufficient mana and if the target group is valid before initiating
    the healing sequence. It returns true upon successful execution and false if the
    operation fails due to insufficient resources, invalid targets, or other game
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The identifier of the group to be healed. This value typically represents
      a group index or GUID within the TrinityCore framework, indicating which group
      members should receive healing effects.
  returns: Returns true if the group healing was successfully executed and all targets
    received healing effects; returns false if the operation failed due to insufficient
    mana, invalid group reference, or other execution constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Healing Usage
    code: "HolyPriestRefactored priest;\nint groupId = 1;\nbool result = priest.HandleGroupHealing(groupId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Healing was successful\n    printf(\"Group healed successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Healing failed\n    printf(\"Failed to heal group\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Holy Priest has access to appropriate healing
    spells and sufficient mana. It may interact with TrinityCore's group management
    system to identify valid targets within the specified group. The method should
    only be called when the priest is in a valid state for casting group healing spells.
  warnings: Ensure that the group identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual group in the game world; otherwise, the method may fail silently
    or cause unexpected behavior. Also, verify that the priest has enough mana before
    calling this method to avoid unnecessary failures.
