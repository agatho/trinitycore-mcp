  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: Instance
  signature: CriteriaMgr * CriteriaMgr::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CriteriaMgr class for managing achievement
    criteria.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the CriteriaMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This manager is responsible for handling all achievement criteria related
    logic, including tracking progress, validating requirements, and updating player
    achievements. The method performs lazy initialization if the instance has not
    yet been created, making it thread-safe in most TrinityCore configurations. It
    serves as the central access point for all criteria-related operations within
    the game's achievement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of CriteriaMgr. The returned pointer
    is never null under normal operation, as the singleton pattern guarantees its
    existence.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Criteria Manager
    code: 'CriteriaMgr* criteriaManager = CriteriaMgr::Instance();

      // Use criteriaManager to access achievement criteria functionality

      Player* player = ...;

      criteriaManager->UpdateCriteria(player, CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST, 12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern and is typically called
    during server initialization or when handling achievement-related events. The
    CriteriaMgr instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime
    of the application.
