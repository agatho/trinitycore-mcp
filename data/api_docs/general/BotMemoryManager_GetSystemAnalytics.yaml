  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: GetSystemAnalytics
  signature: SystemMemoryAnalytics BotMemoryManager::GetSystemAnalytics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves system memory analytics data from the bot memory manager.
  description: The GetSystemAnalytics method retrieves comprehensive system memory
    usage statistics and related metrics from the BotMemoryManager instance. This
    data typically includes information about allocated memory, used memory, available
    memory, and other relevant system-level memory performance indicators. The returned
    SystemMemoryAnalytics object encapsulates these values in a structured format
    that can be used for monitoring, debugging, or optimizing bot memory consumption
    within the TrinityCore environment. The method is designed to provide insights
    into how memory resources are being utilized by the bot system without requiring
    direct access to low-level system APIs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SystemMemoryAnalytics object containing detailed system memory usage
    statistics including allocated memory, used memory, available memory, and other
    relevant metrics that describe the current state of system memory as observed
    by the bot memory manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      SystemMemoryAnalytics analytics = memoryManager.GetSystemAnalytics();

      std::cout << "Used Memory: " << analytics.usedMemory << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
    The returned data may be cached or updated periodically depending on the implementation.
    It's recommended to call this method sparingly in performance-critical sections
    of code as it might involve system calls or memory operations that could impact
    performance.
