  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::DeleteAllBattlegrounds()
documentation:
  brief: Deletes all active battleground instances from memory.
  description: The DeleteAllBattlegrounds method is responsible for removing and cleaning
    up all currently active battleground instances within the BattlegroundMgr. This
    operation typically occurs during server shutdown, reloads, or when resetting
    battleground configurations. The method ensures that no lingering battleground
    data remains in memory, preventing potential memory leaks or conflicts during
    subsequent operations. It iterates through all existing battlegrounds and properly
    disposes of their resources, including player assignments, scoring systems, and
    game state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Shutdown Cleanup
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // During server shutdown\n    sBattlegroundMgr->DeleteAllBattlegrounds();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to terminate all battleground
    instances. It is typically invoked during server maintenance or shutdown procedures.
    The operation may cause active players to be teleported out of battlegrounds,
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Using this method while battlegrounds are actively in progress may result
    in unexpected behavior for players currently participating in those battlegrounds.
    Ensure all battlegrounds are properly ended before calling this method.
