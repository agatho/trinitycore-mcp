  class: LootCoordination
  method: CoordinateGroupLootDecisions
  signature: void LootCoordination::CoordinateGroupLootDecisions(Group * group, uint32
    rollId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates loot decisions for a group based on a rolling mechanism.
  description: The CoordinateGroupLootDecisions method manages the process of determining
    how loot should be distributed among group members when a roll is required. It
    evaluates the results of individual player rolls and applies the appropriate loot
    distribution rules, such as need before greed or free-for-all looting. This method
    ensures that group loot is handled consistently according to the group's loot
    settings and individual player decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which loot decisions are being coordinated.
      Must be a valid group with active members.
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific roll event being processed. Used
      to track and match individual player rolls to the correct loot item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 rollId = 12345;

      LootCoordination::CoordinateGroupLootDecisions(group, rollId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's loot master system and may
    trigger item distribution or notification events. It should only be called when
    a group has active loot rolls in progress.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and that the rollId corresponds
    to an actual ongoing roll event. Calling this method without proper setup may
    result in undefined behavior or failed loot distribution.
