  class: WarlockAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HasEnoughResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warlock has sufficient resource requirements to cast
    a specified spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates if the current WarlockAI instance
    possesses adequate resources, such as soul shards, mana, or other spell-specific
    requirements, to successfully cast the given spell. This method is typically used
    during AI decision-making processes to prevent casting spells that would fail
    due to insufficient resources. The method checks against the warlock's current
    resource state and compares it with the resource cost defined for the specified
    spell ID. It returns true if all necessary resources are available, otherwise
    false.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to a spell in the game's database and defines the required
      resources such as mana cost, soul shard count, or other consumable costs.
  returns: Returns true if the warlock has sufficient resources to cast the specified
    spell; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (warlockAI->HasEnoughResource(686)) {\n    // Cast Shadow Bolt\n   \
      \ warlockAI->DoCastVictim(686);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting with Resource Check
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 1725; // Corruption\nif (warlockAI->HasEnoughResource(spellToCast))\
      \ {\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_SOUL_SHARDS) >= 1) {\n        warlockAI->DoCastVictim(spellToCast);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the AI's resource tracking system.
    It should be called before attempting to cast a spell to avoid failed casts and
    wasted actions. The implementation may consider various resource types including
    mana, soul shards, and other class-specific resources.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to an actual valid spell in the game database;
    otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does not account for temporary buffs
    or debuffs that might affect resource costs.
