  method: GetConfig
  signature: const Config & BotSpawnerOptimized::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the configuration object used by the BotSpawnerOptimized
    class.
  description: The GetConfig method provides access to the internal configuration
    settings of the BotSpawnerOptimized class. This method allows external code to
    read the current configuration parameters without modifying them. The returned
    reference points to an immutable Config object that contains various settings
    related to bot spawning behavior, such as spawn rates, limits, and other operational
    parameters. This method is typically used during runtime to retrieve configuration
    values for logging, debugging, or dynamic adjustment of bot spawning logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the internal Config object that holds all configuration
    settings for the BotSpawnerOptimized instance. The returned reference ensures
    that the configuration cannot be modified through this interface, maintaining
    data integrity.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Configuration Settings
    code: 'const Config& config = botSpawner.GetConfig();

      uint32 maxBots = config.GetValue<uint32>("MaxBotsPerInstance");

      bool enableLogging = config.GetValue<bool>("EnableBotLogging");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading Configuration for Debugging
    code: "void DebugSpawnerConfig(BotSpawnerOptimized& spawner) {\n    const Config&\
      \ config = spawner.GetConfig();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"BotSpawner\
      \ Config - MaxBots: %u, SpawnRate: %.2f\",\n                config.GetValue<uint32>(\"\
      MaxBotsPerInstance\"),\n                config.GetValue<float>(\"SpawnRateMultiplier\"\
      ));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Config reference is valid only as long as the BotSpawnerOptimized
    instance exists. This method performs no locking or synchronization, so concurrent
    access to the configuration from multiple threads should be handled by the caller
    if necessary. The configuration object is typically initialized during class construction
    and may not change during runtime unless explicitly modified through other methods.
  warnings: Avoid storing the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the BotSpawnerOptimized
    instance, as this will result in a dangling reference. Since the Config object
    is returned as const, any attempt to modify it through this interface will result
    in compilation errors.
