  method: CallScriptOnHitHandlers
  signature: void Spell::CallScriptOnHitHandlers()
documentation:
  brief: Executes all registered script handlers for the spell's OnHit event.
  description: The CallScriptOnHitHandlers method triggers all script callbacks that
    have been registered to handle the OnHit event of a spell. This method is typically
    invoked during the spell's execution phase when the spell successfully hits a
    target. It allows custom scripts (such as those defined in SpellScripts or other
    scripting systems) to modify or extend the behavior of the spell at the moment
    of impact. The method does not take any parameters and does not return a value,
    but it may affect the spell's outcome through side effects in the registered handlers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within spell execution
    code: "void MySpellScript::OnHit()\n{\n    // Custom logic before calling base\
      \ handler\n    spell->CallScriptOnHitHandlers();\n    // Custom logic after\
      \ calling base handler\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core spell system during
    spell processing, particularly in the context of spell hit handling. Developers
    should ensure that any scripts attached to this event do not cause infinite recursion
    or significantly impact performance.
  warnings: Improperly implemented script handlers may lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Avoid modifying critical spell state within these handlers unless
    necessary, and be cautious of potential reentrancy issues.
