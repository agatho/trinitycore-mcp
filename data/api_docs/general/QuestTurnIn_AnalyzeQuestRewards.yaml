  signature: void QuestTurnIn::AnalyzeQuestRewards(QuestTurnInData & turnInData, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes quest rewards for a bot player based on turn-in data.
  description: The AnalyzeQuestRewards method processes the reward data associated
    with a quest turn-in operation for a bot player. It evaluates the potential rewards,
    including experience points, gold, items, and reputation gains, and prepares this
    information for further processing or decision-making within the AI system. This
    method is typically invoked during quest completion logic to determine what benefits
    the bot should expect from turning in a specific quest. The analysis considers
    various factors such as player level, quest difficulty, and reward modifiers that
    may affect the final reward distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: turnInData
    description: Reference to QuestTurnInData structure containing information about
      the quest turn-in, including quest ID, reward details, and related metadata.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      the quest turn-in. This player's state and attributes are used in the reward
      analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Analysis
    code: 'QuestTurnInData data;

      data.questId = 12345;

      Player* botPlayer = ...; // Get bot player reference

      questTurnIn.AnalyzeQuestRewards(data, botPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Reward Data After Analysis
    code: 'QuestTurnInData data;

      data.questId = 12345;

      Player* botPlayer = ...;

      questTurnIn.AnalyzeQuestRewards(data, botPlayer);

      // Access analyzed reward information

      uint32 experience = data.rewardExperience;

      uint32 gold = data.rewardGold;

      std::vector<ItemTemplate*> items = data.rewardItems;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the QuestTurnInData structure in-place to store analyzed
    reward information. The bot player's current state, such as level and faction,
    directly influences how rewards are calculated. Ensure that the turnInData structure
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the QuestTurnInData
    structure may result in undefined behavior or incorrect reward calculations. The
    method assumes valid player data and does not perform extensive validation on
    input parameters.
