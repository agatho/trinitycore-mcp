documentation:
  brief: Updates the Ironskin Brew buff state for the Brewmaster Monk, applying or
    removing the defensive aura based on current conditions.
  description: The UpdateIronskinBrew method manages the internal state and application
    of the Ironskin Brew ability for a Brewmaster Monk class. This method is typically
    invoked during combat updates or when the monk's resource levels change, ensuring
    that the defensive buff is correctly applied or removed from the player character.
    It evaluates whether the monk has sufficient brew charges to maintain the effect,
    checks for active cooldowns, and updates the unit's aura state accordingly. The
    method also handles the visual and gameplay effects associated with the Ironskin
    Brew buff, such as damage reduction and status indicators.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyBrewmasterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateIronskinBrew();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Trigger for Buff Management
    code: "void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::OnBrewConsumed()\n{\n    // Re-evaluate\
      \ Ironskin Brew after consuming a brew\n    UpdateIronskinBrew();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the monk's state has changed in a
    way that could affect the Ironskin Brew buff. It is recommended to call this method
    during regular AI update cycles or after brewing actions to maintain proper buff
    state synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate contexts (e.g., during initialization
    or in non-combat situations) may result in incorrect buff application or removal,
    potentially causing gameplay inconsistencies or visual glitches.
