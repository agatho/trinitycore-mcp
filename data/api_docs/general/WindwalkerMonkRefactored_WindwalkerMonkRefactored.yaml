  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::WindwalkerMonkRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Windwalker Monk AI bot with the specified player reference.
  description: The WindwalkerMonkRefactored constructor initializes a Windwalker Monk
    AI behavior for a given player. This method sets up the bot's internal state,
    including class-specific abilities, talents, and combat strategies tailored for
    the Windwalker Monk specialization. The initialization process configures the
    bot to follow Windwalker Monk gameplay mechanics such as managing chi resources,
    executing appropriate abilities based on combat situations, and maintaining optimal
    stance and movement patterns during encounters. This constructor is typically
    called when creating or spawning a new Windwalker Monk AI instance within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Windwalker Monk Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Obtain player reference

      WindwalkerMonkRefactored windwalkerBot(botPlayer);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to an existing player object. The
    method does not perform any validation on the player's class or specialization
    - it assumes the player is a Windwalker Monk.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player reference points to a valid, initialized
    player object with proper Windwalker Monk class data before calling this constructor.
