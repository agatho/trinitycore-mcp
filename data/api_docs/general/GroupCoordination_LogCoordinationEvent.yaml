documentation:
  brief: Logs a coordination event with the specified message to the group coordination
    system
  description: The LogCoordinationEvent method records a coordination event within
    the GroupCoordination class, allowing for tracking and monitoring of group-related
    activities. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to maintain logs of events such as group member joins, exits, role assignments,
    or other significant coordination actions. The event string parameter provides
    contextual information about what occurred during the group's operation. This
    logging mechanism supports debugging, auditing, and maintaining game state consistency
    across group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A string describing the coordination event that occurred. This should
      be a meaningful message that identifies the nature of the event such as 'Player
      joined group', 'Leader changed', or 'Role assignment completed'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Logging
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      coordination.LogCoordinationEvent("Player A joined the group");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Role Assignment
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      coordination.LogCoordinationEvent("Player B assigned as tank role");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal logging mechanisms to store events in memory
    or write them to a persistent log file. It may be thread-safe depending on implementation,
    but developers should verify concurrent access patterns if used in multi-threaded
    contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that event strings do not contain sensitive information or personal
    data as they might be logged to public-facing logs. Avoid logging excessively
    frequent events without batching to prevent performance degradation.
