  signature: void GroupFormation::UpdateMemberPositions()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positional data of all group members in the formation.
  description: The UpdateMemberPositions method recalculates and synchronizes the
    current positions of all players within a group formation. This method is typically
    invoked when group members move, change their location, or when the group's formation
    needs to be refreshed to maintain proper positioning for coordinated actions such
    as raids or battlegrounds. It ensures that each member's position reflects their
    actual in-game coordinates and maintains the integrity of the group's tactical
    layout.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->UpdateMemberPositions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game engine when group movement
    occurs, but can also be manually invoked if custom positioning logic is required.
    Performance-wise, it iterates through all group members and updates their positions,
    so frequent calls may impact performance in large groups.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively during high-frequency movement events
    as it could cause unnecessary overhead. Ensure that the group is valid before
    calling this method to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.
