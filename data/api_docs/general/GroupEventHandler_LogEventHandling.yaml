  class: GroupEventHandler

  signature: void GroupEventHandler::LogEventHandling(const GroupEvent & event, const
    std::string & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs group event handling information including event details and associated
    action.
  description: The LogEventHandling method records detailed information about a group
    event and the action taken in response to it. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to track and debug group-related activities such as
    player joins, leaves, or role changes. It provides visibility into how group events
    are processed by the server, which is crucial for maintaining game stability and
    diagnosing issues related to group management. The logging mechanism ensures that
    all event handling actions are traceable for developers and administrators.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing details about the group event that
      occurred, including event type, affected players, and contextual data.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action taken in response to the group event,
      such as 'player joined', 'player left', or 'leader changed'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      event.type = GroupEventType::PLAYER_JOINED;

      event.playerGuid = 12345;

      std::string action = "player joined group";

      groupEventHandler.LogEventHandling(event, action);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Action
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      event.type = GroupEventType::LEADER_CHANGED;

      event.playerGuid = 67890;

      std::string action = "leader changed to player " + std::to_string(event.playerGuid);

      groupEventHandler.LogEventHandling(event, action);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses TrinityCore's logging infrastructure to write entries
    to the server logs. It is important to note that excessive logging can impact
    performance in high-traffic environments. The method should be used primarily
    for debugging and monitoring purposes rather than frequent runtime operations.
  warnings: Ensure that sensitive player data is not included in the action string
    or event details to prevent exposure in log files. Avoid calling this method in
    performance-critical code paths as it may introduce latency due to logging overhead.
