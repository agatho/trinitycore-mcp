  method: Initialize
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player bot packet sniffer to begin capturing and processing
    network packets.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the PlayerbotPacketSniffer class for
    monitoring incoming and outgoing network packets related to player bots. This
    method prepares internal data structures, registers necessary callbacks, and configures
    the sniffer to start intercepting packet data. It is typically called during the
    initialization phase of the player bot system to ensure that all packet handling
    functionality is ready for use. The method does not require any preconditions
    beyond the class being properly instantiated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;

      sniffer.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a PlayerbotPacketSniffer
    instance. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process is non-blocking and typically completes quickly, but may
    take longer depending on system resources and packet processing complexity.
