documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OutdoorPvP instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the OutdoorPvP class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources associated with the OutdoorPvP
    object. This includes unregistering the OutdoorPvP from the global OutdoorPvP
    manager, removing any references to game objects or players within the PvP area,
    and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur when the object is
    destroyed. The destructor is automatically invoked when an OutdoorPvP instance
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of OutdoorPvP instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    OutdoorPvP* pvp = new OutdoorPvP();\n    //\
      \ ... use the OutdoorPvP object ...\n    delete pvp; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It's important to ensure that all references to the OutdoorPvP object
    are removed before destruction to prevent access violations. The destructor may
    also trigger cleanup of related game state, such as updating player states or
    removing PvP-related triggers.
