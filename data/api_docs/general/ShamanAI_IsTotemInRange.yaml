api:
  class: ShamanAI
  method: IsTotemInRange
  signature: bool ShamanAI::IsTotemInRange(TotemType type, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a totem of the specified type is within range of the shaman's current
    target.
  description: The IsTotemInRange method determines whether a totem of the given type
    is currently within the effective range of the shaman's target. This is crucial
    for Shaman AI behavior, particularly when deciding whether to cast or reposition
    totems. The method evaluates the distance between the shaman and their current
    target, and compares it against the maximum range at which the specified totem
    type can be effectively placed or maintained. It accounts for the shaman's current
    positioning and target selection state, making it an essential part of totem management
    logic in the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The TotemType enum value specifying which type of totem to check
      for range. Valid values include AIR_TOTEM, EARTH_TOTEM, FIRE_TOTEM, and WATER_TOTEM.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the index of the target
      unit if the totem is in range. This parameter may be NULL if the caller does
      not need the specific target index.
  returns: Returns true if a totem of the specified type is within range of the current
    target, false otherwise. The method returns false when no valid target exists
    or when the totem cannot be placed within the required range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for Earth Totem range
    code: "if (shamanAI->IsTotemInRange(EARTH_TOTEM, nullptr)) {\n    // Earth totem\
      \ is in range\n    // Proceed with earth totem related actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with target index retrieval
    code: "int targetIndex = -1;\nif (shamanAI->IsTotemInRange(FIRE_TOTEM, &targetIndex))\
      \ {\n    // Fire totem is in range\n    // Use targetIndex to determine which\
      \ unit is being targeted\n    printf(\"Fire totem in range for target %d\\n\"\
      , targetIndex);\n} else {\n    // Fire totem not in range\n    // Consider moving\
      \ or casting a new totem\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the Shaman AI's decision-making loop
    to evaluate the positioning of totems relative to the current target. It considers
    the shaman's current position, target distance, and totem placement mechanics.
    The method may be called frequently during AI updates, so performance is important
    for smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the TotemType parameter passed is valid; invalid values may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect range calculations. Be cautious when using
    the target pointer as it can be NULL if not needed by the caller.
