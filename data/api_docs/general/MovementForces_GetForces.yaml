documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant pointer to the internal array of forces applied to the
    movement.
  description: The GetForces method provides access to the internal force data structure
    that represents various physical forces acting on a movement object. This method
    returns a const int* pointer which points to an array of integer values representing
    different force components (such as x, y, z coordinates or magnitude and direction).
    The returned pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal
    data managed by the MovementForces class. The data is typically used in physics
    calculations for character movement, object positioning, or trajectory prediction
    within the TrinityCore engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointer to an array of integers representing force components.
    The caller must not modify the data pointed to by this pointer. The array size
    and meaning of individual elements depend on the specific implementation and usage
    context of the MovementForces class.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Force Components
    code: "MovementForces forces;\nconst int* forceData = forces.GetForces();\nif\
      \ (forceData != nullptr) {\n    int xForce = forceData[0];\n    int yForce =\
      \ forceData[1];\n    int zForce = forceData[2];\n    // Use force components\
      \ for movement calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Force Values
    code: "MovementForces forces;\nconst int* forceArray = forces.GetForces();\nfor\
      \ (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n    std::cout << \"Force component \" << i << \"\
      : \" << forceArray[i] << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is only valid while the MovementForces object remains
    in scope and has not been modified. The actual size of the force array depends
    on the implementation details and may vary between different versions or subclasses
    of MovementForces. This method provides read-only access to internal data, so
    modifications should be made through appropriate setter methods rather than direct
    pointer manipulation.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or delete the memory pointed to by the returned
    pointer as it is managed internally by the MovementForces class. Modifying the
    values through this pointer directly can lead to undefined behavior and inconsistent
    state within the movement system. Always check for null return values before dereferencing
    the pointer.
