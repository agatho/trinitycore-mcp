  signature: void AreaTrigger::RemoveAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified flag from the area trigger's field flags.
  description: The RemoveAreaTriggerFlag method removes a specific AreaTriggerFieldFlags
    flag from the internal flag set of an area trigger. This operation modifies the
    area trigger's state by clearing the designated bit within its flags field. The
    method is typically used during area trigger lifecycle management, such as when
    deactivating or modifying the behavior of an area trigger. It operates on the
    assumption that the area trigger object has already been initialized and is in
    a valid state for flag manipulation.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The AreaTriggerFieldFlags value to be removed from the area trigger's
      flags. This parameter specifies which particular flag bit should be cleared
      in the internal flag storage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a single flag
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume valid area trigger

      trigger->RemoveAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_HAS_VISUAL);

      // The visual flag is now cleared from the area trigger'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing multiple flags in sequence
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->RemoveAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_HAS_VISUAL);

      trigger->RemoveAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_IS_ACTIVE);

      // Both flags are cleared from the area trigger'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal flag storage of the area trigger.
    It is recommended to ensure that the area trigger object is properly initialized
    before calling this method. The operation is atomic for a single flag removal,
    but multiple calls should be considered carefully in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid area trigger instance
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the area trigger has been properly
    constructed and is in a valid state before removing flags. Also, be cautious when
    removing flags that might affect gameplay mechanics such as activation states
    or visual effects.
