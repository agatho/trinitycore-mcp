api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ExecuteOpportunisticStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteOpportunisticStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the opportunistic auction strategy for a given player session.
  description: The ExecuteOpportunisticStrategy method implements an auction behavior
    where the system automatically identifies and acts on profitable opportunities
    within the auction house. This typically involves scanning available auctions,
    evaluating potential bids or sales based on market conditions, and executing transactions
    that maximize profit or meet predefined criteria. The method operates within the
    context of a specific player's session and may interact with the auction house
    database to retrieve and update auction listings. It is designed to be called
    during periodic maintenance routines or in response to specific game events that
    trigger opportunistic trading behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for whom the strategy is executed.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object containing session-specific
      data and state information required for executing the auction strategy.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with relevant data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteOpportunisticStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of automated auction house management
    and may perform database operations. It assumes that the provided player ID and
    session are valid and properly initialized. The strategy logic may vary depending
    on server configuration settings or game rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    about concurrent access to auction data structures when this method is called
    from multiple threads.
