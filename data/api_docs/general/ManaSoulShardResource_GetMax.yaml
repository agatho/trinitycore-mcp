  class: ManaSoulShardResource
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 ManaSoulShardResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum value of mana soul shards that can be stored in the resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of mana soul shards that
    the ManaSoulShardResource can hold. This value typically represents the player's
    maximum capacity for mana soul shards, which may vary based on character level,
    class, equipped items, or other game mechanics. The returned value is constant
    and does not change during gameplay unless modified by external effects or system
    updates. This method is commonly used to determine resource limits for UI display,
    calculations, or validation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of mana soul shards that
    can be stored in this resource. The value is always non-negative and typically
    corresponds to the player's current maximum capacity for mana soul shards.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxShards = player->GetManaSoulShardResource()->GetMax();

      printf("Maximum mana soul shards: %u\n", maxShards);'
    language: cpp
  - title: UI Display Example
    code: 'ManaSoulShardResource* resource = player->GetManaSoulShardResource();

      uint32 current = resource->GetCurrent();

      uint32 max = resource->GetMax();

      printf("Mana Soul Shards: %u/%u\n", current, max);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly returns a cached value stored within the resource object. The maximum
    value may be influenced by player level, class-specific bonuses, or temporary
    buffs that modify resource capacity.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called on a valid ManaSoulShardResource instance
    to avoid undefined behavior. While the method itself does not modify state, calling
    it on a null pointer will result in a crash.
