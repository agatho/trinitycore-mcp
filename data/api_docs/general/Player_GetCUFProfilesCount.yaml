  method: GetCUFProfilesCount
  signature: uint8 Player::GetCUFProfilesCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of CUF profiles configured for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the number of custom unit frames (CUF) profiles
    that have been configured for the player character. CUF profiles are used in World
    of Warcraft to define how unit frames should be displayed, including their layout
    and configuration settings. The returned value represents the total number of
    active CUF profile configurations available for this player, which can be used
    to determine how many different unit frame setups exist. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with other CUF-related methods to manage or query player's
    unit frame configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the count of CUF profiles configured
    for this player, which can range from 0 to 255 depending on how many profiles
    are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 profileCount = player->GetCUFProfilesCount();\nif (profileCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has at least one CUF profile configured\n    // Do something\
      \ with the profile count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CUF system implementation in TrinityCore and should
    be used carefully when managing player unit frame configurations. The value returned
    may vary based on player's configuration and can be influenced by game mechanics
    such as character level or class-specific settings.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not reflect actual active
    profiles if the player has not configured any CUF profiles yet. Also, this method
    does not validate whether the profiles are actually active or valid, so additional
    checks may be needed for robust usage.
