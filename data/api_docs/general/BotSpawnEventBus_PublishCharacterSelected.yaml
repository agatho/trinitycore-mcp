  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: PublishCharacterSelected
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::PublishCharacterSelected(int characterGuid, const
    int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all subscribed handlers that a bot character has been selected.
  description: The PublishCharacterSelected method is used to broadcast an event throughout
    the TrinityCore system when a bot character is chosen by a player. This method
    serves as part of the event bus pattern, allowing various subsystems (such as
    AI logic, spawn managers, or game state controllers) to react to the selection
    of a bot character. It takes in the unique identifier of the selected character
    and a reference to the request that initiated the selection. The method does not
    return any value but ensures that all registered listeners are informed about
    this event.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character that was
      selected. This is typically a 32-bit integer used to uniquely identify the character
      within the game world.
  - name: request
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the request associated
      with the character selection. This may be used to distinguish between different
      types of selection requests or actions that led to this event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Selection Handler
    code: "void OnBotSelected(int guid, const int& requestId) {\n    // Notify all\
      \ subscribers about the character selection\n    BotSpawnEventBus::Instance()->PublishCharacterSelected(guid,\
      \ requestId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class AIBotManager {\npublic:\n    void HandleCharacterSelection(int guid,\
      \ const int& request) {\n        // Perform actions based on character selection\n\
      \        if (request == 1) {\n            // Initialize bot for combat\n   \
      \         InitializeCombatBot(guid);\n        } else {\n            // Initialize\
      \ bot for exploration\n            InitializeExplorationBot(guid);\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n};\n\n// Register handler with event bus\nBotSpawnEventBus::Instance()->SubscribeCharacterSelected(&AIBotManager::HandleCharacterSelection);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core game loop or in response
    to player input. It's important to ensure that the event bus is properly initialized
    before calling this method, and that subscribers are registered before any events
    are published.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotSpawnEventBus
    may lead to undefined behavior. Also, since it's a void function, there is no
    way to verify whether the event was successfully delivered to all subscribers.
