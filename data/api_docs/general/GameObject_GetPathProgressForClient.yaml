  signature: int GameObject::GetPathProgressForClient() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current movement path progress for the client of a game object.
  description: This method retrieves the progress of the movement path that a GameObject
    is following, which is essential for determining the current position and state
    of the object during its movement. The returned value represents the index within
    the path's waypoints, indicating how far along the path the object has moved.
    This is particularly important for handling dynamic object movement in World of
    Warcraft, such as when an object is moving between waypoints or when a path is
    being executed by the client. It can be used to determine if an object is at a
    specific waypoint or to track its progress through a path.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current path progress index, where
    0 indicates the beginning of the path and higher values indicate progression along
    the path. The value may be -1 if no path exists or if the object is not actively
    moving.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int progress = gameObject->GetPathProgressForClient();\nif (progress >=\
      \ 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Current path progress: \" << progress << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"No path or object not moving\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement path data to determine
    the current state of an object's movement. It should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where path updates may occur, as it might return stale values if
    not properly synchronized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios involving dynamic path
    updates or when object movement is being modified by other systems; the returned
    value may become outdated if the path changes during execution.
