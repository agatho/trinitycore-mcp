api:
  class: PlayerSkillProfile
  method: GetRecentPerformance
  signature: PerformanceWindow PlayerSkillProfile::GetRecentPerformance() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the recent performance window data for the player's skill profile.
  description: The GetRecentPerformance method returns a PerformanceWindow object
    that encapsulates the most recent skill performance metrics for the player. This
    data typically includes information about the player's recent skill usage, success
    rates, and other relevant statistics within a defined time window. The method
    is commonly used in skill tracking systems, performance analysis, and UI displays
    related to character progression. It provides a snapshot of how the player has
    been performing with their skills recently, which can be useful for game mechanics
    such as achievement tracking, performance-based rewards, or player feedback systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceWindow object containing recent skill performance data including
    metrics like success rates, usage frequency, and time-based statistics. The object
    may be empty if no recent performance data exists for the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PerformanceWindow recentPerf = playerSkillProfile->GetRecentPerformance();\n\
      if (!recentPerf.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process recent performance data\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Success Rate: \" << recentPerf.GetSuccessRate() << \"%\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis Example
    code: "PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();\nPerformanceWindow\
      \ window = profile->GetRecentPerformance();\nfloat avgSuccess = window.GetAverageSuccessRate();\n\
      uint32 totalUses = window.GetTotalSkillUses();\n// Use these values for performance\
      \ analysis or UI updates\nif (avgSuccess > 0.8f && totalUses > 10) {\n    //\
      \ Player is performing well with high usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cache recent performance data to improve performance, so
    subsequent calls might return the same data unless new skill activity has occurred.
    The PerformanceWindow object returned should be treated as read-only for consistency
    with TrinityCore's design patterns.
  warnings: The returned PerformanceWindow object may contain stale data if the player's
    skill usage hasn't changed recently. Always check if the window contains valid
    data before processing, especially when using it in conditional logic or UI updates.
