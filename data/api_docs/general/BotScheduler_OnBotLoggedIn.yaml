  class: BotScheduler

  signature: void BotScheduler::OnBotLoggedIn(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot logs into the game world
  description: The OnBotLoggedIn method is invoked when a bot character successfully
    authenticates and enters the game world. This method typically initializes the
    bot's state, sets up necessary data structures, and prepares the bot for gameplay
    activities such as questing, combat, or resource gathering. It may also trigger
    additional systems like AI behavior initialization, faction handling, or integration
    with the TrinityCore core systems to ensure proper bot operation within the game
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character that has logged
      in. This value is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage the bot's
      session and state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom bot manager
    code: "class MyBotManager {\npublic:\n    void HandleBotLogin(int guid) {\n  \
      \      // Call the scheduler's login handler\n        botScheduler.OnBotLoggedIn(guid);\n\
      \        // Additional logic after login\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core game loop or authentication
    subsystem. Developers should ensure that any initialization performed in this
    method does not block the main thread for extended periods to maintain server
    performance.
