  signature: float FollowBehaviorUtils::GetRoleBasedAngle(int role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the angle offset based on the specified role for follow
    behavior in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetRoleBasedAngle method computes a specific angular offset that
    is used by the FollowBehaviorUtils class to determine positioning relative to
    a leader when following. This method takes an integer role parameter which defines
    the follower's position within a group or formation, such as front, rear, left,
    or right. The returned float value represents the angle in radians that should
    be applied for proper positioning during movement or combat behavior. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper group cohesion and tactical positioning in
    player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: "A float value representing the calculated angle offset in radians based\
    \ on the provided role. The exact value depends on predefined role mappings within\
    \ the implementation, typically ranging from 0 to 2\u03C0 radians (0\xB0 to 360\xB0\
    )."
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float angle = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetRoleBasedAngle(1);

      // Returns the angle offset for role 1, typically representing a frontal position'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Roles for Formation
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n{\n    float angle = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetRoleBasedAngle(i);\n\
      \    // Use angle to position followers in a circular formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and relies on internal role-to-angle
    mappings. It should be called during pathfinding or movement updates to ensure
    proper positioning. The implementation may cache results for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the role parameter is within expected bounds (typically 0-3
    for common formations), as invalid values might result in unexpected behavior
    or default angles. This method does not validate input parameters.
