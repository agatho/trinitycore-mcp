documentation:
  brief: Sets the vertex and triangle data for the group model
  description: The setMeshData method assigns vertex and triangle information to a
    GroupModel instance, which is used in the rendering and collision detection systems
    of TrinityCore. This method typically initializes or updates the mesh data that
    defines the geometric structure of a group object in the game world. The parameters
    represent move semantics for vertex and triangle data, suggesting efficient memory
    management through move operations rather than copies. This functionality is crucial
    for dynamic model updates during gameplay, such as when objects change shape or
    are modified by game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: vert
    description: An rvalue reference to an integer representing the vertex data for
      the group model. This parameter likely holds a handle or identifier to vertex
      buffer data.
  - name: tri
    description: An rvalue reference to an integer representing the triangle data
      for the group model. This parameter likely holds a handle or identifier to triangle
      index buffer data.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of setMeshData
    code: 'GroupModel model;

      int vertexData = 1001;

      int triangleData = 2002;

      model.setMeshData(std::move(vertexData), std::move(triangleData));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting mesh data with dynamic values
    code: 'GroupModel* groupModel = new GroupModel();

      int vertexCount = 150;

      int triangleCount = 300;

      // Simulate some processing to get actual vertex/triangle data

      int vertexHandle = vertexCount * 4; // Example calculation

      int triangleHandle = triangleCount * 3; // Example calculation

      model->setMeshData(std::move(vertexHandle), std::move(triangleHandle));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses move semantics for its parameters, indicating that the vertex
    and triangle data are transferred rather than copied. This approach is efficient
    for large datasets but requires that the source data remains valid until after
    the method call completes. The GroupModel class likely manages memory internally
    and expects these handles to reference valid mesh resources in the game's resource
    system.
  warnings: Since this method uses move semantics, ensure that the parameters are
    not used afterward as they will have been moved from. Passing invalid vertex or
    triangle data handles may lead to undefined behavior or rendering errors in the
    game world.
