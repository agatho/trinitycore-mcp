  method: HasOrbit
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::HasOrbit() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger has an orbital path defined.
  description: The HasOrbit method checks if the current area trigger is configured
    to follow an orbital trajectory around a target position or object. This functionality
    is commonly used in game mechanics such as circular spell effects, rotating traps,
    or moving boss abilities where the trigger area needs to orbit around a central
    point. The method returns true if the area trigger has been set up with orbital
    parameters, and false otherwise. This check is typically performed before executing
    orbital movement logic to ensure proper behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the area trigger has an orbital path
    defined. Returns true if the area trigger is configured to orbit, false if it
    does not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Orbit Check
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasOrbit()) {\n    // Execute orbital movement logic\n\
      \    areaTrigger->UpdateOrbit();\n} else {\n    // Handle non-orbital area trigger\n\
      \    areaTrigger->UpdatePosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Orbital Behavior
    code: "void ProcessAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger* trigger) {\n    if (trigger->HasOrbit())\
      \ {\n        // Apply orbital mechanics\n        trigger->ApplyOrbitalMovement();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply standard area trigger behavior\n        trigger->ApplyStaticEffect();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other orbital-related methods
    such as GetOrbitCenter(), GetOrbitRadius(), and UpdateOrbit(). The implementation
    likely checks internal flags or data structures that define the orbital state
    of the area trigger. Performance-wise, this is a fast boolean check and should
    not cause noticeable overhead.
  warnings: Developers should ensure that orbital movement logic is only executed
    when HasOrbit() returns true to prevent undefined behavior. Incorrectly assuming
    an area trigger has orbit parameters can lead to crashes or unexpected movement
    patterns in the game world.
