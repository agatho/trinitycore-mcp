documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking for all fire mage abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the initial state of all fire
    mage spell cooldowns within the FireMageRefactored class. This method is typically
    called during character initialization or when switching to the fire mage specialization.
    It ensures that all fire-based spells start with their correct cooldown timers,
    preventing immediate usage of abilities upon login or spec change. The method
    configures internal cooldown tracking structures and resets any existing cooldown
    states to their default values.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'FireMageRefactored fireMage;

      fireMage.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the mage's initialization phase.
    Repeated calls may reset cooldown states unexpectedly and could lead to inconsistent
    behavior in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat as it may interfere with
    ongoing cooldown tracking and cause unexpected spell behavior.
