    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the current learning phase of a bot based on its GUID
  description: The DetectLearningPhase method analyzes the specified bot's current
    learning state within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates various factors
    such as skill levels, training progress, and experience accumulation to categorize
    the bot into a specific learning phase. This phase classification is crucial for
    determining appropriate training strategies, quest assignments, and skill development
    paths in automated player character management systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a LearningPhase enumeration value indicating the bot's current
    learning stage. Possible values may include BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED,
    or MASTER, representing different levels of proficiency and training completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nLearningPhase phase = analytics.DetectLearningPhase(botGuid);\n\
      if (phase == LearningPhase::ADVANCED)\n{\n    // Execute advanced training routines\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or cache lookups to determine
    the bot's current state. The implementation may involve checking skill points,
    experience points, and completed quests against predefined thresholds to assign
    the appropriate learning phase.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid bot entity
    in the system. Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or return incorrect phase classifications.
