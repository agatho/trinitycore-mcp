  method: ModifyPhasesReferences
  signature: void PhaseShift::ModifyPhasesReferences(int itr, int32 references)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the reference count for a specific phase in the PhaseShift system
  description: The ModifyPhasesReferences method adjusts the reference counter associated
    with a particular phase index within the PhaseShift system. This mechanism is
    used to track how many active objects or players are currently referencing a specific
    phase, enabling efficient phase management and cleanup. The method takes an iterator
    value and a reference count adjustment, allowing for incrementing or decrementing
    of the phase's reference count. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper phase visibility and resource management in World of Warcraft's phased
    content systems.
  parameters:
  - name: itr
    description: The iterator/index identifying which phase to modify within the PhaseShift
      system
  - name: references
    description: The adjustment value to apply to the phase's reference count (positive
      to increment, negative to decrement)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing Phase Reference Count
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      phaseShift.ModifyPhasesReferences(3, 1); // Increment reference count for phase
      at index 3'
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrementing Phase Reference Count
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      phaseShift.ModifyPhasesReferences(5, -2); // Decrement reference count for phase
      at index 5 by 2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage phase visibility and object lifecycle. The reference counting mechanism
    helps determine when a phase can be safely removed from memory or deactivated.
    Ensure that modifications to phase references are properly synchronized in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Incorrect use of this method may lead to phase visibility issues or memory
    leaks. Always ensure that reference counts are balanced (incremented and decremented
    appropriately) to prevent invalid phase states.
