documentation:
  brief: Registers a callback function to be invoked on any group state transition.
  description: The OnAnyTransition method allows developers to register a callback
    function that will be executed whenever the group state machine transitions between
    states. This is useful for implementing logic that should respond to group changes
    such as member joins, leaves, or leadership transfers. The callback receives information
    about the transition and can be used to trigger actions like updating UI elements,
    sending notifications, or modifying group behavior. This method is part of the
    group management system in TrinityCore and integrates with the broader state machine
    architecture for handling group operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void OnGroupTransition(Group* group, Group::State oldState, Group::State\
      \ newState) {\n    // Handle transition logic here\n    printf(\"Group transitioned\
      \ from %d to %d\\n\", oldState, newState);\n}\n\n// Register the callback\n\
      GroupStateMachine::OnAnyTransition(OnGroupTransition);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during group initialization or setup phase.
    The callback function must remain valid for the lifetime of the group state machine
    to avoid dangling pointers. Implementation uses a standard observer pattern where
    multiple callbacks can be registered.
  warnings: Ensure that the callback function does not perform operations that could
    cause deadlocks or modify the state machine during transition processing. Avoid
    calling methods that might recursively trigger state changes from within the callback.
