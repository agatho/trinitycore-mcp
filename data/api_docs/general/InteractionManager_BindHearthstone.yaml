documentation:
  brief: Binds the player's hearthstone to the innkeeper's location
  description: The BindHearthstone method allows a player character to bind their
    hearthstone to the location of an innkeeper NPC. This enables the player to instantly
    teleport back to this location using the hearthstone item. The method performs
    validation checks to ensure the player is within interaction range of the innkeeper
    and that the player has a valid hearthstone in their inventory. It also verifies
    that the innkeeper is a valid innkeeper type that supports hearthstone binding.
    Upon successful binding, the player's hearthstone location is updated to match
    the innkeeper's position.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to bind their hearthstone
  - name: innkeeper
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the innkeeper NPC with
      which the hearthstone should be bound
  returns: InteractionResult indicating the success or failure of the hearthstone
    binding operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_TARGET, or
    OUT_OF_RANGE.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hearthstone Binding
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* innkeeper = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = InteractionManager::BindHearthstone(player, innkeeper);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Hearthstone successfully bound\n    sLog->outString(\"Hearthstone\
      \ bound to innkeeper at %s\", innkeeper->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Hearthstone Binding with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* innkeeper = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = InteractionManager::BindHearthstone(player, innkeeper);\nswitch (result)\
      \ {\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n        sLog->outString(\"Hearthstone\
      \ successfully bound\");\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::INVALID_TARGET:\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Invalid target for hearthstone binding\");\n    \
      \    break;\n    case InteractionResult::OUT_OF_RANGE:\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is out of range of the innkeeper\");\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Hearthstone binding failed\");\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that both the player and the innkeeper are within valid
    interaction range. The method internally checks for proper player state, including
    whether they have a hearthstone item in their inventory. It also validates that
    the creature is an innkeeper type that supports hearthstone binding. Performance-wise,
    this operation is lightweight as it primarily involves data validation and database
    updates.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually interacting
    with an innkeeper NPC. Calling it with invalid parameters or without proper range
    checks may result in unexpected behavior. The method does not perform any visual
    feedback to the player; additional UI updates are typically handled separately
    by the calling code.
