documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundMap instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundMap class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated to the battleground map instance. It ensures
    proper cleanup of game objects, players, and any internal data structures related
    to the specific battleground instance. This method is automatically invoked when
    a BattlegroundMap object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor
    performs necessary cleanup operations such as removing references to players,
    clearing event handlers, and freeing memory used by the battleground's map data.
    It also handles the proper termination of any ongoing battleground activities,
    ensuring no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur during the destruction process.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlegroundMap
    code: "void CleanupBattleground()\n{\n    BattlegroundMap* bgMap = new BattlegroundMap();\n\
      \    // ... use bgMap ...\n    delete bgMap; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Scope-based destruction
    code: "void ProcessBattleground()\n{\n    {\n        BattlegroundMap bgMap;\n\
      \        // ... use bgMap ...\n    } // Destructor automatically called when\
      \ bgMap goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the battleground lifecycle management.
    It should not be called manually unless explicitly deleting an object. The destruction
    process may involve notifying other systems about the battleground's end, so developers
    should avoid calling this method directly in most cases.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it will
    lead to undefined behavior. The destructor handles cleanup of game state and resources,
    so improper handling can cause memory leaks or crashes.
