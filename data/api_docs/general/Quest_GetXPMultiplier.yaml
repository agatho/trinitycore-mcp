  brief: Returns the experience points multiplier for the quest
  description: The GetXPMultiplier method retrieves the experience points multiplier
    value associated with a specific quest. This multiplier is applied to the base
    experience reward when a player completes the quest, affecting how much experience
    they receive. The value is typically set in the quest's database entry and can
    be used to adjust quest difficulty or reward scaling. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the experience points multiplier. A value of
    1.0 indicates normal experience rewards, while values greater than 1.0 increase
    rewards and values less than 1.0 decrease them.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve XP Multiplier for Quest
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (quest)\n{\n  \
      \  float multiplier = quest->GetXPMultiplier();\n    printf(\"Quest XP Multiplier:\
      \ %.2f\\n\", multiplier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses quest data from the database and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical code paths. The returned value is read-only and reflects
    the static configuration of the quest.
