documentation:
  brief: Satisfies the skill requirements for a quest
  description: This method checks if the player meets the skill requirements necessary
    to accept and complete a specific quest. It evaluates whether the player's current
    skill levels are sufficient to satisfy the requirements defined in the quest's
    skill requirement fields. The method returns true if all skill requirements are
    met, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for quest acceptance and completion
    mechanics within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing skill requirements that need
      to be satisfied
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages to the player
      when skill requirements are not met
  returns: Returns true if all skill requirements for the quest are satisfied by the
    player, false otherwise. The method may return false even if the player has sufficient
    skill levels but the quest's skill requirements are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestSkill(quest, true);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Quest can be accepted\n} else {\n    // Quest cannot be accepted due\
      \ to insufficient skill requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest acceptance and completion processes.
    It's important to note that this method does not modify the player's skill levels
    directly, but rather evaluates whether they meet the requirements set by the quest.
  warnings: The method may return false even if the player has sufficient skill levels,
    as it specifically checks against the quest's defined skill requirements. This
    can lead to confusion if players have high skill levels but still cannot accept
    certain quests due to specific skill requirement thresholds.
