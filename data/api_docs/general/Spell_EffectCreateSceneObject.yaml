  brief: Creates a scene object associated with the spell effect.
  description: The EffectCreateSceneObject method is responsible for spawning a scene
    object within the game world as part of a spell's visual or interactive effect.
    This method typically handles the creation and initialization of scene objects
    that are used to display special effects, environmental changes, or other visual
    components tied to spell casting. The method operates within the context of the
    spell's execution and is usually invoked during the spell's effect application
    phase. Scene objects created through this method may be temporary or persistent
    depending on the spell's configuration and the specific requirements of the effect
    being implemented.

  returns: null

    code: "void MySpell::EffectCreateSceneObject()\n{\n    // Create a scene object\
      \ for visual effect\n    if (Unit* target = GetHitUnit())\n    {\n        ScenePackage\
      \ pkg;\n        pkg.SetSceneType(SCENE_TYPE_SPELL_EFFECT);\n        pkg.SetSceneFlags(SCENE_FLAG_NONE);\n\
      \        pkg.SetPosition(target->GetPosition());\n        target->AddSceneObject(&pkg);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during effect
    application. Developers should ensure that scene object creation aligns with the
    spell's intended visual design and does not conflict with existing scene objects.
    The method may interact with the client-side scene manager to properly display
    effects.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to visual artifacts or client-side
    crashes if scene objects are not properly initialized or cleaned up. Ensure that
    all required parameters for scene object creation are valid before calling this
    method.
