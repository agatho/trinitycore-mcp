  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: FindAlternativePosition
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::FindAlternativePosition(Player * bot, const
    int & targetPos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns an alternative position for a bot to move to when
    following a leader.
  description: The FindAlternativePosition method determines a suitable alternative
    location for a bot player to navigate to when the bot is following a leader. This
    method is typically used in AI behavior systems where bots need to maintain formation
    or avoid obstacles while following a designated leader. It evaluates the current
    position of the bot and the target position, then computes a new position that
    ensures proper spacing and pathfinding. The method may consider factors such as
    distance from the leader, terrain, and potential collision avoidance. This function
    is part of the LeaderFollowBehavior class which manages group movement mechanics
    in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to find
      an alternative position. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: targetPos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target position coordinate.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific location in the game world or
      a predefined position index.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated alternative position
    index or coordinate. A positive value indicates a valid alternative position,
    while negative values may indicate failure or invalid input conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in leader-follow behavior
    code: "int alternativePos = leaderFollowBehavior->FindAlternativePosition(botPlayer,\
      \ targetPosition);\nif (alternativePos >= 0)\n{\n    // Move bot to the calculated\
      \ alternative position\n    botPlayer->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0, alternativePos);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using return value for pathfinding
    code: "int result = leaderFollowBehavior->FindAlternativePosition(playerBot, leaderPosition);\n\
      if (result > 0)\n{\n    // Use result as destination for bot's movement\n  \
      \  Position dest;\n    dest.Relocate(result);\n    playerBot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(1,\
      \ dest);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case - no valid alternative position\
      \ found\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to find alternative position for bot %u\"\
      , playerBot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the AI system for maintaining proper
    formation during group movement. The implementation may involve pathfinding algorithms
    and collision detection to ensure bots don't end up in invalid positions or obstruct
    each other. Performance considerations should be taken into account as this method
    might be called frequently during active group movement scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and may produce undefined behavior
    if bot is null or targetPos represents an invalid coordinate. Developers should
    verify that the returned position value is within acceptable bounds before using
    it for actual movement operations.
