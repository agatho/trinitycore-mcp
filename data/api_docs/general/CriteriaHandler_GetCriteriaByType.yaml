  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: GetCriteriaByType
  signature: const CriteriaList & CriteriaHandler::GetCriteriaByType(int type, uint32
    asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria associated with a specific type and asset.
  description: The GetCriteriaByType method fetches a collection of criteria entries
    that match the provided type and asset parameters. This function is typically
    used within the context of achievement tracking and criterion evaluation in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It allows systems to retrieve all relevant
    criteria for a given category and asset identifier, which can then be evaluated
    against player progress or conditions. The returned CriteriaList is a constant
    reference, ensuring that modifications to the underlying data are not possible
    through this interface.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer value representing the type of criteria to retrieve. This
      usually corresponds to predefined criterion types such as quest completion,
      item acquisition, or combat actions.
  - name: asset
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying a specific asset related to
      the criteria. The meaning of this value depends on the criterion type; for example,
      it may represent a quest ID, item ID, or spell ID.
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList container holding all criteria entries
    that match the specified type and asset. If no matching criteria exist, an empty
    list is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve criteria for quest completion
    code: "const CriteriaList& criteria = handler.GetCriteriaByType(CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ 12345);\nfor (const auto& criterion : criteria) {\n    // Process each criterion\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if any criteria exist for a specific spell
    code: "const CriteriaList& criteria = handler.GetCriteriaByType(CRITERIA_TYPE_CAST_SPELL,\
      \ 98765);\nif (!criteria.empty()) {\n    // There are criteria related to casting\
      \ this spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and thread-safe for read operations.
    The CriteriaList returned should not be modified directly as it's a const reference.
    If performance is critical, consider caching results or using the method judiciously.
  warnings: Ensure that the type and asset values passed are valid and correspond
    to actual criteria definitions in the database. Invalid parameters may result
    in an empty list being returned without error.
