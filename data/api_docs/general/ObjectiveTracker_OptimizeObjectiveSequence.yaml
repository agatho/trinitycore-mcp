  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: OptimizeObjectiveSequence
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::OptimizeObjectiveSequence(Player * bot, int &
    priorities)
documentation:
  brief: Reorders objectives in the tracker to optimize the sequence for a bot player
    based on priority values.
  description: The OptimizeObjectiveSequence method adjusts the order of objectives
    within the ObjectiveTracker for a specified bot player, arranging them according
    to given priority values. This optimization ensures that the most important or
    time-sensitive objectives are presented first, improving gameplay efficiency and
    task completion flow. The method modifies the internal sequence of objectives
    in-place without returning a new list. It is typically used during quest progression
    or objective management when dynamic reordering is needed for optimal player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose objectives
      will be reordered. Must not be null.
  - name: priorities
    description: Reference to an integer value that determines the priority order
      for objective sequencing. Higher values indicate higher priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeObjectiveSequence
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player object

      int priorityValue = 5;

      objectiveTracker->OptimizeObjectiveSequence(botPlayer, priorityValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ObjectiveTracker and should
    be called carefully to avoid unintended side effects in objective progression.
    The exact algorithm for reordering is implementation-specific but generally prioritizes
    objectives based on the provided integer value.
