  method: GetMaxCounter
  signature: LowType ObjectGuid::GetMaxCounter() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum counter value for this ObjectGuid.
  description: The GetMaxCounter method retrieves the highest possible counter value
    that can be represented by the ObjectGuid's counter field. In TrinityCore, ObjectGuids
    are structured to include a type identifier, a counter, and a low GUID. The counter
    portion is used to distinguish between different objects of the same type. This
    method returns the maximum value that this counter can hold, which is typically
    used for validation or comparison purposes within the game's object management
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: The maximum counter value (LowType) that can be represented by this ObjectGuid's
    counter field. This value represents the upper limit of the counter portion of
    the GUID and is typically used to determine valid ranges for object identification.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum counter for a player GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      LowType maxCounter = playerGuid.GetMaxCounter();

      // maxCounter will contain the maximum possible counter value for player GUIDs'
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact value returned by GetMaxCounter depends on the specific type of
    ObjectGuid (HighGuid) being used. Different object types may have different counter
    bit widths, which affects the maximum counter value. This method is primarily
    useful for internal game mechanics and validation routines.
