api:
  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: SummonedCreatureDies
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature * summon, Unit
    * killer)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a summoned creature dies, triggering associated AI
    behavior.
  description: The SummonedCreatureDies method is invoked by the SmartGameObjectAI
    framework when a creature that was summoned by this game object is killed. This
    method allows the AI to respond to the death of summoned units, potentially triggering
    quest events, spell effects, or other scripted behaviors. It serves as a callback
    mechanism for managing dynamic summoning logic within the TrinityCore AI system.
    The method receives both the creature that died and the unit responsible for its
    death, enabling contextual responses based on the killer's identity.
  parameters:
  - name: summon
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has died. This represents the
      summoned unit controlled by this SmartGameObjectAI instance.
  - name: killer
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that caused the death of the summoned
      creature. May be nullptr if the death was not caused by a direct attack, or
      if the killer is no longer valid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "void MyGameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature* summon, Unit* killer)\n\
      {\n    // Trigger quest credit if the summoned creature was killed by a player\n\
      \    if (killer && killer->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Perform quest-related actions here\n        // e.g., SendQuestCredit(), etc.\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "void MyGameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature* summon, Unit* killer)\n\
      {\n    // Check if the summoned creature was a specific type\n    if (summon->GetEntry()\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        // Play sound effect or animation\n        // Activate\
      \ another game object\n        // Or reset timer for next summon\n    }\n  \
      \  \n    // Handle different killer types differently\n    if (killer && killer->IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        // Player killed the creature\n        DoSomethingForPlayer(killer);\n\
      \    }\n    else if (killer && killer->IsCreature())\n    {\n        // Creature\
      \ killed the summoned unit\n        DoSomethingForCreature(killer);\n    }\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is typically called from within the SmartAI framework's internal
    event handling system. Developers should ensure that any logic implemented here
    does not cause infinite loops or excessive resource consumption. The method may
    be invoked multiple times during a single game session if multiple creatures are
    summoned and killed.
  warnings: Be cautious when accessing pointers passed to this function, as they may
    become invalid after the creature dies. Ensure proper null checks before dereferencing
    pointers. Also, avoid modifying the AI state in ways that could interfere with
    the normal execution flow of the SmartAI system.
