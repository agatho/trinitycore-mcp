    members)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal formation type for a group based on the
    number of members.
  description: The GetOptimalFormationForGroup method evaluates the size of a group
    and selects the most appropriate combat or movement formation type from the available
    formations. This utility is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to
    optimize group behavior during encounters, such as choosing between tight formations
    for melee groups or spread-out formations for ranged units. The method considers
    factors like group size, member roles, and tactical requirements to return a FormationType
    that enhances group effectiveness. It assumes that the input parameter represents
    a valid group member count and does not perform validation checks on the value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationType enum value indicating the optimal formation for
    the given number of group members. Possible values may include SINGLE, LINE, CIRCLE,
    or other formation types depending on internal logic and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: FormationType optimalFormation = FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForGroup(5);
      // Returns optimal formation for a group of 5 members
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game engine to dynamically adjust
    group formations during combat scenarios. The implementation may be based on hardcoded
    rules or configuration files that define how many members should use which formation.
    Performance is generally not a concern as this is a simple lookup or calculation
    operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the input value represents a valid number of group members
    (typically non-negative integers). While no explicit validation is performed,
    invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect formation selection.
