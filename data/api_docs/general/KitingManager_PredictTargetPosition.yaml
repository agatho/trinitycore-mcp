  class: KitingManager
  method: PredictTargetPosition
  signature: int KitingManager::PredictTargetPosition(Unit * target, float timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of a target unit based on its current movement
    and velocity.
  description: The PredictTargetPosition method calculates where a given Unit will
    be located after a specified time interval, taking into account its current movement
    direction, speed, and any ongoing movement behaviors. This functionality is primarily
    used in AI systems to anticipate enemy positions for targeting or avoidance mechanics.
    The prediction considers the unit's current velocity vector and applies it over
    the timeAhead duration to estimate a future coordinate. It's particularly useful
    for kiting behavior, where an AI needs to determine optimal positioning relative
    to moving targets.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose future position is to be predicted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: The time duration (in seconds) into the future for which to predict
      the target's position. Should be a positive value representing time.
  returns: Returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the prediction
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful prediction, while
    non-zero values may indicate errors such as invalid input parameters or inability
    to compute a valid prediction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for kiting AI
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint result = kitingManager->PredictTargetPosition(target,\
      \ 2.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Prediction successful, proceed with kiting\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using prediction to determine optimal retreat position
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nfloat timeAhead = 3.0f;\nint result =\
      \ kitingManager->PredictTargetPosition(target, timeAhead);\nif (result == 0)\
      \ {\n    // Use predicted position to calculate safe distance and move away\n\
      \    Position predictedPos = kitingManager->GetLastPredictedPosition();\n  \
      \  // Implement retreat logic based on predicted position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on accurate unit movement data. If the target
    is not moving or has no velocity, the prediction will return a static position.
    The accuracy of predictions decreases over longer time intervals due to potential
    changes in movement behavior or external factors like terrain or combat actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also note that this method
    may not account for complex movement patterns such as sudden direction changes
    or acceleration, which could reduce prediction accuracy in dynamic combat situations.
