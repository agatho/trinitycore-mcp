  signature: void SystemMemoryAnalytics::UpdateSystemMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates system memory metrics for analytics purposes.
  description: The UpdateSystemMetrics method collects and updates current system
    memory usage statistics, including total physical memory, available memory, and
    memory utilization percentages. This method is typically invoked periodically
    by the TrinityCore server to monitor system resources and ensure optimal performance.
    It may also trigger alerts or logging when memory thresholds are exceeded, helping
    administrators maintain server stability. The collected data is used for internal
    analytics and can be accessed through other methods in the SystemMemoryAnalytics
    class.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform system calls that could introduce minor performance
    overhead. It is recommended to call this method at appropriate intervals rather
    than continuously. The implementation relies on platform-specific APIs for memory
    retrieval, so behavior may vary between operating systems.
