documentation:
  brief: Processes bot lifecycle management tasks in a dedicated worker thread
  description: The WorkerThreadProc method serves as the main execution entry point
    for the bot lifecycle management worker thread. This method continuously monitors
    and handles various bot-related operations such as creation, destruction, state
    transitions, and resource cleanup. It runs in an infinite loop until the shutdown
    signal is received, ensuring that all bot lifecycle events are processed asynchronously
    without blocking the main game thread. The method coordinates with other components
    of the TrinityCore bot system to maintain proper synchronization and resource
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in thread context
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::instance();

      // This method is typically called internally by the thread management system

      // No direct call needed from external code

      mgr->WorkerThreadProc();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to run in a separate thread and should not be called
    directly from game threads. The implementation assumes proper initialization of
    the bot lifecycle manager before thread execution begins. Thread safety is ensured
    through internal synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from game logic as it's intended for
    internal thread management only. Improper usage may lead to race conditions or
    deadlocks in the bot system.
