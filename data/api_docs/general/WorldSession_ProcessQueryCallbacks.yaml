documentation:
  brief: Processes pending database query callbacks for the session
  description: The ProcessQueryCallbacks method handles execution of deferred database
    queries that were initiated during the current session's processing cycle. This
    method is typically invoked during the session's update loop to ensure that any
    asynchronous database operations complete and their results are properly handled.
    It manages the callback queue for queries such as character data retrieval, account
    information loading, or other database-dependent operations that may have been
    scheduled but not yet executed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session update loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update()\n{\n    // ... other session processing ...\n\
      \    ProcessQueryCallbacks();\n    // ... continue with other operations ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during the session update cycle
    and should not normally be invoked manually. It's designed to handle asynchronous
    database operations without blocking the main game loop, ensuring smooth gameplay
    performance.
