  method: IsValid
  signature: bool OpcodeTable::IsValid(OpcodeServer index) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if the specified server opcode index is within the valid range
    of opcodes.
  description: The IsValid method checks whether a given OpcodeServer index is a valid
    opcode identifier within the current opcode table. This method ensures that the
    provided index corresponds to an actual defined opcode in the server's opcode
    mapping, preventing invalid opcode access attempts. It performs bounds checking
    against the internal opcode table size and returns true if the index is valid,
    false otherwise. This validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity when
    processing network packets or handling opcode-related operations in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided OpcodeServer index represents a valid opcode
    within the table; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "OpcodeTable table;\nOpcodeServer opcode = Opcodes::CMSG_AUTH_SESSION;\n\
      if (table.IsValid(opcode)) {\n    // Proceed with opcode handling\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Valid opcode: \" << opcode << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ opcode\n    std::cerr << \"Invalid opcode: \" << opcode << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Packet Processing
    code: "void HandlePacket(WorldPacket& packet) {\n    OpcodeServer opcode = static_cast<OpcodeServer>(packet.GetOpcode());\n\
      \    if (!sOpcodeTable->IsValid(opcode)) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Received\
      \ invalid opcode: %u\", opcode);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Process valid\
      \ opcode\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple bounds check against the maximum number of
    opcodes defined in the server's opcode table. It does not validate the actual
    opcode data or its associated handler function, only that the index is within
    the valid range. The method is typically used before attempting to access or process
    an opcode to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
  warnings: Using an invalid opcode index with this method can lead to undefined behavior
    if the index is not properly validated before being used in other opcode-related
    operations. Always ensure that the opcode index has been validated using IsValid()
    before performing any operations on it.
