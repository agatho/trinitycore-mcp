  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string WaypointMovementGenerator::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the waypoint movement generator's current
    state and configuration.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides a formatted string containing diagnostic
    details about the WaypointMovementGenerator instance. This includes information
    such as the current waypoint index, target position, movement speed, and other
    internal state variables that are useful for debugging pathfinding behavior in
    AI-controlled creatures. The returned string is typically used by developers or
    administrators to inspect the movement state of NPCs during runtime without requiring
    direct memory access or complex debugging sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information including current
    waypoint index, target coordinates, movement speed, and internal state variables
    that describe the generator's current configuration and execution status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = ...;

      std::string debugInfo = wpGen->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("ai", "Waypoint movement state: %s", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging purposes and should not be
    called frequently in performance-critical code paths. The output format may vary
    between different TrinityCore versions or configurations, but generally follows
    a consistent pattern of key-value pairs.
  warnings: The returned string contains potentially sensitive internal state information
    that could reveal details about NPC behavior patterns. Avoid logging this information
    in production environments without proper sanitization.
