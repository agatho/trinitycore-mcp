  method: IsDarkTransformationActive
  signature: bool UnholyPetTracker::IsDarkTransformationActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the dark transformation ability is currently active on the unholy
    pet.
  description: The IsDarkTransformationActive method determines whether the dark transformation
    buff, typically associated with unholy death knights' pets in World of Warcraft,
    is currently active. This method is used internally by the game engine to manage
    pet behavior and abilities. The check considers all relevant buffs and debuffs
    that might affect the pet's transformation state. This functionality is crucial
    for proper spell handling and pet AI logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the dark transformation buff is currently active on the
    pet, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (petTracker->IsDarkTransformationActive()) {\n    // Pet is in dark\
      \ transformation state\n    // Apply appropriate logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "Unit* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet && pet->ToCreature()) {\n    UnholyPetTracker*\
      \ tracker = pet->ToCreature()->GetUnholyPetTracker();\n    if (tracker && tracker->IsDarkTransformationActive())\
      \ {\n        // Cast a spell that only works when pet is transformed\n     \
      \   pet->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DARK_TRANSFORMATION_BUFF, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of the pet's transformation state.
    It should be called only when the pet object is valid and has an associated UnholyPetTracker.
    The method does not perform any direct database or network calls, making it efficient
    for frequent checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet tracker is properly initialized before calling this
    method. Calling this on a null or uninitialized tracker may result in undefined
    behavior. This method should not be used to determine spell availability directly
    without checking if the pet exists and is valid.
