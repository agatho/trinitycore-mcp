  class: InterruptManager
  method: CalculateInterruptEffectiveness
  signature: float InterruptManager::CalculateInterruptEffectiveness(const InterruptCapability
    & capability, const InterruptTarget & target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the effectiveness of an interrupt ability based on capability
    and target parameters.
  description: The CalculateInterruptEffectiveness method determines how effective
    a given interrupt capability is against a specific target. This calculation takes
    into account various factors such as the caster's level, the target's resistance,
    spell power, and other relevant game mechanics. The result is a normalized float
    value typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 represents a perfect interrupt
    chance and 0.0 indicates no chance of interrupting the target. This method is
    used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine whether an interrupt
    attempt succeeds during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: capability
    description: The interrupt capability data structure containing information about
      the interrupting ability such as caster level, spell power, and interrupt chance
      modifiers.
  - name: target
    description: The target data structure containing information about the unit being
      interrupted including their level, resistance values, and other relevant combat
      stats.
  returns: A float value representing the effectiveness of the interrupt attempt.
    Values typically range from 0.0 (no chance) to 1.0 (guaranteed interrupt). The
    exact calculation may involve various modifiers based on game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt effectiveness calculation
    code: 'InterruptCapability cap;

      cap.casterLevel = 80;

      cap.spellPower = 5000;

      InterruptTarget target;

      target.targetLevel = 80;

      target.resistance = 200;

      float effectiveness = interruptManager.CalculateInterruptEffectiveness(cap,
      target);

      // Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating interrupt chance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat system and may be called frequently
    during combat processing. The calculation considers multiple factors including
    level differentials, resistance values, and spell modifiers. Developers should
    ensure that capability and target data are properly initialized before calling
    this method.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing uninitialized or invalid
    capability/target structures may lead to unpredictable results. This method is
    not thread-safe and should be called from the main game thread during combat processing.
