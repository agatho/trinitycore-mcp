  method: WillHitPosition
  signature: bool ProjectileInfo::WillHitPosition(const int & pos, float tolerance)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a projectile will hit a specified position within a given
    tolerance.
  description: The WillHitPosition method evaluates if a projectile, based on its
    current trajectory and properties, will intersect with a target position. It takes
    into account the projectile's path, speed, and the provided tolerance to determine
    if the hit is considered successful. This method is typically used in spell and
    ability systems to check if a projectile will reach its intended target location.
    The method returns true if the projectile's predicted path intersects the specified
    position within the defined tolerance, otherwise false. It is commonly used for
    hit validation, collision detection, and determining whether an attack or spell
    should connect with its target.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The target position to check against the projectile's path. This
      parameter represents a coordinate in the game world that the projectile is evaluated
      against.
  - name: tolerance
    description: The acceptable deviation from the exact hit position, used for determining
      if the projectile 'hits' the target. A higher tolerance allows for more lenient
      hit detection, while a lower tolerance requires more precise targeting.
  returns: Returns true if the projectile's predicted trajectory intersects with the
    specified position within the defined tolerance; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (projectile->WillHitPosition(targetPosition, 1.0f)) {\n    // Projectile\
      \ will hit target\n    SendHitEffect();\n} else {\n    // Projectile misses\
      \ target\n    SendMissEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Tolerance
    code: "float tolerance = CalculateToleranceBasedOnSpellPower(spell);\nif (projectile->WillHitPosition(targetPosition,\
      \ tolerance)) {\n    // Apply damage and effects\n    ApplyDamage(target);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle miss case\n    HandleMiss();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell casting or projectile launch to
    pre-validate whether a projectile will hit its target. The tolerance parameter
    allows for some variance in targeting, which can be useful for balancing gameplay
    mechanics and ensuring that players don't feel overly penalized by minor positioning
    errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the position passed to this method is valid and within the
    game world bounds. Using invalid positions may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    hit detection results.
