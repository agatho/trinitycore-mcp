  class: QuestRelationResult
  method: QuestRelationResult
  signature: void QuestRelationResult::QuestRelationResult(int range, bool onlyActive)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestRelationResult object with specified range and active
    quest filtering.
  description: The QuestRelationResult constructor initializes a quest relation result
    object that manages how quests are related to a player or NPC within a given range.
    It allows filtering of quests based on whether they are active or not, which is
    essential for determining available quest options in World of Warcraft's quest
    system. This method sets up internal state for quest relations and prepares the
    object for subsequent operations like retrieving or updating quest data.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) within which quests should be considered.
      Quests beyond this range will not be included in the result set.
  - name: onlyActive
    description: When true, only active quests are included in the result; when false,
      all applicable quests (including completed or available) may be returned based
      on other criteria.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize QuestRelationResult with range 100 yards and active quests only
    code: QuestRelationResult result(100, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize QuestRelationResult for nearby quests including inactive ones
    code: QuestRelationResult result(50, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore quest system
    to manage quest availability within specific ranges. It's important to note that
    the range parameter affects performance as larger ranges may require more database
    queries or processing.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the range value can lead to quests not being properly
    filtered, potentially causing players to see unavailable quests or miss valid
    ones. Using a very large range might impact server performance due to increased
    data processing.
