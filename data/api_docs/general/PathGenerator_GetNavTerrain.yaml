documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the navigation terrain type at the specified world coordinates.
  description: The GetNavTerrain method determines the terrain type (such as ground,
    water, or obstacle) at a given set of world coordinates. This is used internally
    by the pathfinding system to evaluate whether a particular location is navigable.
    The method takes into account the current map and zone data to return an appropriate
    terrain identifier that can be used for path generation and movement logic. It's
    commonly called during path calculation to ensure characters do not attempt to
    move through invalid terrain such as water or solid obstacles.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'An integer representing the terrain type at the specified coordinates.
    Possible values include: 0 for normal ground, 1 for water, 2 for obstacle, and
    other values may represent special terrain types like climbable surfaces or non-walkable
    areas depending on the implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check terrain type
    code: "float x = 100.0f;\nfloat y = 200.0f;\nfloat z = 50.0f;\nint terrainType\
      \ = pathGenerator.GetNavTerrain(x, y, z);\nif (terrainType == 0) {\n    // Normal\
      \ ground\n    printf(\"Terrain is walkable\\n\");\n} else if (terrainType ==\
      \ 1) {\n    // Water\n    printf(\"Terrain is water - cannot walk\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh and map data to determine
    terrain types. It should only be called when valid world coordinates are provided,
    as invalid coordinates may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
    The returned integer value corresponds to predefined constants used throughout
    TrinityCore's pathfinding system.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or out-of-bounds coordinates, as
    it may lead to crashes or incorrect terrain evaluation. Ensure that the map and
    zone data are properly initialized before calling this function for accurate results.
