  method: InitializeActions
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::InitializeActions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the leader follow behavior actions for a creature or unit in
    the World of Warcraft TrinityCore server.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures the action handlers
    and behaviors that govern how a unit follows its leader within the game's AI system.
    This method is typically called during the initialization phase of an AI behavior
    tree, establishing the necessary action nodes and conditions required for the
    unit to properly execute leader-following logic. It ensures that the unit's AI
    is capable of responding to leader movement, maintaining formation, and handling
    various follower states such as idle, moving, or engaged in combat while staying
    within a defined distance from the leader. The method prepares the internal state
    machine and action queues needed for dynamic behavior adjustment based on environmental
    conditions and leader commands.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      behavior.InitializeActions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI initialization phase.
    It typically sets up internal action handlers and registers callbacks for movement
    and state change events. The method assumes that the unit has a valid leader reference
    and that the AI system is properly initialized before execution.
