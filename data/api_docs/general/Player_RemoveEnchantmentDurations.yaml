    item, effectively clearing any temporary enchantment effects that are currently
    applied to the item. It is typically used during player logout, item destruction,
    or when enchantments need to be removed for gameplay reasons. The method ensures
    that enchantment effects are properly cleared without affecting permanent enchantment
    properties.

      be removed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:

      if (item)\n{\n    player->RemoveEnchantmentDurations(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when items
    are removed from player inventory or during logout. It may also be invoked manually
    when removing enchantments for gameplay purposes such as item destruction or when
    resetting enchantment effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect enchantment removal,
    potentially causing items to lose their enchantment properties unexpectedly. Ensure
    that the item pointer is valid before calling this method.
