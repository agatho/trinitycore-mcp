documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a paladin's current spell cast when triggered by the AI.
  description: The ExecutePaladinInterrupt method is responsible for handling the
    interruption of a paladin's ongoing spell cast within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    This method typically gets invoked when an external event or condition requires
    the paladin to stop casting their current spell, such as when taking damage, being
    interrupted by an enemy, or when the AI determines that continuing the cast is
    no longer optimal. It ensures proper cleanup and state management for the interrupted
    spell, allowing the paladin to resume normal behavior or initiate a new action.
    The method operates within the context of a BotAI instance and targets a specific
    Unit object, using the spell ID to determine which spell was interrupted.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the paladin's behavior. This
      is used to access AI-related data and control flow logic.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is the target of the spell being
      interrupted. Can be nullptr if no specific target exists.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that was interrupted. Used to
      determine the type and behavior of the interruption.
  returns: Returns an ActionResult indicating whether the interruption was successful
    or not. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: ActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecutePaladinInterrupt(ai, target,
      12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling interruption result
    code: "ActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecutePaladinInterrupt(ai, target,\
      \ 12345);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful\
      \ interruption\n    ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::CAST_SPELL);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle failure\n    ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::FLEE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already determined that a spell interruption
    is necessary. It does not perform checks for whether the spell is actually interruptible
    or if the conditions are met; those should be handled before calling this method.
    The method may also depend on internal state tracking of the paladin's current
    spell cast.
  warnings: Ensure that the target and ai parameters are valid pointers to avoid undefined
    behavior. Calling this method without proper preconditions may lead to inconsistent
    AI behavior or crashes. Also, make sure that the spellId corresponds to a valid
    spell that can be interrupted.
