documentation:
  brief: Initializes default pet quality settings for battle pets within the BattlePetMgr
    system.
  description: The LoadDefaultPetQualities method is responsible for setting up and
    initializing the default quality levels and attributes for battle pets managed
    by the BattlePetMgr class. This method typically populates internal data structures
    with predefined values that define how pet qualities such as rarity, level, and
    stat modifiers are handled within the game's battle pet system. It ensures that
    all newly created or loaded battle pets have consistent baseline characteristics
    before any custom modifications or random generation occurs. The method is generally
    invoked during system initialization or when resetting pet configurations to their
    default state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Initialization
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->LoadDefaultPetQualities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the manager's initialization
    phase to avoid overwriting existing configurations. It is typically not thread-safe
    and should be executed in a single-threaded context, such as during server startup
    or configuration loading.
  warnings: Calling this method after battle pets have already been created or modified
    may result in inconsistent behavior or loss of custom pet data. Ensure that no
    active pet instances exist before invoking this method.
