  brief: Determines whether the player is in the same raid group as another player.
  description: This method checks if the current player and the specified player are
    members of the same raid group. It returns true if both players are in the same
    raid instance, regardless of whether they are in the same party or not. The method
    is commonly used for checking player relationships in raid content, such as determining
    if players can share loot or if they should be able to interact with each other
    in certain scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both players are members of the same raid group, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsInSameRaidWith(targetPlayer)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal raid group structure of TrinityCore. It
    does not consider party membership, only raid membership. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with other player relationship checks for determining whether
    players can interact or share loot.
