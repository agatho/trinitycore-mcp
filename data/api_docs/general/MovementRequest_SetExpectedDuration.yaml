  class: MovementRequest
  method: SetExpectedDuration
  signature: MovementRequest & MovementRequest::SetExpectedDuration(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the expected duration for a movement request in milliseconds.
  description: The SetExpectedDuration method configures the anticipated time duration
    for a movement request, measured in milliseconds. This value is used by the movement
    system to calculate and manage pathfinding behavior, including interpolation timing
    and animation synchronization. The method returns a reference to the current MovementRequest
    object, enabling method chaining. This functionality is particularly relevant
    in scenarios involving scripted movements, AI pathing, or player-controlled movement
    with specific timing requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current MovementRequest object, allowing for method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.SetExpectedDuration(2000); // Set duration to 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.SetExpectedDuration(3000)\n    .SetSpeed(5.0f)\n\
      \    .SetDestination(Position(100, 200, 300));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate the duration value; it's up to the caller to
    ensure reasonable values are provided. The expected duration may be overridden
    or adjusted by internal movement logic during execution.
