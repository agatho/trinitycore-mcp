  class: ChatHandler
  method: ParseCommands
  signature: bool ChatHandler::ParseCommands(int text)
documentation:
  brief: Parses and executes chat commands entered by players in the game.
  description: The ParseCommands method processes incoming chat messages from players,
    identifying valid command syntax and executing the corresponding actions. It handles
    both built-in TrinityCore admin commands and custom player-defined commands. The
    method checks for proper command formatting, validates permissions, and routes
    the command to the appropriate handler function. This method is typically called
    internally by the game server when a chat message is received from a client.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: The raw text input from the player's chat message that needs to be
      parsed for commands.
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully recognized and executed, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an invalid command syntax or a
    command that failed during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Parsing
    code: "if (handler.ParseCommands(\"/go 12345\")) {\n    // Command executed successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // Invalid command or execution failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Command Parsing with Error Handling
    code: "std::string input = \"/summon player_name\";\nif (!handler.ParseCommands(input))\
      \ {\n    handler.PSendSysMessage(\"Unknown command: %s\", input.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core chat handling system and should not be called
    directly from outside the chat subsystem. It relies on internal command registration
    mechanisms and requires proper initialization of the ChatHandler instance before
    use.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input text has already been sanitized and
    validated for basic formatting. Calling this method with malformed commands may
    lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if not properly handled by the calling
    code.
