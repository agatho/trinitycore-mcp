  brief: Performs circular kiting movement pattern for the player
  description: The ExecuteCircularKiting method implements a circular kiting behavior
    for the player character, typically used in combat scenarios to maintain optimal
    distance from enemies while dealing damage. This method calculates and executes
    a circular movement path around the target enemy, adjusting speed and direction
    based on the current KitingContext parameters. The implementation considers factors
    such as target distance, movement speed, and combat state to determine the appropriate
    kiting pattern. It is designed to be called during active combat situations where
    maintaining distance from enemies is crucial for survival or optimal damage output.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a KitingResult enum value indicating the success status of the
    kiting operation. Possible values include KITING_SUCCESS, KITING_FAILED, or KITING_INTERRUPTED
    depending on whether the movement was completed successfully, encountered an error,
    or was interrupted by external factors such as combat interruption or movement
    blockers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic circular kiting execution
    code: "KitingContext context;\ncontext.target = unit;\ncontext.radius = 5.0f;\n\
      context.speed = 3.0f;\nKitingResult result = kitingManager.ExecuteCircularKiting(context);\n\
      if (result == KITING_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Movement completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player character is in a valid combat state
    and that the target unit exists and is within acceptable range. The implementation
    may adjust movement parameters dynamically based on environmental factors such
    as terrain or obstacles. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent
    calls during high-frequency combat situations to prevent excessive CPU usage.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the KitingContext
    can lead to undefined behavior or failed kiting attempts. The method does not
    handle all edge cases such as sudden target removal or extreme environmental changes,
    which may cause movement interruption or failure.
