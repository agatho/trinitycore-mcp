  method: UpdateCombatPhase
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateCombatPhase(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current combat phase state based on elapsed time and AI logic.
  description: The UpdateCombatPhase method is responsible for managing and transitioning
    between different combat states within the CombatAIIntegrator class. It processes
    the time delta (diff) to determine when to trigger phase changes, update AI behavior,
    or modify combat-related flags. This method typically integrates with the core
    game loop to ensure that AI actions are synchronized with real-time combat events.
    The implementation likely evaluates conditions such as target health, distance,
    threat levels, and cooldowns to decide the appropriate combat phase (e.g., melee,
    ranged, spellcasting).

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all combat AI integrators\n\
      \    for (auto& ai : combatAIIntegrators)\n    {\n        ai->UpdateCombatPhase(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the game's update loop to maintain
    accurate AI behavior. It is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, ensuring
    that combat transitions occur smoothly without causing performance degradation.
