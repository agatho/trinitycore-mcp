  class: ManaSoulShardResourceDestro
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ManaSoulShardResourceDestro::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mana soul shard resource destruction system for a player
    bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and configurations
    required for managing mana soul shards within the context of a player bot. This
    includes initializing resource tracking, setting up event handlers, and preparing
    the system to handle mana soul shard related actions such as consumption or generation.
    The method ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and
    configured before the bot begins interacting with mana soul shards. It is typically
    called during the bot's initialization phase or when transitioning into a state
    where mana soul shard management becomes relevant.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      the mana soul shard resource destruction system. Must be a valid player instance
      with appropriate permissions and initialized game state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot instance

      ManaSoulShardResourceDestro resourceSystem;

      resourceSystem.Initialize(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance to avoid potential
    memory leaks or inconsistent state. The system assumes that the provided Player
    object is already initialized and has valid session data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is not null and represents
    a fully initialized player object before calling this method.
