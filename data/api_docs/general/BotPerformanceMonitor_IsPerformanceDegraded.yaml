  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsPerformanceDegraded() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the performance of bot operations has degraded below acceptable
    thresholds.
  description: The IsPerformanceDegraded method evaluates the current performance
    state of bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. It checks various
    metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times to determine
    if the system is operating under degraded conditions that may affect bot behavior
    or overall server stability. This method is typically used by the bot management
    system to dynamically adjust bot behavior or disable certain features when performance
    thresholds are exceeded. The evaluation considers both immediate and historical
    performance data to provide a stable assessment of system health.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the performance of bot operations is considered degraded,
    indicating that the system may be under stress or operating outside of optimal
    parameters. Returns false if performance is within acceptable thresholds and no
    degradation is detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Check
    code: "if (botMonitor.IsPerformanceDegraded()) {\n    // Reduce bot activity or\
      \ disable certain features\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"performance\", \"Bot performance\
      \ degraded, reducing activity\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance-Based Bot Behavior Adjustment
    code: "if (botMonitor.IsPerformanceDegraded()) {\n    // Disable AI-intensive\
      \ bot features\n    for (auto& bot : botList) {\n        bot->SetAIType(BotAI::NONE);\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Re-enable full AI functionality\n    for (auto& bot\
      \ : botList) {\n        bot->SetAIType(BotAI::DEFAULT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations using rolling averages
    or sliding window techniques to assess performance trends rather than just instantaneous
    measurements. The thresholds for what constitutes 'degraded' performance are configurable
    and may vary based on server load, bot count, and system resources. This method
    should be called periodically rather than continuously to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently without proper throttling can introduce
    unnecessary performance overhead. The results may be cached or averaged over time,
    so immediate changes in system state might not be reflected immediately. Developers
    should not rely solely on this check for critical operations and should implement
    fallback mechanisms.
