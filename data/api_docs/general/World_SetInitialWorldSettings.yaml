  class: World
  method: SetInitialWorldSettings
  signature: bool World::SetInitialWorldSettings()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes core world settings and configurations for the TrinityCore server
    instance.
  description: The SetInitialWorldSettings method configures essential game world
    parameters required for proper operation of the TrinityCore server. This includes
    setting up default server options, initializing configuration values, configuring
    game mechanics such as player limits, enabling/disabling features, and preparing
    internal data structures needed for world management. The method typically runs
    during server startup to ensure all necessary settings are applied before the
    world begins accepting connections or processing game events. It performs validation
    checks on critical configurations and returns a success status indicating whether
    all initial settings were properly applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all initial world settings were successfully configured
    and applied, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate configuration
    errors, missing required parameters, or failure to initialize internal systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "World* world = World::instance();\nbool success = world->SetInitialWorldSettings();\n\
      if (!success) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize world settings\"\
      );\n    // Handle initialization failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup, typically before
    the main game loop begins. It's designed to be idempotent but calling it multiple
    times may have unintended side effects. The method internally relies on configuration
    files and database settings, so proper initialization of these components is required
    beforehand.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the world has started processing game events
    or accepting players, as it may cause inconsistent state or system instability.
    Ensure all required configuration files are properly loaded before invoking this
    method.
