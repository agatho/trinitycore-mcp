  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetSeasonalityFactor
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::GetSeasonalityFactor(uint32 itemId, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the seasonality factor for a specific item at a given
    timestamp.
  description: The GetSeasonalityFactor method computes a float value representing
    how seasonal demand or availability affects a particular item in the game's economy.
    This factor is used to adjust item pricing, availability, or market dynamics based
    on time-based events such as holidays, seasonal changes, or recurring in-game
    occurrences. The method takes an item ID and a timestamp to determine the appropriate
    seasonal influence. It may return values outside the typical 0.0-1.0 range depending
    on implementation details, indicating strong seasonal effects or anomalies.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to calculate the seasonality
      factor. Must be a valid item entry in the game database.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the seasonality should be evaluated.
      Used to determine if seasonal events are active or relevant.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the seasonality factor for the specified
    item at the given time. Values typically range from 0.0 (no seasonality effect)
    to 1.0 (full seasonal impact), but may exceed these bounds in certain cases to
    indicate strong seasonal influences or special events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float factor = marketAnalysis.GetSeasonalityFactor(12345, time(nullptr));

      // Returns the current seasonality factor for item ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Item Price Based on Seasonality
    code: 'uint32 itemId = 67890;

      uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);

      float seasonFactor = marketAnalysis.GetSeasonalityFactor(itemId, currentTime);

      float basePrice = GetItemBasePrice(itemId);

      float adjustedPrice = basePrice * seasonFactor;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game event tracking and calendar systems
    to determine seasonal relevance. It may cache results for performance or query
    external data sources like the game's event system. The exact calculation logic
    is not visible in the provided source code.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId passed is valid and exists in the database; invalid
    IDs might cause undefined behavior or return unexpected values. Timestamps should
    be valid Unix timestamps, and using future dates may yield different results than
    expected depending on how seasonal events are programmed.
