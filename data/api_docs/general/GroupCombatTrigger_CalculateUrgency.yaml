documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the urgency level for group combat actions based on
    AI context.
  description: The CalculateUrgency method evaluates the current state of the bot's
    group combat situation to determine how urgently certain actions should be taken.
    This method is typically used by the BotAI system to prioritize combat decisions,
    such as whether to engage enemies, retreat, or call for help. It analyzes factors
    like health status, enemy proximity, and group coordination to return a float
    value representing the urgency level. The returned value generally ranges from
    0.0 (no urgency) to 1.0 (maximum urgency), though specific implementation details
    may vary based on the bot's configuration and current combat context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the urgency level for group
    combat actions. A value of 0.0 means no urgency, while 1.0 indicates maximum urgency.
    Values in between represent varying degrees of urgency that influence decision-making
    within the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float urgency = groupCombatTrigger.CalculateUrgency(ai);\nif (urgency >\
      \ 0.7f) {\n    // Execute high-priority combat action\n    ai->ExecuteCombatAction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateCombatLogic() {\n    GroupCombatTrigger trigger;\n  \
      \  float urgency = trigger.CalculateUrgency(this);\n    \n    if (urgency >=\
      \ 0.9f) {\n        // Immediate action required\n        PerformEmergencyHeal();\n\
      \    } else if (urgency >= 0.5f) {\n        // Moderate urgency - prepare for\
      \ action\n        PrepareForEngagement();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat updates and
    should not perform heavy computations to avoid performance issues. The urgency
    calculation may depend on various dynamic factors such as player health, enemy
    positions, and group composition. It's recommended that this method be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: The method assumes that the BotAI parameter is valid and properly initialized.
    Calling this method without a valid AI context may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect urgency calculations. The returned value should not be used directly
    for critical decisions without additional validation.
