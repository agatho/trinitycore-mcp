  method: SummonedCreatureDies
  signature: void GameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature * param0, Unit * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a summoned creature dies within the GameObjectAI's
    control.
  description: 'The SummonedCreatureDies method is invoked by the GameObjectAI framework
    when a creature that was summoned by this game object has died. This method allows
    custom AI logic to be executed in response to the death of a summoned unit, such
    as triggering additional effects, resetting timers, or managing summoning states.
    It is part of the GameObject''s AI lifecycle management and provides an opportunity
    for developers to implement specific behaviors tied to summoned creature deaths.
    The method receives two parameters: the creature that died and the unit responsible
    for its death, which can be used to determine the cause of death and react accordingly.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has died. This represents the
      summoned creature controlled by this GameObjectAI.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that caused the death of the summoned
      creature. This could be a player, NPC, or any other unit capable of dealing
      damage.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is typically called from internal TrinityCore AI systems when
    a summoned creature's health reaches zero. It should not be invoked directly by
    custom code unless implementing a custom summoning system. The parameters passed
    are guaranteed to be valid pointers, but developers should always check for null
    values in case of unexpected conditions.
  warnings: Do not modify the state of the summoned creature or killer after this
    method is called, as they may already have been removed from memory. Avoid performing
    heavy operations inside this method, as it's executed frequently during combat
    scenarios and can impact performance if not optimized.
