  class: TargetManager
  method: ~TargetManager
  signature: void TargetManager::~TargetManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the TargetManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~TargetManager destructor is automatically invoked when a TargetManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, removes references to target entities,
    and performs necessary deinitialization tasks. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and combat systems, this destructor plays a critical role in preventing memory
    leaks and maintaining system stability when units or creatures are removed from
    the game world. The destruction process typically involves clearing internal target
    lists, notifying subsystems of target removal, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain in the system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    TargetManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'TargetManager* manager = new TargetManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing explicit
    memory management. The TargetManager class likely maintains internal data structures
    that require proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks or undefined behavior.
