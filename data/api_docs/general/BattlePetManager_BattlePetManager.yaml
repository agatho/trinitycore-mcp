  method: BattlePetManager
  signature: void BattlePetManager::BattlePetManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BattlePetManager instance with default settings and empty
    pet collections.
  description: The BattlePetManager constructor initializes the internal state of
    the battle pet manager. This includes setting up default configurations, initializing
    empty collections for active battle pets, and preparing necessary data structures
    for managing player-owned battle pets within the World of Warcraft environment.
    The method ensures that all required member variables are properly initialized
    before any battle pet operations can be performed. It does not perform any external
    API calls or database interactions during initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a BattlePetManager instance
    code: 'BattlePetManager* manager = new BattlePetManager();

      // The manager is now ready to manage battle pets

      // for a player or creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new BattlePetManager
    object. It does not initialize any specific player context or pet data - that
    must be done separately through other methods. The manager will maintain its own
    internal state and should be properly disposed of when no longer needed.
