api:
  class: Battleground
  method: SetClientInstanceID
  signature: void Battleground::SetClientInstanceID(int InstanceID)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the client instance ID for the battleground, linking it to a specific
    instance.
  description: The SetClientInstanceID method assigns a unique instance identifier
    to a battleground, which is used by the client to properly display and manage
    the battleground's instance. This ID is crucial for synchronizing player data,
    handling multiple simultaneous battleground instances, and ensuring that players
    are correctly placed within their respective battleground environments. The method
    typically gets called during battleground initialization or when a new instance
    is created. It's important to note that this method does not validate the InstanceID
    parameter; it simply assigns the provided value.
  parameters:
  - name: InstanceID
    description: The unique identifier for the battleground instance. This value should
      be a positive integer representing the specific instance of the battleground
      being set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Instance ID During Battleground Creation
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new Battleground();

      bg->SetClientInstanceID(12345);

      // The battleground now has instance ID 12345 assigned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Instance ID for Existing Battleground
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(54321);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetClientInstanceID(98765);\n}\n// Updates the existing battleground's\
      \ instance ID to 98765"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal member variable of the Battleground
    class. It should only be called when the battleground is in a state where it can
    safely accept an instance ID assignment. The instance ID must be unique across
    all active battleground instances to prevent conflicts.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or duplicate InstanceID may cause
    synchronization issues between client and server, potentially leading to players
    being unable to enter or properly interact with the battleground. Ensure that
    the InstanceID is valid and unique before calling this method.
