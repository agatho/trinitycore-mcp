documentation:
  brief: Closes the database connection for player bot data operations.
  description: The Close method terminates the active database connection used by
    the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection class. This method ensures that all pending transactions
    are committed or rolled back, and releases any system resources associated with
    the database connection. It is typically called when shutting down player bot
    functionality or when switching between different database configurations. The
    method does not take any parameters and returns no value. After calling Close,
    the connection object should not be used until a new connection is established
    via an appropriate initialization method.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotDatabaseConnection* db = new PlayerbotDatabaseConnection();

      // ... perform database operations ...

      db->Close();

      delete db;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
    object to ensure proper cleanup of database resources. It is recommended to check
    if the connection is already closed before calling Close to avoid potential errors
    or undefined behavior.
