documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reagent cost for the specified class's equipment
  description: The GetClassReagents method retrieves the total reagent cost associated
    with a specific class's equipment requirements. This method is typically used
    in the context of crafting, spell casting, or equipment management within the
    TrinityCore framework. It likely accesses internal data structures that map class
    identifiers to their respective reagent costs, which are essential for determining
    whether a player has sufficient resources to perform certain actions involving
    class-specific gear or abilities. The method assumes valid class IDs and may return
    an error code or default value if an invalid ID is provided.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total reagent cost for the specified
    class's equipment. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid class ID,
    while zero typically means no reagents are required for that class.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve reagent cost for Warrior class
    code: "EquipmentManager* eqMgr = player->GetEquipmentManager();\nint reagentCost\
      \ = eqMgr->GetClassReagents(CLASS_WARRIOR);\nif (reagentCost >= 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with crafting or spell casting\n    printf(\"Warrior reagent cost:\
      \ %d\\n\", reagentCost);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"\
      Invalid class ID or error occurred\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal caching or database lookups for class-specific
    reagent data. It should be called only when valid class identifiers are available
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId parameter is validated before calling this method,
    as invalid IDs may lead to incorrect results or crashes. The return value of -1
    or other negative numbers typically indicates an error condition and should be
    handled appropriately.
