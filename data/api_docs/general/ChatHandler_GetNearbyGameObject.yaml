  class: ChatHandler
  method: GetNearbyGameObject
  signature: GameObject * ChatHandler::GetNearbyGameObject()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the nearest game object within the player's interaction range.
  description: The GetNearbyGameObject method returns a pointer to the closest GameObject
    that is within the player's current interaction distance. This method is typically
    used in game master commands or scripting contexts where the player needs to interact
    with nearby objects. The returned GameObject pointer may be null if no valid game
    object exists within range, or if the player's current context does not support
    object detection. The method relies on the internal state of the ChatHandler instance
    and assumes that the handler has been properly initialized with a valid player
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject instance that is nearest to the player within
    interaction range, or nullptr if no such object exists or if the operation fails
    due to invalid context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a GM command
    code: "void HandleNearbyObjectCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    GameObject*\
      \ go = handler->GetNearbyGameObject();\n    if (go)\n    {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Nearest game object: %s\", go->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        handler->SendSysMessage(\"No nearby game objects found.\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a search within the player's current map and interaction
    range. It may be affected by performance considerations if many GameObjects exist
    in close proximity. The method should only be called when the ChatHandler has
    an active player context.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid player context or outside of an appropriate
    command handler may result in undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences.
    Always check for nullptr return values before using the returned GameObject pointer.
