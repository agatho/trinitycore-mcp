  signature: bool WarlockAI::HasHealthstone()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the warlock has a healthstone available in its inventory.
  description: The HasHealthstone method determines whether the WarlockAI instance
    currently possesses a healthstone item in its inventory. This functionality is
    crucial for warlock AI behavior, particularly when deciding whether to use a healthstone
    during combat or when health is low. The method typically checks for specific
    healthstone item types such as Minor Healthstones, Lesser Healthstones, or Greater
    Healthstones, depending on the implementation details within the TrinityCore framework.
    It serves as a prerequisite check before attempting to consume a healthstone,
    ensuring that the AI does not try to use an item that is not present.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a healthstone is found in the warlock's inventory; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Decision Making
    code: "if (warlockAI->HasHealthstone()) {\n    // Use healthstone before dropping\
      \ below 30% health\n    warlockAI->UseHealthstone();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Healthstone Usage Logic
    code: "if (warlockAI->GetHealthPct() < 50 && warlockAI->HasHealthstone()) {\n\
      \    warlockAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HEALTHSTONE);\n} else if (warlockAI->HasHealthstone())\
      \ {\n    // Store healthstone for later use\n    warlockAI->SetHealthstoneAvailable(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in the AI's item inventory cache rather
    than querying the database directly, making it efficient for frequent checks during
    combat. The implementation may also consider cooldowns or usage restrictions on
    healthstones if such mechanics are enforced by the core.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI's inventory state is properly synchronized with the
    actual character inventory to avoid false positives or negatives. This method
    should not be used as a sole indicator of whether a healthstone can be consumed,
    as additional checks for spell cooldowns or targeting may also be required.
