documentation:
  brief: Assigns enemy targets to a tank player for dungeon combat mechanics
  description: The AssignTankTargets method is responsible for designating specific
    enemy units as targets for a given tank player within a dungeon environment. This
    method ensures proper threat distribution and combat balance by assigning appropriate
    enemies based on dungeon difficulty, player positioning, and combat requirements.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's AI system and is typically
    invoked during dungeon encounter initialization or when a tank player enters combat.
    It may consider factors such as enemy proximity, threat levels, and player capabilities
    to determine optimal target assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the tank character who
      will receive target assignments
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of enemy targets
      to assign to the tank
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Target Assignment
    code: 'Player* myTank = ...; // Get tank player

      int enemyCount = 3;

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.AssignTankTargets(myTank, enemyCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Assignment Based on Difficulty
    code: "Player* tank = ...; // Get current tank\nint enemiesToAssign = 0;\nif (difficulty\
      \ == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n    enemiesToAssign = 5;\nelse if (difficulty\
      \ == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL)\n    enemiesToAssign = 3;\nDungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;\n\
      dungeonBehavior.AssignTankTargets(tank, enemiesToAssign);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's dungeon encounter AI system and should
    only be called during active combat situations. The method assumes that the tank
    player is already in a valid combat state and has proper threat generation capabilities.
    Implementation may involve internal target selection algorithms that consider
    enemy positioning, threat levels, and player abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the tank player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling this method outside of combat situations may result in undefined
    behavior or improper target assignment. The enemies parameter should be a positive
    integer value representing the desired number of targets to assign.
