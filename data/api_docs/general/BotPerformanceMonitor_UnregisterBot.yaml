  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::UnregisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from performance monitoring tracking by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the performance
    monitoring system within TrinityCore. This function is typically invoked when
    a bot is no longer active or has been disconnected from the game world. The method
    takes the bot's unique identifier (GUID) as input and ensures that all associated
    performance data for that bot is cleared from the monitoring structures. It is
    part of the BotPerformanceMonitor class which manages tracking of bot resource
    usage and performance metrics to prevent abuse and maintain server stability.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered from performance
      monitoring. This value must correspond to a valid bot that was previously registered
      with the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnregisterBot Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceMonitor::UnregisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unregister Bot with Validation
    code: "if (IsBotActive(botGuid)) {\n    BotPerformanceMonitor::UnregisterBot(botGuid);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot GUID is valid and corresponds to a registered
    bot. It's recommended to check if the bot exists before unregistering to avoid
    potential errors or undefined behavior. The implementation likely involves removing
    entries from internal data structures such as maps or lists used for tracking
    bot performance metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or performance degradation. Ensure that bots are properly
    registered before attempting to unregister them. This function should not be called
    on bots that are still actively processing or running commands.
