  signature: void Guild::SendEventAwayChanged(const int & memberGuid, bool afk, bool
    dnd)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event notification when a member's away status changes.
  description: The SendEventAwayChanged method is responsible for broadcasting a guild
    event to all online guild members when a specific guild member's away status (AFK
    or DND) is updated. This method ensures that guild members are notified of each
    other's status changes in real-time, which is crucial for coordination during
    group activities such as raids or dungeons. The method takes the GUID of the affected
    member and two boolean flags indicating whether the member is now AFK or DND.
    It internally handles the construction and sending of the appropriate packet to
    all connected guild members.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild member whose away status
      has changed. This value should be a valid player GUID from the database.
  - name: afk
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the member is now away from keyboard
      (AFK). True if the member is AFK, false otherwise.
  - name: dnd
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the member is now in do-not-disturb
      (DND) mode. True if the member is DND, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SetPlayerAwayStatus(Guild* guild, uint32 playerGuid, bool isAfk, bool\
      \ isDnd)\n{\n    guild->SendEventAwayChanged(playerGuid, isAfk, isDnd);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Status in Response to User Action
    code: "void HandlePlayerAFKStatusChange(Player* player, bool newAfkStatus)\n{\n\
      \    if (Guild* guild = player->GetGuild())\n    {\n        bool isDnd = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->IsInGroup()\
      \ && player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGroup()->isRaidGroup();\n       \
      \ guild->SendEventAwayChanged(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), newAfkStatus,\
      \ isDnd);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal packet structures to send updates to players.
    It may be called from various game events such as player login/logout or manual
    status changes via UI. The method does not validate the GUID or status flags,
    so it's expected that callers ensure valid inputs.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may cause undefined behavior
    or packet corruption. Ensure that the memberGuid corresponds to a valid online
    guild member before calling this function.
