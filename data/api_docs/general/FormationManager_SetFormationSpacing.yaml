  class: FormationManager
  method: SetFormationSpacing
  signature: void FormationManager::SetFormationSpacing(float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spacing distance for units in a formation.
  description: The SetFormationSpacing method configures the distance between units
    when they are arranged in a formation. This spacing value determines how far apart
    NPCs or players will position themselves relative to each other within a group.
    The method directly affects the visual and movement behavior of units during formation-based
    AI operations, such as when following a leader or moving in a coordinated pattern.
    It is typically used by AI systems to control group positioning and maintain proper
    distances between members.
  parameters:
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance (in yards) to set as the spacing between units in the
      formation. Must be a positive value; negative or zero values may result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Formation Spacing for a Group
    code: "FormationManager* manager = unit->GetFormation();\nif (manager)\n{\n  \
      \  manager->SetFormationSpacing(3.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Formation Spacing Based on Unit Type
    code: "float spacing = unit->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER ? 2.5f : 4.0f;\nFormationManager*\
      \ manager = unit->GetFormation();\nif (manager)\n{\n    manager->SetFormationSpacing(spacing);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates the internal spacing parameter used by the formation
    logic. Changes take effect immediately for newly formed groups or when the next
    formation update cycle occurs. The spacing value is typically used in conjunction
    with other formation settings like orientation and leader positioning.
  warnings: Setting very small spacing values may cause units to overlap or behave
    erratically during movement. Ensure that spacing values are sufficient to allow
    normal unit movement and avoid collision issues.
