  class: Player
  method: SetRewardedQuest
  signature: void Player::SetRewardedQuest(uint32 quest_id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rewarded quest for the player, marking it as completed and preventing
    further quest progression.
  description: The SetRewardedQuest method marks a specific quest as completed for
    the player, effectively setting the quest's reward status in the game system.
    This method is typically used during quest completion or when a player has successfully
    completed a quest, ensuring that the quest does not appear in their quest log
    anymore and preventing further quest progression for that particular quest. It
    is part of the broader quest management system within TrinityCore and affects
    how the game tracks player progress and rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be set as rewarded. This value
      corresponds to the Quest ID in the database and must match a valid quest that
      exists in the game system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRewardedQuest(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the quest progression
    system. It is typically called after a quest has been completed, and the player's
    quest log should reflect this change. The method may also trigger updates to the
    player's quest status in the database.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest tracking or missing
    rewards. Ensure that the quest_id corresponds to an actual quest that has been
    completed before calling this method, as calling it with invalid quest IDs may
    cause unexpected behavior.
