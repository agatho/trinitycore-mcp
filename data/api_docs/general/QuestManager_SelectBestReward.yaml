documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the best reward ID for a given quest based on player
    progress and quest data.
  description: The SelectBestReward method determines the most appropriate reward
    from a quest's available rewards for the player. It evaluates the quest's reward
    options, considering factors such as player level, quest completion status, and
    reward eligibility. This method is typically used when a player completes a quest
    and the game needs to determine which reward they should receive. The returned
    value represents the ID of the selected reward item or currency from the quest's
    reward list.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the ID of the selected reward. This ID corresponds
    to an entry in the quest's reward data structure, typically referencing an item,
    currency, or experience reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 rewardId = player->GetQuestManager().SelectBestReward(quest);\n\
      if (rewardId > 0)\n{\n    // Process the selected reward\n    player->AddItem(rewardId,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest reward selection logic and may
    consider various factors such as player level, quest flags, and reward prerequisites.
    It's typically called automatically when a quest is completed, but can also be
    invoked manually for custom reward handling.
