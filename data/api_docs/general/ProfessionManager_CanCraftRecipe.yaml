    & recipe) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can craft a specified recipe based on their profession
    levels and requirements.
  description: The CanCraftRecipe method evaluates if a given player has the necessary
    skill levels, required items, and other conditions to successfully craft a specific
    recipe. It checks against the player's current profession ranks, available materials,
    and any additional prerequisites defined in the recipe. This method is typically
    used before attempting to craft an item to prevent invalid crafting attempts and
    provide appropriate feedback to the user.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is attempting to craft the recipe.
      Must not be null.
  - name: recipe
    description: Reference to the RecipeInfo structure containing details about the
      recipe to be crafted, including required skills, materials, and prerequisites.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all requirements to craft the recipe;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CanCraftRecipe
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nRecipeInfo recipe = GetRecipeById(12345);\nif (professionManager.CanCraftRecipe(player,\
      \ recipe)) {\n    // Proceed with crafting\n    CraftItem(player, recipe);\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player they cannot craft the item\n    SendSystemMessage(player,\
      \ \"You do not have the required skills or materials to craft this item.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any state and is purely a query function. It
    may perform database lookups for player profession data, so repeated calls should
    be considered for performance impact.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The recipe parameter must contain complete information
    for accurate evaluation.
