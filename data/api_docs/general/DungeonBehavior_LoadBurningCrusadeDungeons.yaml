  brief: Initializes and loads all Burning Crusade dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior
    system
  description: The LoadBurningCrusadeDungeons method is responsible for loading and
    initializing all dungeon definitions and configurations specific to the Burning
    Crusade expansion (Wrath of the Lich King and later). This method typically reads
    dungeon templates, difficulty settings, spawn points, and other relevant data
    from the database or configuration files. It ensures that all Burning Crusade
    dungeons are properly registered within the DungeonBehavior system so they can
    be accessed by players when attempting to enter these instances. The method is
    usually called during server startup or when expansion data needs to be dynamically
    loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadBurningCrusadeDungeons();

      // Dungeons are now available for player entry'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to fetch dungeon templates and
    may involve caching mechanisms. It should only be called once during initialization
    to avoid duplicate registrations. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and that Burning Crusade content data exists in the appropriate
    tables.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate dungeon entries
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that all required database tables for Burning Crusade
    dungeons are properly populated before invoking this method.
