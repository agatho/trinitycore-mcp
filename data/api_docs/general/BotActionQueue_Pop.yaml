  class: BotActionQueue
  method: Pop
  signature: bool BotActionQueue::Pop(BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Removes and returns the next bot action from the queue
  description: The Pop method retrieves the next available BotAction from the internal
    queue structure. It attempts to extract the first element in the queue and copies
    it into the provided reference parameter. The method returns true if an action
    was successfully retrieved and false if the queue is empty. This operation modifies
    the queue state by removing the returned element, making it a destructive read
    operation. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method is typically
    used to process queued AI actions sequentially.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction object where the popped action will be stored.
      The caller must ensure this object is properly initialized before calling Pop.
  returns: True if an action was successfully removed from the queue and copied into
    the reference parameter; false if the queue is empty and no action could be retrieved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Pop method
    code: "BotAction nextAction;\nif (botQueue.Pop(nextAction)) {\n    // Process\
      \ the retrieved action\n    nextAction.Execute();\n} else {\n    // Queue was\
      \ empty, no action to process\n    printf(\"No actions available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Continuous processing of bot actions
    code: "while (true) {\n    BotAction action;\n    if (!botQueue.Pop(action)) {\n\
      \        break; // No more actions\n    }\n    action.Execute();\n    // Process\
      \ other logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner to process
    bot AI decisions sequentially. The queue implementation may be thread-safe depending
    on the specific BotActionQueue instantiation, but callers should verify thread
    safety requirements for their use case. Performance considerations include potential
    locking mechanisms if the queue is shared across threads.
  warnings: Calling Pop on an empty queue will return false without modifying the
    action parameter. Ensure proper error handling when using this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior. If multiple threads access the same queue, consider synchronization
    mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
