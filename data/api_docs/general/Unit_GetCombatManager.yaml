  brief: Returns the combat manager identifier for the unit
  description: The GetCombatManager method retrieves the unique combat manager identifier
    associated with a Unit object. This identifier is used to track and manage combat-related
    operations within the TrinityCore framework, including handling combat state,
    managing combat events, and coordinating with other combat-related systems. The
    method provides access to the combat manager's internal identifier which is essential
    for maintaining proper combat flow and ensuring accurate tracking of combat-related
    activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the combat manager identifier as an integer value. This identifier
    represents the unique combat manager associated with the unit, allowing developers
    to access and manage combat-related functionality within the framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetCombatManager();

      int combatManagerId = target->GetCombatManager();

      // Use combatManagerId for combat tracking'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat-related code where the combat manager
    needs to be accessed for managing combat state, handling combat events, or coordinating
    with other combat systems. The returned identifier should be treated as a unique
    identifier within the context of combat management.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return invalid identifiers
    if the unit is not properly initialized or in combat state. Avoid using this method
    on units that are not actively engaged in combat to prevent potential errors.
