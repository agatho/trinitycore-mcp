documentation:
  brief: Clears all actions from the action priority queue
  description: The Clear method removes all queued actions from the ActionPriorityQueue,
    effectively resetting its state to empty. This method is typically used when the
    AI needs to discard pending actions and start fresh, such as during state transitions
    or when a new set of priorities is being evaluated. The operation is immediate
    and does not preserve any action history. This method is commonly called before
    adding new actions to ensure that the queue contains only the most relevant actions
    for the current context.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing an Action Priority Queue
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue queue;

      // ... add some actions to the queue ...

      queue.Clear(); // Removes all actions from the queue

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the action queue and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections. If actions are currently being processed,
    calling Clear() will not interrupt them but will remove any queued actions that
    haven't been executed yet.
