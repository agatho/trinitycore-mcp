documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is an innkeeper.
  description: This method checks if the current unit object represents an innkeeper
    NPC in World of Warcraft. It returns true if the unit is an innkeeper, false otherwise.
    The method is commonly used to identify NPCs that provide services for players
    to rest and recover health/mana. This functionality is essential for implementing
    quest logic and player interaction mechanics where innkeepers are involved.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is an innkeeper, false otherwise. The return value
    indicates whether the unit's entry ID matches that of a known innkeeper type in
    the game database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsInnkeeper()) {\n    // Handle innkeeper logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the unit's entry ID matching known innkeeper types
    in the database. It does not consider whether the unit is actually serving the
    player or not, just that it is an innkeeper type.
  warnings: The method does not distinguish between different types of innkeepers
    (e.g., regular vs faction-specific), so care should be taken when using this method
    for complex quest logic involving multiple innkeeper types.
