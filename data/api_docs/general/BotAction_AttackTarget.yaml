  class: BotAction
  method: AttackTarget
  signature: BotAction BotAction::AttackTarget(int bot, int target, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an attack action by a bot towards a specified target.
  description: The AttackTarget method is used to command a bot to attack a specific
    target within the game world. This method sets up the necessary AI behavior for
    the bot to engage in combat with the designated target. It typically involves
    calculating the appropriate combat stance, initiating the attack sequence, and
    managing the bot's targeting state. The timestamp parameter allows for precise
    control over when the action is executed, which can be useful for synchronizing
    actions or implementing cooldowns. This method is part of the broader bot AI system
    in TrinityCore, enabling scripted or automated player behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will perform the attack
      action. This value must correspond to a valid active bot within the game world.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity that the bot will
      attack. This can be another player, NPC, or creature within the game world.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A timestamp value indicating when the attack action should be initiated.
      This is typically used for timing synchronization and can represent milliseconds
      since epoch or game time.
  returns: Returns a BotAction object representing the newly created attack action.
    The returned object contains information about the action state, including whether
    it was successfully queued or executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Target Usage
    code: "BotAction action = botAI->AttackTarget(12345, 67890, getGameTime());\n\
      if (action.IsValid()) {\n    // Action successfully queued\n    printf(\"Bot\
      \ 12345 attacking target 67890\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Target with Delayed Execution
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = getGameTime();

      uint32 delay = 1000; // 1 second delay

      BotAction action = botAI->AttackTarget(12345, 67890, currentTime + delay);

      printf("Scheduled attack for bot 12345 against target 67890 in 1 second\n");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the bot and target entities are valid and within
    the game world. The method does not perform validation on entity existence or
    validity, so callers should ensure these preconditions are met. The timestamp
    parameter allows for precise timing control but requires careful consideration
    of game time synchronization to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid bot or target GUIDs may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the entities exist and are in a valid state before
    calling AttackTarget. Be cautious when using timestamps that are in the past,
    as this might cause immediate execution of actions which could interfere with
    existing AI states.
