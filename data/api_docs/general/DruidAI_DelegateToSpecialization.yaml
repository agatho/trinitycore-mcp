  class: DruidAI
  method: DelegateToSpecialization
  signature: void DruidAI::DelegateToSpecialization(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Delegates AI behavior to the druid's current specialization.
  description: The DelegateToSpecialization method in the DruidAI class is responsible
    for routing the AI's decision-making process to the appropriate specialization-specific
    behavior. This method ensures that the druid AI adapts its actions based on the
    player's current specialization (Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration). It
    typically involves checking the druid's current form and specialization state,
    then invoking the corresponding specialization's AI logic. The method is crucial
    for maintaining proper gameplay mechanics where each druid specialization has
    distinct abilities, priorities, and behaviors in combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target selection or priority
      value. This parameter may be used internally by the specialization delegation
      logic to determine which target to prioritize or how to handle the current engagement
      state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void DruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    int target = GetTargetPriority();\n    DelegateToSpecialization(&target);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with specialization switching
    code: "void DruidAI::OnSpecializationChange()\n{\n    int target = 0;\n    if\
      \ (me->GetShapeshiftForm() == FORM_BEAR)\n        target = 1; // Guardian priority\n\
      \    else if (me->GetShapeshiftForm() == FORM_CAT)\n        target = 2; // Feral\
      \ priority\n    \n    DelegateToSpecialization(&target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal state tracking of the druid's current
    specialization and form. It may be called frequently during AI update cycles,
    so performance is important. The target parameter might influence how the delegation
    logic prioritizes actions or selects targets based on specialization.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter could lead to incorrect specialization
    behavior or unexpected AI decision-making. Ensure that the target value passed
    is valid for the current druid state and specialization context.
