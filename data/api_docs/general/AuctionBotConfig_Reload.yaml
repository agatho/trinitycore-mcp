  class: AuctionBotConfig
  method: Reload
  signature: void AuctionBotConfig::Reload()
documentation:
  brief: Reloads the auction bot configuration settings from the database or file
    sources.
  description: The Reload method updates the internal configuration state of the AuctionBotConfig
    class by refreshing all settings from their source, typically the database or
    configuration files. This allows for dynamic updates to auction bot behavior without
    requiring a server restart. The method ensures that any changes made to the configuration
    are immediately reflected in the auction bot's operations. It is commonly used
    during runtime when administrators need to adjust auction bot parameters without
    downtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reload Usage
    code: AuctionBotConfig::instance()->Reload();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the auction bot is not actively processing
    auctions to avoid inconsistent behavior. The reload operation may involve database
    queries and file I/O operations, so frequent calls could impact performance.
  warnings: Calling this method while the auction bot is actively running may cause
    temporary inconsistencies in auction processing. It's recommended to pause auction
    activities before reloading configuration settings.
