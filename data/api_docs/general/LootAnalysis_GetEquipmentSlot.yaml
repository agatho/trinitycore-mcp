  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetEquipmentSlot
  signature: uint32 LootAnalysis::GetEquipmentSlot(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the equipment slot type for a given loot item.
  description: The GetEquipmentSlot method analyzes a LootItem object and returns
    the corresponding equipment slot identifier. This is used in World of Warcraft's
    loot system to categorize items by where they can be equipped on a character.
    The method evaluates the item's properties such as class, subclass, and inventory
    type to determine its appropriate slot. It serves as a core component in loot
    distribution logic, enabling proper item assignment during loot rolling and itemization
    processes.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A const reference to a LootItem object representing the item being
      analyzed for equipment slot assignment.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the equipment slot type. This corresponds
    to the EquipmentSlots enumeration values used internally by TrinityCore's item
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: "LootItem* lootItem = player->GetLoot()->GetLootItem(0);\nuint32 slotType\
      \ = lootAnalysis->GetEquipmentSlot(*lootItem);\nif (slotType != EQUIPMENT_SLOT_END)\n\
      {\n    // Process item based on its equipment slot\n    switch (slotType)\n\
      \    {\n        case EQUIPMENT_SLOT_HEAD:\n            // Handle head slot items\n\
      \            break;\n        case EQUIPMENT_SLOT_CHEST:\n            // Handle\
      \ chest slot items\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Item Slot for Inventory Management
    code: "void ProcessLootItem(LootAnalysis* lootAnalyzer, LootItem& item)\n{\n \
      \   uint32 slot = lootAnalyzer->GetEquipmentSlot(item);\n    if (slot < EQUIPMENT_SLOT_END)\n\
      \    {\n        // Assign item to appropriate inventory slot\n        Player*\
      \ player = item.GetOwner();\n        if (player)\n        {\n            player->AddItemToInventory(slot,\
      \ item.itemid);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot analysis system and relies on internal item
    database lookups to determine slot assignments. The returned slot values match
    standard World of Warcraft equipment slot constants. Performance is generally
    good as it operates on cached item data, but repeated calls for many items may
    impact performance during large loot events.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootItem object passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized before calling. Passing a null or uninitialized reference could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes proper item metadata exists
    in the database.
