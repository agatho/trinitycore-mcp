documentation:
  brief: Moves an AuctionHouseMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources
    to the target object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on the AuctionHouseMgr
    class, transferring all resources from the source object to the target object.
    This operation is typically used when assigning one AuctionHouseMgr instance to
    another, effectively moving the internal data and state rather than copying it.
    In the context of TrinityCore's auction house system, this allows for efficient
    resource management when handling auction house data structures. The move assignment
    operator ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state
    after the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the AuctionHouseMgr object that received the moved resources,
    enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionHouseMgr manager1;

      AuctionHouseMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move assignment

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. The source
    object after move assignment should not be used unless re-assigned or moved from
    again. This operation is typically more efficient than copy assignment as it avoids
    deep copying of internal data structures.
  warnings: Using the source object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any references or pointers to the moved-from object are
    not used afterward.
