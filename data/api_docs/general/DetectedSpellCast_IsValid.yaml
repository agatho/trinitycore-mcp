  signature: bool DetectedSpellCast::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the detected spell cast object is valid and can be safely used.
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a DetectedSpellCast object has
    been properly initialized and contains valid data. This method is typically used
    to verify that the spell cast information retrieved from the game environment
    is reliable before performing operations on it. It checks internal state flags
    or data integrity to ensure the object represents a legitimate detected spell
    cast event. The method returns false if the object is in an invalid state, such
    as being uninitialized or having been marked for deletion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the DetectedSpellCast object is valid and contains reliable
    data; otherwise returns false if the object is invalid or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "DetectedSpellCast* detectedCast = player->GetDetectedSpellCast();\nif (detectedCast\
      \ && detectedCast->IsValid()) {\n    // Safe to use detectedCast\n    SpellInfo\
      \ const* spellInfo = detectedCast->GetSpellInfo();\n    // Process the spell\
      \ cast information\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in combat scenario
    code: "void HandleDetectedSpellCast(Player* player) {\n    DetectedSpellCast*\
      \ cast = player->GetDetectedSpellCast();\n    if (!cast || !cast->IsValid())\
      \ {\n        // Skip processing if invalid\n        return;\n    }\n    \n \
      \   // Proceed with valid spell cast handling\n    uint32 spellId = cast->GetSpellId();\n\
      \    ObjectGuid casterGuid = cast->GetCasterGuid();\n    // ... additional logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight validation check and should not be used
    in performance-critical code paths without consideration. The validity of the
    object may change between calls if external factors modify the underlying spell
    cast data.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null pointer returned by GetDetectedSpellCast()
    is valid - always call IsValid() before using the object for any operations.
