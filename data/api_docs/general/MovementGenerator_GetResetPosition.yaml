  class: MovementGenerator
  method: GetResetPosition
  signature: bool MovementGenerator::GetResetPosition(Unit * param0, float & param1,
    float & param2, float & param3)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reset position for a movement generator, returning true if
    successful.
  description: The GetResetPosition method is used to obtain the reset coordinates
    for a MovementGenerator instance. This typically represents the original or default
    position that an AI-controlled unit should return to after completing a movement
    sequence or when resetting its behavior. The method populates three float parameters
    with X, Y, and Z coordinates respectively. It returns true if the reset position
    was successfully retrieved and false otherwise, which may occur if the movement
    generator has not been initialized properly or lacks valid reset data.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which the reset position is being
      requested. This represents the entity whose movement behavior is managed by
      this MovementGenerator.
  - name: param1
    description: Reference to a float variable that will be filled with the X coordinate
      of the reset position.
  - name: param2
    description: Reference to a float variable that will be filled with the Y coordinate
      of the reset position.
  - name: param3
    description: Reference to a float variable that will be filled with the Z coordinate
      of the reset position.
  returns: Returns true if the reset position was successfully retrieved and populated
    into the provided coordinates; otherwise returns false, indicating failure or
    invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve reset position
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = ...;\nUnit* unit = ...;\nfloat x, y, z;\nif (mg->GetResetPosition(unit,\
      \ x, y, z)) {\n    // Successfully retrieved reset position\n    printf(\"Reset\
      \ position: (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", x, y, z);\n} else {\n    // Failed to retrieve\
      \ reset position\n    printf(\"Failed to get reset position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to
    manage unit behavior and positioning. The reset position is often set during initialization
    or when a movement sequence is completed. It's important to note that this method
    does not perform any validation on whether the provided Unit pointer is valid,
    so calling code should ensure it points to a valid object.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid Unit pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior. Additionally, if the MovementGenerator has not been properly initialized
    or configured, the returned coordinates might be meaningless or incorrect.
