  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleSortBankBags
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSortBankBags(WorldPackets::Item::SortBankBags
    & sortBankBags)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to sort the player's bank bag items into alphabetical
    order.
  description: The HandleSortBankBags method handles the packet sent by the client
    when a player requests to sort their bank bag contents. This function is part
    of the WorldSession class and is responsible for reorganizing the items in the
    player's bank bags according to their item names, typically in alphabetical order.
    It ensures that the sorting operation respects the player's inventory constraints
    and updates the server-side representation accordingly. The method does not directly
    interact with the client's UI but processes the request and applies the sorting
    logic server-side.
  parameters:
  - name: sortBankBags
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Item::SortBankBags packet containing
      the sorting request from the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within WorldSession context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSortBankBags(WorldPackets::Item::SortBankBags\
      \ & sortBankBags)\n{\n    // Sorting logic would be implemented here\n    //\
      \ This method is called when the client sends a sort request\n    // No return\
      \ value expected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the standard packet handling
    flow within the WorldSession class. It assumes that the player has access to their
    bank and that the bank bags are properly initialized. The actual sorting algorithm
    used may depend on internal implementation details of how items are ordered in
    the inventory system.
