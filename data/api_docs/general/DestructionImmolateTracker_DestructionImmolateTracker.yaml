  brief: Initializes a new instance of the DestructionImmolateTracker class
  description: The DestructionImmolateTracker constructor initializes the tracking
    system for immolate effects in the destruction spell system. This method sets
    up internal data structures and state variables required to monitor and manage
    immolate damage application, duration tracking, and aura management for destruction
    warlocks. The constructor ensures that all necessary member variables are properly
    initialized before the tracker can be used to process immolate effects on targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Immolate Tracker Instance
    code: "DestructionImmolateTracker* tracker = new DestructionImmolateTracker();\n\
      // The tracker is now ready to track immolate effects\nif (tracker)\n{\n   \
      \ // Use the tracker for managing immolate auras\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new instance of the
    destruction immolate tracker. It is typically invoked internally by the spell
    system when an immolate effect needs to be tracked, rather than being called directly
    by external code.
