  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::MonitorEventHealth(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors and updates the health status of a specified guild event.
  description: The MonitorEventHealth method is responsible for tracking and managing
    the current state and health of a guild event identified by its unique event ID.
    This function likely checks if the event is active, verifies its progress, and
    ensures that all related systems are synchronized with the event's current status.
    It may also handle cleanup or notification processes when an event reaches certain
    thresholds or concludes. The method operates within the GuildEventCoordinator
    class which manages various guild-related events in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to monitor. This ID corresponds
      to a specific event instance within the guild event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Health Monitoring
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.MonitorEventHealth(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Multiple Events in Loop
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nfor (uint32 eventId : activeEvents)\
      \ {\n    coordinator.MonitorEventHealth(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically or triggered by event-specific
    conditions. It may involve database operations to update event states and could
    be part of a larger event management system that handles guild activities such
    as raids, quests, or PvP events.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to an existing event; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined. This method should not be called with invalid or uninitialized
    event IDs.
