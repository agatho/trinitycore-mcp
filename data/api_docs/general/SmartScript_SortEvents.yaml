  method: SortEvents
  signature: void SmartScript::SortEvents(SmartAIEventList & events)
documentation:
  brief: Sorts SmartAI events in ascending order based on their event type and trigger
    conditions.
  description: The SortEvents method organizes a list of SmartAI events according
    to their internal sorting criteria, typically prioritizing events by their event
    type and associated trigger conditions. This ensures that events are processed
    in a consistent and predictable order during AI execution. The method modifies
    the input event list in-place without creating new objects. It is commonly used
    internally by the SmartScript system to maintain proper event sequencing for NPC
    behaviors. The sorting behavior may depend on event priorities defined within
    the SmartAI framework, ensuring that higher-priority events are executed before
    lower-priority ones when triggers occur.
  parameters:
  - name: events
    description: A reference to a SmartAIEventList containing the events to be sorted.
      This list is modified in-place by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sorting AI Events for an NPC
    code: 'SmartAIEventList eventList;

      // Populate eventList with various SmartAI events

      smartScript->SortEvents(eventList);

      // Now eventList is sorted by event type and priority'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an in-place sort operation, modifying the original list.
    It's typically called during initialization or when updating AI behavior dynamically.
    The sorting algorithm used internally may be optimized for performance in large
    event sets.
