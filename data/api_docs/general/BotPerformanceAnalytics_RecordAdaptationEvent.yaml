  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: RecordAdaptationEvent
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::RecordAdaptationEvent(uint32_t botGuid,
    const std::string & eventType)
documentation:
  brief: Records an adaptation event for a bot with the specified GUID and event type.
  description: The RecordAdaptationEvent method logs a specific adaptation event associated
    with a bot in the TrinityCore system. This function is typically used to track
    how bots modify their behavior or strategies based on environmental changes, player
    interactions, or internal decision-making processes. The method stores information
    about the bot's unique identifier (GUID) and the type of adaptation event that
    occurred, which can later be analyzed for performance tuning, AI behavior evaluation,
    or debugging purposes. It is designed to be called during runtime when a bot undergoes
    a significant behavioral change.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that triggered the adaptation
      event. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the TrinityCore
      world.
  - name: eventType
    description: A string describing the type of adaptation event that occurred. Valid
      values may include 'behavior_change', 'strategy_shift', or other custom event
      types defined by the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BotPerformanceAnalytics::Instance()->RecordAdaptationEvent(12345, "behavior_change");
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Event Type
    code: 'std::string eventType = GetBotAdaptationType(botGuid);

      BotPerformanceAnalytics::Instance()->RecordAdaptationEvent(botGuid, eventType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the analytics framework and may have performance implications
    if called excessively. It is recommended to batch events or use asynchronous logging
    for high-frequency calls. The implementation assumes that the bot GUID is valid
    and corresponds to an active bot entity.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid before calling this method,
    otherwise unexpected behavior or crashes might occur. Also, avoid calling this
    method from multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
