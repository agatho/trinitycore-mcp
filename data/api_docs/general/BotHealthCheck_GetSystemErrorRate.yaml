  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: GetSystemErrorRate
  signature: float BotHealthCheck::GetSystemErrorRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current system error rate for bot health checks.
  description: The GetSystemErrorRate method computes the proportion of failed health
    checks relative to total checks performed within a specified time window. This
    metric is used to assess the overall stability and reliability of the bot system.
    The method tracks internal counters for successful and failed health evaluations
    and returns a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no
    errors and 1.0 indicates all checks have failed. This value can be used by monitoring
    systems or automated recovery mechanisms to determine if corrective action is
    needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the system error rate as a ratio of failed checks
    to total checks. Returns 0.0 when no checks have been performed, and 1.0 when
    all checks have failed. Values between 0.0 and 1.0 indicate the proportion of
    failed health evaluations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float errorRate = botHealthCheck.GetSystemErrorRate();\nif (errorRate >\
      \ 0.5f) {\n    // Trigger alert or recovery mechanism\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      High system error rate detected: %.2f\", errorRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Integration
    code: "class BotHealthMonitor {\npublic:\n    void CheckSystemHealth() {\n   \
      \     float rate = botHealthCheck.GetSystemErrorRate();\n        if (rate >\
      \ 0.8f) {\n            // Initiate emergency shutdown sequence\n           \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Critical error rate detected: %.2f\", rate);\n        } else\
      \ if (rate > 0.3f) {\n            // Log warning and schedule maintenance\n\
      \            sLog->outWarning(\"Elevated error rate: %.2f\", rate);\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method maintains internal state for tracking health check results, so
    it's important to ensure that the BotHealthCheck object is properly initialized
    and updated with actual health check data. The error rate calculation may be affected
    by the time window used for averaging, which should be configurable or documented
    in related system settings.
  warnings: This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally.
    If multiple threads access the same BotHealthCheck instance concurrently, external
    synchronization may be required to prevent race conditions in the internal counters.
    Additionally, calling this method before any health checks have been performed
    will return 0.0, which might be misinterpreted as a healthy system state.
