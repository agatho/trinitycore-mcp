documentation:
  brief: Feeds the hunter's pet when necessary based on pet hunger status and available
    food items.
  description: The FeedPetIfNeeded method checks if the hunter's pet is hungry and
    has sufficient food items in the inventory to feed it. If both conditions are
    met, the method will automatically feed the pet using an appropriate food item
    from the hunter's backpack or usable items. This method ensures that pets remain
    healthy and functional during combat by maintaining their hunger levels. The implementation
    respects game mechanics such as pet food item types, hunger thresholds, and inventory
    management to prevent unnecessary actions when the pet is already well-fed or
    when no suitable food is available.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    m_hunter->FeedPetIfNeeded();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during AI update cycles or periodic
    checks to ensure pets are properly maintained. It does not directly interact with
    the game server's packet system but relies on internal pet and inventory state
    tracking.
