documentation:
  brief: Returns the display ID of the mount currently being used by the unit.
  description: The GetMountDisplayId method retrieves the visual display ID of the
    mount that a Unit (such as a player or creature) is currently riding. This value
    represents the graphical representation of the mount in the game world and is
    used for rendering purposes. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other
    mount-related functions to determine the current mount state, including whether
    the unit is mounted or not. It can be particularly useful for checking if a player
    is using a specific type of mount, such as flying mounts or ground mounts, and
    for implementing game mechanics that depend on mount display information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the display ID of the mounted creature
    or player. This value corresponds to the visual representation of the mount in
    the game world and can be used to identify specific mount types or states. If
    no mount is active, the return value will be 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 mountDisplayId = unit->GetMountDisplayId();\nif (mountDisplayId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Player is mounted\n    // Do something with the mount display\
      \ ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for specific mount type
    code: "uint32 mountDisplayId = unit->GetMountDisplayId();\nif (mountDisplayId\
      \ == 12345)\n{\n    // Player is using a specific mount\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and typically used in conjunction with
    other mount-related methods. It's important to note that this method returns the
    display ID of the mount itself, not the actual mount entry ID. The method may
    return 0 if no mount is active or if the unit is not currently mounted.
  warnings: Be aware that this method will return 0 if the unit is not mounted, which
    can lead to incorrect assumptions about the mount state. Also, the display ID
    returned by this method might be different from the actual mount entry ID used
    for determining mount availability or unlock status.
