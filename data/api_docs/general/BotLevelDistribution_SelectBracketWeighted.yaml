documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a weighted random LevelBracket based on faction for bot
    level distribution.
  description: The SelectBracketWeighted method performs a weighted random selection
    from a collection of LevelBracket objects associated with the BotLevelDistribution
    instance. It takes into account the specified faction to determine which brackets
    are eligible for selection, ensuring that bots are assigned levels according to
    predefined weight distributions that reflect game balance and progression mechanics.
    This method is typically used in AI or bot behavior systems where consistent yet
    randomized level assignment is required. The selection process uses internal weighting
    logic that may be influenced by factors such as player faction, difficulty settings,
    or other balancing parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const LevelBracket object representing the selected bracket.
    Returns nullptr if no valid brackets exist for the given faction or if the distribution
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const LevelBracket* bracket = botDistribution.SelectBracketWeighted(0);\n\
      if (bracket != nullptr)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Selected bracket level range:\
      \ \" << bracket->minLevel << \" - \" << bracket->maxLevel << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal weighting mechanisms that may be precomputed
    or dynamically adjusted based on game state. The returned LevelBracket pointer
    is valid only as long as the BotLevelDistribution object remains in scope and
    unmodified.
  warnings: Ensure that the faction parameter corresponds to a valid faction ID recognized
    by the system; invalid IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or null returns.
    This method should not be called during critical sections where thread safety
    is required unless proper synchronization is in place.
