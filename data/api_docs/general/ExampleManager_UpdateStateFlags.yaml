  signature: void ExampleManager::UpdateStateFlags()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state flags of the example manager based on current
    conditions and game logic.
  description: The UpdateStateFlags method is responsible for synchronizing and refreshing
    the internal state flags within the ExampleManager class. This method typically
    evaluates various conditions, such as player actions, environmental changes, or
    system events, to determine the appropriate state flags that should be active.
    It ensures that the manager's internal representation remains consistent with
    the current game state. The method is generally called during tick cycles or in
    response to specific triggers within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining accurate state tracking in systems that rely on conditional
    logic based on multiple factors.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: 'ExampleManager* manager = new ExampleManager();

      manager->UpdateStateFlags(); // Updates internal state flags

      // This would typically be called within a periodic update loop'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Event Handling
    code: "void OnPlayerInteraction(Player* player) {\n    ExampleManager* manager\
      \ = GetExampleManager();\n    // Perform some action based on player interaction\n\
      \    manager->UpdateStateFlags(); // Refresh state after event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be performance-sensitive if called frequently. It's recommended
    to only invoke this method when necessary, such as after significant state changes
    or during regular update cycles. The implementation likely involves checking multiple
    conditions and setting/unsetting bit flags efficiently.
  warnings: Avoid calling UpdateStateFlags excessively without proper throttling,
    as it could lead to unnecessary CPU overhead. Ensure that all dependencies required
    for flag evaluation are properly initialized before calling this method.
