  class: IVMapManager
  method: existsMap
  signature: LoadResult IVMapManager::existsMap(const char * pBasePath, unsigned int
    pMapId, int x, int y)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific map tile exists for the given map ID and coordinates.
  description: The existsMap method determines whether a particular map tile is available
    for loading within the TrinityCore instance. It verifies the existence of map
    data files at the specified base path for a given map ID and grid coordinates
    (x, y). This functionality is crucial for terrain and navigation systems in World
    of Warcraft emulation, ensuring that only valid map tiles are processed during
    world loading or player movement. The method returns a LoadResult enum indicating
    success, failure, or other status conditions related to the map tile's availability.
  parameters:
  - name: pBasePath
    description: The base directory path where map data files are stored. This typically
      points to the 'maps' directory in the TrinityCore installation.
  - name: pMapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map to check. This corresponds to the
      Map ID used internally by the game engine and must match valid map entries in
      the database.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid tile to verify. Grid coordinates are
      typically in the range [0, 63] for standard map tiles.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid tile to verify. Grid coordinates are
      typically in the range [0, 63] for standard map tiles.
  returns: Returns a LoadResult enum value indicating the status of the map tile existence
    check. Possible values include LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS if the tile exists and can
    be loaded, LOAD_RESULT_ERROR if an error occurred during verification, and LOAD_RESULT_NOT_FOUND
    if no data file exists for the specified tile.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to verify map tile existence
    code: "const char* basePath = \"maps\";\nuint32 mapId = 0; // Eastern Kingdoms\n\
      int x = 10;\nint y = 15;\nLoadResult result = VMapManager2->existsMap(basePath,\
      \ mapId, x, y);\nif (result == LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS) {\n    // Tile exists and\
      \ can be loaded\n    printf(\"Map tile (%d,%d) for map %u is available\\n\"\
      , x, y, mapId);\n} else {\n    // Tile does not exist or cannot be loaded\n\
      \    printf(\"Map tile (%d,%d) for map %u is not available\\n\", x, y, mapId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used by the VMapManager system to determine which
    map tiles should be loaded into memory. It performs file system checks without
    actually loading the tile data, making it efficient for pre-checking before full
    loading operations. The method assumes that map files follow standard naming conventions
    expected by TrinityCore's VMap implementation.
  warnings: This method does not validate the actual content of map files beyond their
    existence. A successful return does not guarantee that the tile will load correctly
    if the file is corrupted or incompatible with the current version of the emulator.
    Additionally, calling this method in high-frequency scenarios may cause performance
    overhead due to filesystem operations.
