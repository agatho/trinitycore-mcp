documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker class.
  description: The VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker constructor initializes the tracking
    mechanism for demon spikes related to the vengeance ability in World of Warcraft.
    This class is typically used within the context of warlock specializations, particularly
    for managing the state and behavior of demon spikes during combat. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures necessary to track spike damage, cooldowns,
    and other relevant mechanics associated with the Vengeance talent. It ensures
    that the tracker is in a valid state before being used in gameplay scenarios.

  - title: Creating a new VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker instance
    code: 'VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker* tracker = new VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track demon spikes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or require external
    dependencies. It primarily sets up internal member variables to their default
    states. Developers should ensure that the tracker is properly managed in memory,
    especially if used in frequently created/destroyed contexts.
