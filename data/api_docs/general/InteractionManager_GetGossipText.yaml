  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetGossipText
  signature: std::string InteractionManager::GetGossipText(Player * bot, Creature
    * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the gossip text associated with a creature for a specific player
    bot.
  description: The GetGossipText method fetches the appropriate gossip text that should
    be displayed to a player bot when interacting with a specified creature. This
    method is typically used in AI scripts or botting systems to determine what text
    the bot should show during NPC interactions. The returned string contains the
    localized gossip text that would normally appear in the gossip window. The method
    considers the player's state, quest status, and other relevant factors to return
    the correct text for the given creature.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is initiating
      the interaction with the NPC.
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that represents the NPC whose gossip
      text is being retrieved.
  returns: A std::string containing the gossip text to be displayed for the specified
    player and creature combination. Returns an empty string if no valid gossip text
    exists or if there's an error in retrieving the text.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::string gossipText = interactionManager->GetGossipText(playerBot, npcCreature);\n\
      if (!gossipText.empty()) {\n    // Display the gossip text to the player\n \
      \   playerBot->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(1, npcCreature->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "std::string gossipText = interactionManager->GetGossipText(playerBot, npc);\n\
      if (gossipText.find(\"Quest\") != std::string::npos) {\n    // Handle quest-related\
      \ gossip\n    playerBot->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(1001, npc->GetGUID());\n\
      } else if (gossipText.find(\"Vendor\") != std::string::npos) {\n    // Handle\
      \ vendor gossip\n    playerBot->PlayerTalkClass->SendVendorWindow(npc);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Default gossip handling\n    playerBot->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(0,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal tables or databases to determine the
    appropriate gossip text based on player and NPC states. It may involve checking
    quest completion status, faction standings, and other game conditions. The implementation
    might be cached or precomputed for performance reasons in botting scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and npc parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as dereferencing null pointers will cause crashes. This method
    should only be called during active NPC interaction contexts to ensure accurate
    results.
