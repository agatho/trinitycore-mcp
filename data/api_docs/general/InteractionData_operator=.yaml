  brief: Moves resources from another InteractionData object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the source
    InteractionData object to this object, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified
    state. This operation is typically used for efficient resource management in scenarios
    where temporary objects are being assigned to persistent ones. In the context
    of TrinityCore's interaction system, this method facilitates efficient handling
    of interaction data structures during gameplay events such as NPC dialogues or
    quest interactions. The move semantics ensure that expensive operations like memory
    allocation and copying are avoided, improving performance when dealing with large
    interaction data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current InteractionData object after the move assignment
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'InteractionData data1;

      InteractionData data2 = std::move(data1); // Move-assigns data1 to data2

      // data1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Game Event Handling
    code: "void HandleInteractionEvent()\n{\n    InteractionData tempData;\n    //\
      \ ... populate tempData with interaction information ...\n    playerInteractionData\
      \ = std::move(tempData); // Efficiently transfer data\n    // tempData is now\
      \ empty and ready for reuse\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which are crucial for performance
    optimization in TrinityCore's interaction system. The source object after move
    assignment remains in a valid state but its contents are unspecified. This method
    should only be used when the source object is no longer needed, as attempting
    to use it afterward may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Using this operator on an object that is still actively referenced elsewhere
    can lead to resource corruption or undefined behavior. Always ensure the source
    object is not used after move assignment. Be cautious when using in multithreaded
    contexts where other threads might be accessing the source object simultaneously.
