  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarEventInviteRemoveAlert(int guid, const
    CalendarEvent & calendarEvent, CalendarInviteStatus status) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event invite removal alert to the specified player.
  description: The SendCalendarEventInviteRemoveAlert method is responsible for notifying
    a player that their invitation to a calendar event has been removed. This typically
    occurs when an event organizer revokes an invitation or when an invitee declines
    an event invitation. The method sends a specific packet to the player's client
    containing details about the removed invitation, including the event ID and the
    status of the removal. It is part of the calendar system's functionality within
    TrinityCore and ensures that players are properly informed of changes to their
    event invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will receive
      the alert. This identifies the specific client that should be notified about
      the invite removal.
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A reference to the CalendarEvent structure containing details about
      the event from which the invitation was removed. This includes event ID, title,
      and other relevant metadata.
  - name: status
    description: The CalendarInviteStatus enum value indicating the reason for the
      invite removal. Common values include INVITE_STATUS_REMOVED, INVITE_STATUS_DECLINED,
      or similar status indicators.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending an Invite Removal Alert
    code: CalendarMgr::instance()->SendCalendarEventInviteRemoveAlert(playerGuid,
      event, INVITE_STATUS_REMOVED);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when invite
    statuses change. It assumes that the player GUID is valid and that the calendar
    event exists in the system. The actual packet sending is handled through the player's
    session, so no direct network calls are required from the caller.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an active player session,
    otherwise the alert will not be sent. Also verify that the calendarEvent parameter
    contains valid data to prevent potential crashes or incorrect alerts.
