  brief: Enables or disables the behavior manager's functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BehaviorManager is active
    and processing behaviors. When enabled, the manager will handle AI logic and behavior
    execution for associated entities. When disabled, all behavior processing is suspended
    until re-enabled. This method is typically used to temporarily pause AI behavior
    during events, loading sequences, or debugging sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the behavior manager.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: 'BehaviorManager* bm = player->GetBehaviorManager();

      bm->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Enable/Disable Based on Game State
    code: "if (gameState == GAME_STATE_COMBAT) {\n    behaviorManager->SetEnabled(false);\n\
      } else {\n    behaviorManager->SetEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the state of AI processing for all entities
    managed by this BehaviorManager instance. Changes take effect immediately without
    requiring additional synchronization or update cycles.
  warnings: Disabling the behavior manager during active combat or critical gameplay
    events may cause unexpected behavior or loss of AI functionality until re-enabled.
    Ensure proper state management when toggling this setting.
