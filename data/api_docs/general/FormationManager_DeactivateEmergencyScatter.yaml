documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the emergency scatter behavior for units in formation.
  description: The DeactivateEmergencyScatter method disables the emergency scattering
    mechanism that is typically triggered when a unit in a formation becomes threatened
    or takes damage. This function ensures that units will no longer automatically
    break from their formation and scatter to random locations during combat. It is
    generally called when the emergency state is resolved or when normal formation
    behavior should be restored. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations.

  returns: null

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ActivateEmergencyScatter
    to control formation behavior during combat. It should be called after an emergency
    situation has been handled.
