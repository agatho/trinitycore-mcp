  class: CalendarMgr
  method: FreeEventId
  signature: void CalendarMgr::FreeEventId(uint64 id)
documentation:
  brief: Frees a calendar event ID for reuse by the system.
  description: The FreeEventId method releases a previously allocated calendar event
    identifier, making it available for future use. This method is typically called
    when a calendar event is deleted or removed from the system to prevent ID conflicts
    and ensure proper resource management. The calendar manager maintains a pool of
    available IDs and this function returns the specified ID back to that pool. It's
    important to note that calling this method with an invalid or already-freed ID
    may result in undefined behavior or system inconsistencies.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique 64-bit identifier of the calendar event to be freed. This
      should correspond to a valid event ID that was previously allocated by the CalendarMgr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Freeing a Calendar Event ID
    code: 'uint64 eventId = sCalendarMgr->GetNextEventId();

      // ... use the event ID ...

      sCalendarMgr->FreeEventId(eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar system's internal resource management.
    It should only be called with IDs that were previously allocated by the CalendarMgr
    to avoid corrupting the ID pool. The implementation likely uses a bitset or similar
    data structure to track used and free event IDs.
  warnings: Calling FreeEventId with an invalid ID (e.g., zero or an ID not previously
    allocated) may cause memory corruption or ID reuse conflicts. Always ensure that
    the ID being freed was actually allocated by the calendar manager before calling
    this method.
