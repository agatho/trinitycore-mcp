  signature: void Unit::RemoveAllAurasExceptType(int type1, int type2)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras from the unit except those of specified types
  description: This method removes all aura applications from a Unit object, excluding
    those matching the specified aura types. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    to clear specific aura effects while preserving others. The method operates on
    the unit's aura list and can be used to manage various gameplay scenarios such
    as removing debuffs or buffs that are not of a particular type. This functionality
    is essential for implementing custom behavior in World of Warcraft server-side
    scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: type1
    description: 'First aura type to exclude from removal. Valid values include: 0
      (none), 1 (self), 2 (target), etc. This parameter defines which aura types should
      be preserved during the removal process.'
  - name: type2
    description: Second aura type to exclude from removal. Similar to type1, this
      parameter defines which additional aura types should be preserved during the
      removal process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();


      // Remove all auras except type 1 and type 2

      target->RemoveAllAurasExceptType(1, 2);


      // This will remove all auras except those of type 1 and type 2

      // from the target unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Example with multiple types

      Unit* target = GetTarget();


      // Remove all auras except types 3, 5, and 7

      target->RemoveAllAurasExceptType(3, 5);


      // This will remove all auras except those of type 3 and type 5

      // from the target unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related methods
    to implement complex gameplay mechanics. Performance considerations include potential
    memory usage when removing large numbers of auras simultaneously. The method should
    be used carefully as it can affect unit's status effects and gameplay behavior.
  warnings: This method may cause unexpected behavior if used incorrectly, especially
    when dealing with multiple aura types. It is recommended to understand the specific
    aura types being excluded before calling this method. Also, be aware that removing
    auras might affect combat state or other game mechanics depending on the context.
