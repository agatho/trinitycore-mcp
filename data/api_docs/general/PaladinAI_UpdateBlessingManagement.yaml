documentation:
  brief: Manages the application and updating of blessings for the paladin AI.
  description: The UpdateBlessingManagement method is responsible for handling the
    logic related to applying, refreshing, and maintaining blessings on the paladin's
    target or self. This includes checking if a blessing is currently active, determining
    whether it needs to be refreshed based on duration or debuffs, and selecting the
    appropriate blessing to apply based on the current combat situation and spell
    availability. The method integrates with the AI's decision-making process to ensure
    optimal use of blessing spells for maximizing the paladin's effectiveness in both
    single-target and area-of-effect scenarios.

    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateBlessingManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked after checking for valid targets and spell readiness. It assumes that
    the paladin has access to blessing spells and that the target or self is within
    appropriate range for applying blessings.
  warnings: Ensure that the paladin's spell list contains valid blessing spells before
    calling this method, otherwise it may result in no blessing being applied. Also,
    be aware that frequent calls without proper cooldown handling could lead to inefficient
    resource usage.
