  class: Guild
  method: SendBankLog
  signature: void Guild::SendBankLog(WorldSession * session, uint8 tabId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends the guild bank log for a specified tab to the player's session.
  description: The SendBankLog method retrieves and sends the transaction history
    of the guild bank for a given tab to the specified WorldSession. This functionality
    allows players to view recent actions such as item deposits, withdrawals, and
    modifications within the guild bank. The method is typically invoked when a player
    opens the guild bank interface or requests to see the log for a specific tab.
    It ensures that only authorized guild members can access this information based
    on their permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player requesting the guild bank
      log. This session is used to send the log data back to the client.
  - name: tabId
    description: The identifier of the guild bank tab for which the log should be
      retrieved and sent. Valid values are typically 0-6, corresponding to the different
      tabs in the guild bank interface.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send Bank Log for Tab 0
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendBankLog(player->GetSession(),\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send Bank Log Based on User Input
    code: "uint8 tabId = 3; // Assume this value comes from user input\nWorldSession*\
      \ session = player->GetSession();\nif (session && player->GetGuild())\n{\n \
      \   player->GetGuild()->SendBankLog(session, tabId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal guild bank logging mechanisms and assumes
    that the guild has a valid bank log structure. It is important to ensure that
    the session is valid and the player has sufficient permissions to view the requested
    tab's log.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the player's guild membership or
    permissions may result in unauthorized access to guild bank logs. Ensure proper
    checks are performed before invoking this method.
