  brief: Initializes a new CombatMetrics instance with default values
  description: The CombatMetrics constructor initializes a new combat metrics object,
    setting up internal tracking structures for player combat statistics. This method
    is typically called when creating a new combat metrics record for a player or
    creature during combat analysis. The constructor establishes baseline values for
    tracking damage dealt, received, healing done, and other combat-related statistics.
    It prepares the object for subsequent updates during combat events without requiring
    additional initialization steps.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new CombatMetrics instance
    code: 'CombatMetrics* metrics = new CombatMetrics();

      // The metrics object is now initialized and ready for combat tracking'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or external API
    calls. It only initializes internal data structures. The CombatMetrics class is
    typically used in conjunction with combat event handlers to track player performance
    during encounters.
