documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the priority of a loot item for the group coordinator's loot distribution
    strategy
  description: The EvaluateLootItem method determines the appropriate LootPriority
    level for a given item ID within the context of the group coordinator's loot distribution
    system. This method is typically invoked during loot evaluation phases to assess
    how important or desirable a particular item is for the group, considering factors
    such as player roles, gear requirements, and current loot rules. The method does
    not modify any state but returns a priority value that can be used by the loot
    distribution logic to make decisions about item assignment. It operates on the
    item ID directly without requiring additional context parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a LootPriority enum value indicating the evaluated priority of
    the item. Possible values typically include LOOT_PRIORITY_NONE, LOOT_PRIORITY_LOW,
    LOOT_PRIORITY_MEDIUM, LOOT_PRIORITY_HIGH, or LOOT_PRIORITY_ULTRA, representing
    different levels of desirability or necessity for the group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot evaluation
    code: "LootPriority priority = groupCoordinator->EvaluateLootItem(12345);\nif\
      \ (priority >= LOOT_PRIORITY_HIGH)\n{\n    // Item is considered highly desirable\n\
      \    // Proceed with high-priority loot distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal lookups against configured loot rules
    or item databases. It may be called frequently during group loot sessions, so
    performance considerations should be taken into account for large item sets. The
    method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify any member variables
    of the GroupCoordinator class.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter corresponds to an actual item in the
    game database; invalid item IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    priority evaluations. This method assumes proper initialization of loot rules
    and group context.
