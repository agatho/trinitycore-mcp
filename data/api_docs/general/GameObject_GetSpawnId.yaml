  method: GetSpawnId
  signature: int GameObject::GetSpawnId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spawn ID associated with this game object instance.
  description: The GetSpawnId method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to the spawn point or spawn group from which this GameObject was created. In TrinityCore,
    each GameObject is linked to a specific spawn entry in the database, and this
    spawn ID represents that relationship. The returned value typically maps to entries
    in tables such as `gameobject_spawns` or related spawn management systems within
    the core. This identifier can be used for tracking, debugging, or implementing
    logic that depends on spawn-specific behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spawn ID of this GameObject instance. A value
    of 0 may indicate an invalid or unspawned state depending on the context and implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Spawn ID
    code: "GameObject* go = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_ID_SOME_OBJECT, 10.0f);\n\
      if (go)\n{\n    int spawnId = go->GetSpawnId();\n    if (spawnId > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Use spawnId for further logic\n        sLog->outString(\"GameObject\
      \ spawned with ID: %d\", spawnId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GameObject has been properly initialized and
    linked to a valid spawn entry. If the object was dynamically created without proper
    spawning, the returned value might not reflect an actual database record.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this ID for operations that assume persistence
    across server restarts or migrations; spawn IDs may change between sessions in
    some configurations.
