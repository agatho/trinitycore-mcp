  class: RenewTracker
  method: ApplyRenew
  signature: void RenewTracker::ApplyRenew(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Renew effect to a player with the specified GUID for the given
    duration.
  description: The ApplyRenew method is used to apply a Renew spell effect to a player
    character identified by their GUID. This method typically manages the application
    of healing-over-time effects, such as the Renew spell from World of Warcraft's
    priest class. The duration parameter controls how long the renew effect will last.
    This method likely interacts with the player's aura system and may update their
    active spell effects or buffs. It is commonly used in spell handling systems within
    TrinityCore to manage periodic healing effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player character who will receive
      the Renew effect. This should be a valid player GUID from the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Renew effect will remain
      active. This determines how long the periodic healing will occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RenewTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyRenew(12345, 10000); // Apply renew to player with GUID 12345 for
      10 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Dynamic Duration
    code: 'uint32 duration = 5000 + (GetRandomInt(5000)); // Random duration between
      5-10 seconds

      tracker.ApplyRenew(playerGuid, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal tracking structures for active renew
    effects. It may trigger notifications to the client about spell application and
    could interact with combat log systems. The method should be called on the correct
    thread context (typically the world thread) to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter refers to an actual player in the game
    world, otherwise behavior is undefined. Calling this method with a duration of
    zero or negative values may cause unexpected behavior in the aura system.
