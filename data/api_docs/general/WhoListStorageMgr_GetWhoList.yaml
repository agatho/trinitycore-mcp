documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the internal vector of who list information
    entries.
  description: The GetWhoList method provides access to the complete collection of
    who list entries stored within the WhoListStorageMgr instance. This method is
    typically used by the server to retrieve all currently available who list data
    that can be sent to players or processed for various game mechanics such as player
    lookup and visibility systems. The returned reference points to an internal data
    structure, so modifications to the vector through this reference will affect the
    stored data directly. No parameters are required for this method, and it is designed
    to be a read-only accessor for the who list information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a WhoListInfoVector containing all who list entries
    currently managed by the WhoListStorageMgr instance. This vector holds structured
    data about players visible in the who list system, including their names, levels,
    classes, zones, and other relevant status information.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through who list
    code: "WhoListStorageMgr& storage = WhoListStorageMgr::instance();\nconst WhoListInfoVector&\
      \ whoList = storage.GetWhoList();\nfor (const auto& entry : whoList)\n{\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"Player: \" << entry.playerName << \" (Level \" << entry.level\
      \ << \")\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the caller cannot modify
    the underlying vector. The returned data is only valid while the WhoListStorageMgr
    instance remains alive and has not been modified by other operations. This method
    does not perform any locking or synchronization internally, so if used from multiple
    threads, external synchronization may be required.
