  class: EvokerAI
  method: IsChannelingEmpoweredSpell
  signature: bool EvokerAI::IsChannelingEmpoweredSpell()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the evoker is currently channeling an empowered spell.
  description: This method determines whether the EvokerAI instance is currently engaged
    in channeling a spell that has been empowered, typically through abilities like
    Empower or similar mechanics. It evaluates the current state of the AI's spellcasting
    behavior and returns true if an empowered channeling spell is active, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for managing spell priorities, cooldowns, and ensuring
    proper behavior during empowered spell phases in the evoker's combat routine.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the evoker is currently channeling an empowered spell;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check channeling state
    code: "if (evokerAI->IsChannelingEmpoweredSpell())\n{\n    // Handle logic when\
      \ evoker is channeling empowered spell\n    evokerAI->DoWork();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell decision making
    code: "if (!evokerAI->IsChannelingEmpoweredSpell() && evokerAI->GetTarget())\n\
      {\n    // Only cast non-channeling spells when not channeling empowered ones\n\
      \    evokerAI->CastSpell(evokerAI->GetTarget(), SPELL_EMPOWERED_BREATH);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the AI's spellcasting behavior.
    It should be called frequently during the AI update cycle to ensure accurate detection
    of channeling states. The implementation may depend on specific flags or internal
    variables set by other methods in the EvokerAI class.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not used in contexts where it might interfere
    with spell queue management or cause race conditions. Avoid calling this method
    during spell initialization or destruction phases to prevent inconsistent state
    reporting.
