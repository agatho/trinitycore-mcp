documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat behavior integration object for the AI instance
  description: The GetCombatBehaviors method returns a constant pointer to a CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object that defines the combat behaviors and decision-making logic for this AI
    instance. This integration contains all the necessary data structures and functions
    that govern how the AI unit engages in combat, including target selection, spell
    casting, movement patterns, and tactical decisions. The returned pointer is valid
    for the lifetime of the ClassAI instance and should not be modified or deleted
    by callers. This method is typically used internally by the AI system to access
    behavior configurations during combat state evaluation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a CombatBehaviorIntegration object that contains
    all combat behavior definitions for this AI unit, or nullptr if no combat behaviors
    are configured
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access combat behaviors
    code: "ClassAI* ai = unit->GetAI();\nconst CombatBehaviorIntegration* behaviors\
      \ = ai->GetCombatBehaviors();\nif (behaviors)\n{\n    // Use the combat behaviors\
      \ for custom AI logic\n    behaviors->UpdateCombatState(unit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if combat behaviors exist before using them
    code: "ClassAI* ai = unit->GetAI();\nconst CombatBehaviorIntegration* behaviors\
      \ = ai->GetCombatBehaviors();\nif (behaviors != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to\
      \ use the behaviors\n    uint32 spellId = behaviors->GetNextSpellToCast(unit);\n\
      \    if (spellId)\n    {\n        unit->CastSpell(unit->GetVictim(), spellId,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no combat behaviors are\
      \ defined\n    unit->AttackStop();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatBehaviorIntegration object is owned by the ClassAI instance
    and should not be modified. The method performs no locking or synchronization,
    so access should be coordinated with the AI's internal thread safety mechanisms.
    This method may return nullptr if the AI unit has not been properly initialized
    with combat behaviors.
  warnings: Never attempt to delete or modify the returned CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object as it is managed by the ClassAI instance. Calling this method on a unit
    that hasn't been initialized with proper AI behavior configuration may result
    in a null pointer dereference if not properly checked.
