  method: GenerateCircleFormation
  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateCircleFormation(uint32 memberCount, float
    spacing) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal circular formation layout for a group
    of members based on specified spacing.
  description: The GenerateCircleFormation method computes a circular arrangement
    of group members, positioning them evenly around a central point. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage player positioning
    during group activities such as raids or dungeons. The method takes into account
    the number of members and desired spacing between them to determine their individual
    coordinates. It ensures that the formation maintains visual symmetry and proper
    distribution across the circular layout. The returned integer value indicates
    success or failure of the operation, with positive values generally representing
    successful placements and negative values indicating errors such as invalid member
    counts or insufficient space.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of group members to position in the circle. Must
      be a positive integer greater than zero.
  - name: spacing
    description: The angular spacing (in radians) between each member along the circular
      formation. Should be a positive floating-point value representing the angle
      increment.
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the result of the operation: 0 for success,
    negative values for errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient space to
    form the circle.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Circle Formation Generation
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nint result = formation.GenerateCircleFormation(5,\
      \ 1.256f); // 5 members with ~72-degree spacing\nif (result >= 0) {\n    //\
      \ Formation successfully generated\n    printf(\"Circle formation created with\
      \ %d members\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to generate circle formation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Circle Formation for Raid Setup
    code: "GroupFormation raidFormation;\nuint32 players = 8;\nfloat radius = 2.0f;\n\
      int status = raidFormation.GenerateCircleFormation(players, 0.785f); // ~45-degree\
      \ spacing\nif (status == 0) {\n    // Proceed with positioning players in the\
      \ circle\n    printf(\"Raid circle formation ready for %d players\\n\", players);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log error and fall back to default formation\n    printf(\"\
      Error generating raid circle: %d\\n\", status);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are already registered within
    the GroupFormation context. The spacing parameter controls how tightly packed
    the members are in the circular layout; smaller values result in tighter formations
    while larger values spread them out more. Performance is optimized for small to
    medium-sized groups (up to ~20 members).
  warnings: Ensure that memberCount is a valid positive integer and that spacing is
    not zero or negative, as this may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning.
    Do not call this method without first ensuring the group has been initialized
    properly.
