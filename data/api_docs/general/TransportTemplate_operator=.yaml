  brief: Moves a TransportTemplate object to another TransportTemplate object, transferring
    all owned resources and leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for TransportTemplate performs a move
    operation, transferring ownership of all resources from the source TransportTemplate
    to the target. This is an efficient way to reassign one TransportTemplate instance
    to another without copying data. The source object becomes left in a valid but
    unspecified state after the operation. In the context of TrinityCore's transport
    system, this operator allows for efficient management of transport templates during
    loading, unloading, and dynamic modification of transport systems like boats or
    elevators within the game world. This method is typically used internally by the
    core engine when managing collections or containers of TransportTemplate objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target TransportTemplate object after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'TransportTemplate template1;

      TransportTemplate template2 = std::move(template1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      template1 = std::move(template2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<TransportTemplate> templates;

      TransportTemplate newTemplate;

      // ... populate newTemplate ...

      templates.push_back(std::move(newTemplate)); // Efficiently moves template into
      vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be used
    with caution when dealing with objects that have complex internal state. The source
    object after a move operation should not be used until it's reassigned or explicitly
    reset, as its state becomes undefined but valid.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not accessed after being moved from
    unless it has been properly reassigned. This is especially important in multi-threaded
    contexts where move operations may introduce race conditions if not properly synchronized.
