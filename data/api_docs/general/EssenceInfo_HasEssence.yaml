documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a specific essence assigned to their character.
  description: The HasEssence method determines whether a player's character possesses
    a particular essence, identified by its unique ID. This functionality is typically
    used in conjunction with the essence system within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, where essences represent powerful magical resources that players can
    acquire and utilize for various purposes such as enchanting items or enhancing
    abilities. The method evaluates the internal state of the EssenceInfo object to
    verify if the specified essence is present among those assigned to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: required
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific essence to check
      for. This value corresponds to a unique ID defined within the game's essence
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified essence is found in the player's assigned
    essences; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetEssenceInfo()->HasEssence(12345)) {\n    // Player has essence\
      \ with ID 12345\n    // Perform action related to having this essence\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Essence Presence
    code: "EssenceInfo* info = player->GetEssenceInfo();\nif (info->HasEssence(98765))\
      \ {\n    // Grant access to a special ability or item\n    player->AddItem(45678,\
      \ 1);\n} else {\n    // Inform player they lack the required essence\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not possess the necessary essence.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of essences assigned to a character.
    It is important to ensure that the provided ID corresponds to an actual essence
    defined in the game's data files. The implementation may involve lookups within
    collections or arrays, so performance should be considered when calling this method
    frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'required' parameter is validated before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior due to invalid essence IDs. Also, be aware
    that this method does not modify any state; it only performs a read operation
    on the essence data.
