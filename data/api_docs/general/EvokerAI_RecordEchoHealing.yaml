  signature: void EvokerAI::RecordEchoHealing(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Records healing amount for Echo ability tracking in Evoker AI.
  description: The RecordEchoHealing method is used within the EvokerAI class to log
    and track the amount of healing performed by the Evoker's Echo ability. This method
    likely updates internal statistics or counters related to the Echo spell's effectiveness,
    which may be used for various game mechanics such as cooldown adjustments, damage
    scaling, or performance metrics. The method accepts an integer representing the
    healing amount and stores this value for potential future use in AI decision-making
    or logging systems. It is typically called when a healing event occurs from the
    Echo ability to maintain accurate tracking of the Evoker's healing contributions.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The integer amount of healing performed by the Echo ability. This
      value represents the total healing points or damage reduction applied to targets
      during an Echo healing event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Event Recording
    code: "void OnHealEvent(Unit* target, int healAmount) {\n    if (target && target->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_PLAYER) {\n        // Record healing from Echo ability\n       \
      \ RecordEchoHealing(healAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_echoHealingTotal > 1000) {\n        // Trigger special behavior when\
      \ Echo healing exceeds threshold\n        RecordEchoHealing(500);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that tracks spell usage and
    effectiveness for Evoker class AI. The recorded healing amounts may be used to
    influence future spell selection or cooldown timing. Implementation details suggest
    this method may interact with internal tracking variables or databases within
    the EvokerAI class.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is always a positive integer representing
    actual healing done, as negative values could cause unexpected behavior in tracking
    systems. This method should only be called during valid healing events to maintain
    accurate statistics.
