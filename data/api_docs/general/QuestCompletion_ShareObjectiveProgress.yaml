  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ShareObjectiveProgress
  signature: void QuestCompletion::ShareObjectiveProgress(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Shares quest objective progress with all members of a group.
  description: The ShareObjectiveProgress method synchronizes the current quest progress
    for a specified quest ID among all players within a given group. This ensures
    that all group members have consistent information about their shared quest objectives,
    which is essential for cooperative gameplay and quest completion tracking. The
    method typically updates the quest log and objective counters for each group member
    to reflect the same progress state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest progress
      will be synchronized. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which objective progress is
      being shared. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Share Quest Progress with Group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::ShareObjectiveProgress(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all group members and sends updated quest
    progress data to each player's client. It may also trigger internal quest state
    updates on the server side.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
