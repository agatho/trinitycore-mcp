  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: DeclineInvitation
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::DeclineInvitation(int inviterGuid, const
    std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Declines a group invitation from another player, optionally providing a reason
    for the decline.
  description: The GroupInvitationHandler::DeclineInvitation method handles the logic
    for rejecting an incoming group invitation. When invoked, it removes the invitation
    from the system and notifies the inviter that the invitation has been declined.
    This method is typically called when a player chooses not to join a group, either
    by clicking decline in the UI or through automated systems. The reason parameter
    allows for optional feedback to be sent back to the inviter, which can be useful
    for debugging or user experience improvements. The method does not return any
    value and operates on the current player's invitation state.
  parameters:
  - name: inviterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the
      group invitation. This is used to locate and remove the specific invitation
      from the system.
  - name: reason
    description: An optional string explaining why the invitation was declined. This
      can be used for logging, debugging, or providing feedback to the inviter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decline an invitation without a reason
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.DeclineInvitation(123456, "");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Decline an invitation with a reason
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.DeclineInvitation(789012, "Not interested in this group");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has received and is acting upon an invitation.
    It does not validate whether the invitation actually exists or is still valid
    before declining. The method should be called only when the player is certain
    they want to decline the invitation.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviterGuid corresponds to a valid player who sent a real
    invitation. Passing invalid GUIDs may lead to unexpected behavior in the invitation
    system. Also, note that this method does not prevent other players from sending
    new invitations after declining.
