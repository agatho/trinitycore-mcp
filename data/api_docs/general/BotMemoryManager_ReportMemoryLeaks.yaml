  brief: Reports memory leak information for bot memory management
  description: The ReportMemoryLeaks method outputs detailed information about memory
    allocations and potential leaks within the bot memory management system. This
    method is typically invoked during shutdown or debugging to identify memory usage
    patterns and detect any unreleased memory blocks that may indicate memory leaks.
    It provides diagnostic data useful for developers and administrators to maintain
    optimal performance and stability of bot systems in TrinityCore environments.

  notes: This method should only be called when the bot system is in a stable state
    or during shutdown to avoid interference with active memory operations. It may
    produce verbose output depending on the debug level configured in the TrinityCore
    environment.
