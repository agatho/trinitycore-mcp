  signature: void Player::AddSpellCategoryCooldownMod(int32 spellCategoryId, int32
    mod)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a cooldown modifier to a spell category for the player.
  description: This method modifies the cooldown time for all spells belonging to
    a specific category for the player. It allows developers to adjust cooldown durations
    dynamically, which is useful for implementing custom game mechanics or balancing
    spell cooldowns. The method operates on the player's internal cooldown system
    and affects how quickly spells from the specified category can be used again after
    casting.
  parameters:
  - name: spellCategoryId
    description: The category ID of the spells to modify cooldown for. This is typically
      a numeric identifier that groups related spells together in the game's spell
      system.
  - name: mod
    description: The cooldown modifier value to apply. Positive values reduce cooldown
      time, while negative values increase it. This value is applied as a percentage
      or absolute time depending on how the cooldown system handles the modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddSpellCategoryCooldownMod(123, 50); // Reduce cooldown by 50%

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int32 categoryId = 456;

      int32 modifier = -20;

      player->AddSpellCategoryCooldownMod(categoryId, modifier); // Increase cooldown
      by 20%

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cooldown-related
    methods to manage spell timing. It should be called carefully as it affects the
    player's ability to cast spells efficiently. The modification may be applied immediately
    or delayed depending on how the system handles cooldown updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when applying negative modifiers, as they can significantly
    increase cooldown times and potentially affect gameplay balance. Also, ensure
    that the category ID is valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
