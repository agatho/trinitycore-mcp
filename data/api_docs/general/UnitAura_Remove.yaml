  class: UnitAura
  method: Remove
  signature: void UnitAura::Remove(AuraRemoveMode removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the aura from the unit with the specified removal mode.
  description: The Remove method is used to remove an aura from a Unit object. It
    takes an AuraRemoveMode parameter that determines how the aura should be removed,
    such as by expiration, cancellation, or application of a new aura. This method
    handles the proper cleanup and notification of systems affected by the aura removal.
    The removal process may trigger callbacks, update unit state, and send relevant
    packets to clients. The method is typically called internally by the core system
    when an aura's duration expires or when it is explicitly removed by another effect.
  parameters:
  - name: removeMode
    description: Specifies how the aura should be removed. Valid values include AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT,
      AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE, AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL, AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL, AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEATH,
      and others. This determines which handlers are notified and what kind of visual
      or gameplay effects occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove aura by expiration
    code: "UnitAura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove aura on death
    code: "UnitAura* aura = unit->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEATH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly from outside the core system unless
    you are certain about the removal mode and its implications. The aura's removal
    may trigger additional logic such as spell effects, debuff refreshes, or stat
    recalculations. Be aware that removing an aura can cause cascading effects in
    the game state.
  warnings: Calling Remove on an already removed aura can lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the aura is valid and active before calling this method. Improper
    use of removal modes may result in visual glitches, incorrect stat calculations,
    or client-side desynchronization.
