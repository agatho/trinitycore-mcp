  method: GetSpellMechanicType
  signature: MechanicType MechanicAwareness::GetSpellMechanicType(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mechanic type associated with a specified spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellMechanicType method is used to determine the mechanic type
    of a given spell in the TrinityCore framework. This functionality is essential
    for handling spell interactions, effects, and mechanics such as stun, fear, root,
    and other game-defined categories that influence how spells behave and interact
    with game objects or creatures. The method typically accesses internal spell data
    structures to map spell identifiers to their corresponding mechanic types, which
    are defined in the game's spell database. It is commonly used in spell handling
    systems, combat logic, and AI decision-making processes where understanding a
    spell's mechanic is crucial for proper gameplay behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MechanicType enum value that represents the mechanic category
    of the specified spell. Possible values include common mechanics like MECHANIC_STUN,
    MECHANIC_FEAR, MECHANIC_ROOT, etc., depending on how the spell is defined in the
    game's spell database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nMechanicType mechanic = awareness.GetSpellMechanicType(spellId);\n\
      if (mechanic == MECHANIC_STUN)\n{\n    // Handle stun mechanic logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached spell data and may involve database lookups
    or internal caches. It's recommended to cache results if the same spell IDs are
    queried repeatedly during combat or AI processing for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId is valid and exists in the game's spell
    database; invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect mechanic
    types being returned.
