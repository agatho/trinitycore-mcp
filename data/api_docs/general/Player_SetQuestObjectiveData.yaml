documentation:
  brief: Sets quest objective data for a player's current quest
  description: This method updates the quest objective data associated with a specific
    objective in the player's active quest. It allows developers to modify the progress
    or status of a quest objective, typically used during quest completion or progression
    events. The method is part of the core quest system implementation and affects
    how quest objectives are tracked and displayed to players.
  parameters:
  - name: objective
    description: The quest objective identifier that needs to be updated. This represents
      a specific objective within the current quest being tracked by the player.
  - name: data
    description: The data value to set for the specified objective. This can represent
      various values such as progress, completion status, or other objective-specific
      information depending on the quest type and implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int32 questProgress = 100;

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the quest tracking
    system. It is typically called during quest completion or progression events where
    player progress needs to be updated. The method is part of the core quest system
    and should not be used outside of proper quest handling contexts.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest progress tracking,
    potentially causing quests to appear stuck or incomplete. It should only be called
    when there's a valid reason for updating quest objective data, such as during
    quest completion or progression events.
