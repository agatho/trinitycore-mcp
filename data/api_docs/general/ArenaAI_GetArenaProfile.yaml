  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetArenaProfile
  signature: ArenaProfile ArenaAI::GetArenaProfile(uint32 playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena profile data for a specified player GUID within the ArenaAI
    system.
  description: The GetArenaProfile method fetches the detailed arena profile information
    associated with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically
    used in the context of battleground and arena management within TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It allows access to player-specific arena statistics, rankings,
    and performance metrics that are stored and managed by the ArenaAI system. The
    method operates on a const object, indicating it does not modify internal state
    but rather retrieves existing data. This function is essential for systems that
    need to evaluate or display player arena performance in real-time during matches
    or post-match analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ArenaProfile object containing the complete profile information
    for the specified player GUID, including statistics, ratings, and performance
    data relevant to arena gameplay. If no profile exists for the given GUID, the
    method may return a default-initialized ArenaProfile object with all fields set
    to zero or empty values.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Arena Profile for Player
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 12345;\nArenaProfile profile = arenaAI->GetArenaProfile(playerGuid);\n\
      if (profile.IsValid()) {\n    // Use profile data for display or processing\n\
      \    uint32 rating = profile.GetRating();\n    uint32 wins = profile.GetWins();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ArenaAI system has already initialized and populated
    arena profiles for players. The returned ArenaProfile object should be checked
    for validity before accessing its data to avoid potential access violations or
    incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    player who has participated in arena matches; otherwise, the returned profile
    may be invalid or contain default values. This function should not be called during
    critical sections where arena data might be concurrently modified.
