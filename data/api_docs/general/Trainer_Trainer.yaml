    std::vector<Spell> spells)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a trainer with specified ID, type, greeting, and spell list for
    player interaction.
  description: The Trainer constructor initializes a trainer object with a unique
    identifier, training type, greeting message, and a collection of spells that the
    trainer can teach. This method sets up the core properties needed for a trainer
    to function within the World of Warcraft environment. The trainer's behavior and
    available training options are determined by these parameters. This initialization
    is typically called when creating or loading trainer NPCs in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the trainer NPC. Must be a valid entry ID from
      the creature_template table.
  - name: type
    description: 'Type of trainer indicating what kind of skills or spells they can
      teach. Valid values include: TRADE_SKILLS, PET_TRAINER, and others defined in
      the Type enum.'
  - name: greeting
    description: Greeting message displayed to players when interacting with the trainer.
      Can be an empty string if no greeting is desired.
  - name: spells
    description: Vector of Spell objects representing the spells available for training.
      Each spell must have valid data and be properly configured for the trainer's
      type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trainer Initialization
    code: Trainer trainer(3456, Type::TRADE_SKILLS, "Welcome to my shop!", {Spell(1234),
      Spell(5678)});
    language: cpp
  - title: Pet Trainer Setup
    code: Trainer petTrainer(9876, Type::PET_TRAINER, "I can teach you about pets.",
      {Spell(1001), Spell(1002)});
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during NPC creation or loading from database.
    The spell list should contain valid spell entries that match the trainer's type
    to ensure proper functionality in-game. Trainers must be registered with the appropriate
    system to become interactable by players.
  warnings: Incorrect spell IDs or invalid trainer types may cause runtime errors
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure all parameters are validated before calling this
    method, especially when loading trainers from external data sources.
