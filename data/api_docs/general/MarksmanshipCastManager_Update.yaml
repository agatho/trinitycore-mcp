  class: MarksmanshipCastManager
  method: Update
  signature: void MarksmanshipCastManager::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the marksmanship cast manager's internal state and handles ongoing
    casting operations for marksmanship specializations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the state of marksmanship-related
    casting mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. It processes active casts,
    checks for interruptions or completion conditions, and ensures proper synchronization
    between the player's marksmanship abilities and game mechanics. This method typically
    runs in the game loop and handles time-based updates for abilities such as Aimed
    Shot, Steady Shot, and other marksmanship-specific spells that require ongoing
    casting or channeling. The implementation may include logic for handling focus
    costs, cooldowns, and maintaining proper spell state during extended casting periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'MarksmanshipCastManager manager;

      manager.Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop and should
    not be invoked directly by external systems without proper context. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific marksmanship specialization being managed (e.g.,
    Beast Mastery, Marksmanship, Survival).
