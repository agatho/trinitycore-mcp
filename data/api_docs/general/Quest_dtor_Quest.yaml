  brief: Destroys a Quest object and releases its resources
  description: The Quest destructor is responsible for cleaning up memory and resources
    associated with a quest instance. It ensures that all allocated memory is properly
    freed and that any internal references to the quest are removed. This method is
    automatically called when a quest object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted,
    preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper game state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest destruction
    code: 'Quest* quest = new Quest();

      // ... do something with quest

      delete quest;

      // Quest destructor automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically invoked by the game engine when quest objects
    are removed from memory. It's important to note that this method should not be
    called directly in most cases, as it's handled automatically by the system.
  warnings: Improper handling of quest objects can lead to memory leaks or crashes
    if the destructor is not properly invoked. Avoid calling this method manually
    unless explicitly required.
