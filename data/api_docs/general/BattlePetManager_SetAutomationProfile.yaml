  class: BattlePetManager
  method: SetAutomationProfile
  signature: void BattlePetManager::SetAutomationProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const
    PetBattleAutomationProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the automation profile for a player's battle pet team.
  description: The SetAutomationProfile method configures the automated behavior settings
    for a specific player's battle pet team. This method allows the game to define
    how pet battles should be handled automatically, including actions like switching
    pets, using abilities, and managing battle strategies. The automation profile
    is typically used in conjunction with the BattlePet system to provide AI-driven
    pet battle management for players who prefer automated gameplay or are unable
    to manually control their pets during battles.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose automation profile
      is being set. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: The PetBattleAutomationProfile object containing the automation settings
      for the player's battle pets. This includes rules for pet switching, ability
      usage, and battle strategy decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Automation Profile
    code: "PetBattleAutomationProfile profile;\nprofile.autoSwitchPets = true;\nprofile.useAbilities\
      \ = true;\nprofile.strategy = PetBattleStrategy::Aggressive;\n battlePetManager->SetAutomationProfile(12345,\
      \ profile);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Advanced Battle Strategy
    code: 'PetBattleAutomationProfile advancedProfile;

      advancedProfile.autoSwitchPets = false;

      advancedProfile.useAbilities = true;

      advancedProfile.strategy = PetBattleStrategy::Defensive;

      advancedProfile.maxEnergyUsage = 80;

      advancedProfile.minHealthThreshold = 30;

      battlePetManager->SetAutomationProfile(playerGuid, advancedProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates the player's automation settings in the database
    or in-memory cache. The profile data should be validated before setting to ensure
    it contains valid values for all fields. This method is typically called during
    player initialization, when changing automation preferences, or when loading saved
    battle pet settings.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid playerGuid may result in undefined
    behavior or database corruption. Ensure that the PetBattleAutomationProfile object
    is properly initialized and validated before passing it to this method. The profile
    settings should be carefully considered as they directly affect gameplay experience
    during pet battles.
