documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction house market data with current item listings and pricing
    information.
  description: The UpdateMarketData method refreshes the internal state of the auction
    house by retrieving and processing current item listings, prices, and availability
    from the game database. This method ensures that the auction house displays up-to-date
    information to players, including bid prices, buyout amounts, and item quantities.
    It typically runs periodically or in response to specific events such as new auctions
    being created or existing ones being finalized. The method handles synchronization
    between the server's data store and the auction house's in-memory representation.

  notes: This method may cause performance overhead during high-traffic periods as
    it processes potentially large numbers of auction items. It is typically called
    by the game's main update loop or triggered by database synchronization events.
