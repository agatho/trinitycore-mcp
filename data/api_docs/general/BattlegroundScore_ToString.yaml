  brief: Converts battleground score data into a human-readable string format
  description: The ToString method serializes the battleground score information into
    a formatted string representation. This method is typically used for debugging,
    logging, or displaying player performance statistics during or after battleground
    encounters. The output string contains key metrics such as kills, deaths, honor
    gained, and other relevant battleground statistics. It provides a convenient way
    to inspect or transmit score data without requiring direct access to individual
    score components.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted battleground score information,
    including player performance metrics in a readable format
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: 'BattlegroundScore score;

      // ... populate score with data ...

      std::string scoreString = score.ToString();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bg", "Player score: %s", scoreString.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Score Data
    code: "BattlegroundScore* playerScore = GetPlayerScore(playerGuid);\nif (playerScore)\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"bg\", \"Current score: %s\", playerScore->ToString().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    The exact format of the returned string may vary between different battleground
    types or game versions. The implementation likely uses standard formatting techniques
    to ensure consistent output across different score configurations.
