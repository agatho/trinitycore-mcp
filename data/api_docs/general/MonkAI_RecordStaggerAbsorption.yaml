  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordStaggerAbsorption
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordStaggerAbsorption(int damage)
documentation:
  brief: Records the amount of damage absorbed by the Monk's Stagger effect.
  description: The RecordStaggerAbsorption method is used to track and update the
    amount of damage that has been absorbed by a Monk character's Stagger mechanic.
    This method is typically called when the Monk takes damage that is partially or
    fully absorbed by their Stagger ability, which reduces incoming damage over time.
    The method updates internal tracking variables to reflect the new absorption value,
    potentially affecting the Monk's stagger state and cooldowns. It plays a crucial
    role in maintaining accurate game state for the Monk's defensive abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: damage
    description: The amount of damage that was absorbed by the Stagger effect. This
      should be a non-negative integer representing the damage value that was mitigated
      by the Monk's stagger ability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void HandleDamageTaken(Unit* attacker, uint32 damage)\n{\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = attacker->ToPlayer())\n    {\n        if (MonkAI* monkAI = dynamic_cast<MonkAI*>(player->GetAI()))\n\
      \        {\n            monkAI->RecordStaggerAbsorption(damage);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void CombatManager::ApplyDamageReduction(Unit* target, uint32& damage)\n\
      {\n    if (target->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n    {\n        Player* player\
      \ = target->ToPlayer();\n        if (player->getClass() == CLASS_MONK)\n   \
      \     {\n            MonkAI* monkAI = dynamic_cast<MonkAI*>(player->GetAI());\n\
      \            if (monkAI && damage > 0)\n            {\n                uint32\
      \ absorbed = monkAI->RecordStaggerAbsorption(damage);\n                damage\
      \ -= absorbed;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Monk actually has Stagger active
    and is absorbing damage. The implementation likely updates internal stagger counters
    and may trigger stagger-related cooldowns or effects. It's important to ensure
    that this method is not called with negative damage values, as it could lead to
    incorrect state tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the Monk has an active Stagger
    effect may result in incorrect game state. Additionally, if the damage parameter
    exceeds the maximum stagger capacity, unexpected behavior may occur. Always validate
    that the target is a Monk and that the AI is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
