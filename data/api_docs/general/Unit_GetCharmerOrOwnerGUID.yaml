  method: GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID
  signature: int Unit::GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the unit's charmer or owner, if applicable.
  description: The GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the creature or player that owns or controls the current unit. This method
    is commonly used in the context of pet AI and summoning mechanics within World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It returns a GUID value representing either
    the charmer (if the unit was summoned by another unit) or the owner (if the unit
    has an owner). The method is particularly useful when determining the relationship
    between summoned creatures and their summoner, or when checking if a unit has
    an owner in the context of pet AI.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the charmer or owner. If the unit does not have a charmer
    or owner, this method returns 0. The GUID represents either the player or creature
    that summoned or owns the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nuint64 guid = unit->GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID();\n\
      if (guid != 0)\n{\n    // The unit has a charmer or owner\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nuint64 guid = unit->GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID();\n\
      if (guid != 0)\n{\n    // Check if the unit is a pet\n    Player* owner = ObjectAccessor::GetObjectInWorld<Player>(guid);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Unit has no charmer or owner\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used with caution as it may return 0 for units without
    a charmer or owner. The method is typically used in conjunction with other methods
    like GetCharmerGUID or GetOwnerGUID to determine the relationship between units
    and their summoner or owner.
  warnings: This method might return 0 even if the unit has an owner, particularly
    when dealing with non-player controlled units. Care should be taken when using
    this method in AI contexts where the unit's relationship to its owner or charmer
    is critical for behavior.
