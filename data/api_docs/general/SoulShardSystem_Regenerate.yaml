documentation:
  brief: Regenerates soul shard resources for a player over time.
  description: The Regenerate method handles the automatic replenishment of soul shards
    in the SoulShardSystem. This method is typically called periodically by the game
    engine to simulate the natural regeneration of soul shards, which are used by
    warlocks for various abilities. The regeneration process considers the elapsed
    time since the last update and applies appropriate scaling based on player state,
    such as whether they are in combat or resting. It ensures that players can gradually
    restore their soul shard resources without manual intervention.

  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'SoulShardSystem* system = player->GetSoulShardSystem();

      uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      system->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly with accurate time deltas to ensure
    proper regeneration behavior. The internal logic may adjust regeneration rates
    based on player conditions like being in combat or resting.
