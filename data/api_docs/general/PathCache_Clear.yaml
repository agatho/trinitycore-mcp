documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached paths from the PathCache instance
  description: The Clear method removes all path entries from the PathCache, effectively
    invalidating any previously computed navigation paths. This method is typically
    invoked when the cache needs to be refreshed due to map changes, object movement,
    or when the system requires a clean slate for pathfinding operations. The operation
    is performed in O(n) time where n is the number of cached paths. No parameters
    are required as the method operates on the instance's internal data structure.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathCache cache;

      // ... populate cache with paths ...

      cache.Clear(); // Clear all cached paths'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    clearing the entire cache may cause a temporary spike in pathfinding computation
    time. It's recommended to only call Clear() when necessary, such as after significant
    map modifications or when switching zones.
