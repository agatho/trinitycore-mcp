documentation:
  brief: Completes an arena game and updates team statistics accordingly
  description: The FinishGame method finalizes an ongoing arena match by processing
    the results, updating player and team statistics, and handling reward distribution.
    This method is typically invoked when an arena match concludes, whether through
    victory, defeat, or draw conditions. It adjusts rating values, win/loss records,
    and other arena-related metrics for all participating players. The method ensures
    that arena team integrity is maintained by properly recording match outcomes and
    updating player rankings within the game's competitive system.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: Modifier value that influences rating changes and game outcome calculations.
      Positive values typically indicate winning conditions, while negative values
      suggest losses or draws. The exact interpretation may depend on internal arena
      match logic and team composition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Match End
    code: "void OnArenaMatchEnd(ArenaTeam* team, bool victory)\n{\n    int32 modifier\
      \ = victory ? 10 : -10;\n    team->FinishGame(modifier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Team Statistics After Match
    code: "void HandleArenaVictory(ArenaTeam* team)\n{\n    // Calculate rating modifier\
      \ based on opponent strength\n    int32 ratingChange = CalculateRatingModifier(team,\
      \ GetOpponentTeam());\n    team->FinishGame(ratingChange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally manages player statistics updates and may trigger
    database writes to persist changes. It should only be called once per match completion
    to avoid duplicate stat modifications. The mod parameter directly affects how
    rating points are distributed among team members.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during a single match can lead to incorrect
    statistic accumulation and rating calculations. Ensure that the modifier value
    accurately reflects the game outcome before invoking this method.
