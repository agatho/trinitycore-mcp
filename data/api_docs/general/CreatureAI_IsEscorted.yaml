  class: CreatureAI
  method: IsEscorted
  signature: bool CreatureAI::IsEscorted() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the creature is currently escorted by a player.
  description: The IsEscorted method determines if the creature AI is currently in
    an escorted state, meaning the creature is being guided or protected by a player.
    This functionality is commonly used in quest-related events where NPCs need to
    follow specific paths or remain near players. The method returns true when the
    creature is actively escorted and false otherwise. This check is typically performed
    during AI update cycles to control behavior based on escort status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently escorted by a player, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic escort status check
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->IsEscorted())\n{\n    // Creature is being escorted\n\
      \    creature->Say(\"I am being escorted!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional behavior based on escort status
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsEscorted())\n    {\n\
      \        // Perform escort-specific actions\n        if (!HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_ACTIVE))\n\
      \            StartEscort();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Normal AI behavior\
      \ when not escorted\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal escort state tracking within the CreatureAI
    class. The escort status is typically managed through related methods like StartEscort(),
    SetEscortState(), and HasEscortState(). It's important to note that this check
    only reflects the current escort state and doesn't modify it.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature has been properly initialized with escort data
    before calling this method, as accessing escort state on uninitialized creatures
    may lead to undefined behavior. This method should not be used as a replacement
    for proper quest state management.
