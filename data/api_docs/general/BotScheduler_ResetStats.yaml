  brief: Resets all statistical tracking data for bot scheduling operations
  description: The ResetStats method clears and initializes all internal statistics
    counters and tracking variables within the BotScheduler class. This method is
    typically invoked when transitioning between different bot management phases or
    when resetting the scheduler's operational state. It ensures that statistical
    measurements such as execution times, success rates, and resource usage are accurately
    reset to their initial values. The method does not require any parameters and
    performs no return operations, making it a simple state-reset utility for the
    scheduler component.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ResetStats();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting new bot scheduling cycles to
    ensure accurate statistical reporting. It is not thread-safe and should only be
    executed when no other threads are actively using the scheduler.
