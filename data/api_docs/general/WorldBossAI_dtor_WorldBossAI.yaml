documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WorldBossAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the WorldBossAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up resources associated with a world boss AI instance. This includes releasing
    any allocated memory, unregistering the AI from game systems, and ensuring proper
    destruction of child objects or components. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures that when a world boss creature
    is removed from the game world, all associated AI behavior data and references
    are properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
    The method is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WorldBossAI instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    WorldBossAI* bossAI = new WorldBossAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... AI logic here ...\n    delete bossAI; // Triggers ~WorldBossAI()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all
    derived AI classes properly call their base class destructors to maintain proper
    cleanup chain. The WorldBossAI destructor may also handle unregistering the boss
    from any active event systems or removing it from tracking lists.
