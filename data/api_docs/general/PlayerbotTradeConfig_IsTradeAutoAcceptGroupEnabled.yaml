  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsTradeAutoAcceptGroupEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the auto-accept trade feature is enabled for group members
    in player bot trading.
  description: This method checks if the automatic acceptance of trade requests from
    group members is enabled within the player bot's trading configuration. It evaluates
    the internal settings to determine whether the bot will automatically accept trade
    proposals made by players who are part of the same group as the bot. This functionality
    is typically used in automated player bot systems where bots need to interact
    with group members without manual intervention. The method does not perform any
    external operations or checks beyond its internal configuration state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if auto-accepting trades from group members is enabled, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if trade auto-accept for group is enabled
    code: "PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;\nbool isEnabled = tradeConfig.IsTradeAutoAcceptGroupEnabled();\n\
      if (isEnabled) {\n    // Bot will automatically accept trades from group members\n\
      \    printf(\"Auto-accept group trades is enabled\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Bot\
      \ requires manual acceptance of group trades\n    printf(\"Auto-accept group\
      \ trades is disabled\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only evaluates the configuration state and does not interact
    with game objects or perform network operations. It should be used in conjunction
    with other trade-related methods to fully manage player bot trading behavior.
