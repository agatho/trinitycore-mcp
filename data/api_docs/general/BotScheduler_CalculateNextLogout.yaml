  class: BotScheduler
  method: CalculateNextLogout
  signature: int BotScheduler::CalculateNextLogout(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the next logout time for a bot given its GUID.
  description: The CalculateNextLogout method determines when a bot should log out
    based on its unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically used within the
    TrinityCore bot system to manage bot session durations and ensure proper logout
    timing. The calculation considers various factors such as bot activity, configured
    logout intervals, and potential in-game events that might affect the logout schedule.
    It returns an integer representing the time in seconds until the next scheduled
    logout.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to calculate the
      next logout time. This value must be a valid bot GUID within the system's scope.
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds until the next scheduled
    logout for the specified bot. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid
    input, while zero typically means immediate logout is scheduled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int logoutTime = scheduler.CalculateNextLogout(12345); // Calculates logout\
      \ time for bot with GUID 12345\nif (logoutTime >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ scheduled logout logic\n    printf(\"Bot will log out in %d seconds\\n\",\
      \ logoutTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot configuration settings and may be affected
    by system time adjustments or active game events. The returned value should not
    be directly used for scheduling without considering potential delays or system
    load.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing bot; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect calculations or errors.
    This method assumes the bot is currently logged in and active.
