  class: Quest
  method: IsDaily
  signature: bool Quest::IsDaily() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest is a daily quest.
  description: The IsDaily method checks if the current quest is classified as a daily
    quest within the TrinityCore framework. This method returns true if the quest
    has the daily flag set in its quest data, indicating it can be completed multiple
    times per day. The method is commonly used in quest scripting and event handling
    to differentiate between daily and repeatable quests. It's important to note that
    this method does not check if a quest is actually available for completion, but
    rather whether it's classified as a daily quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is a daily quest, false otherwise. This indicates
    the quest can be completed multiple times per day.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsDaily()) {\n    // Handle daily quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest* quest) {\n    if (quest->IsDaily())\
      \ {\n        // Daily quest completed\n        // Perform daily-specific actions\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal quest data flags and may not reflect actual
    quest availability. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple
    boolean check. This method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable quest
    data.
  warnings: This method does not validate if the quest is actually available for completion,
    only that it's classified as daily. Be cautious when using in conjunction with
    other quest validation methods to avoid incorrect assumptions about quest availability.
