  method: GetItemTargetCountForEffect
  signature: int64 Spell::GetItemTargetCountForEffect(int effect) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of item targets for a specified spell effect.
  description: This method retrieves the number of item targets associated with a
    specific spell effect. It is commonly used in spell processing to determine how
    many items are affected by a given spell's effect, particularly when dealing with
    item-based spell effects such as enchanting or weapon damage. The method provides
    insight into the game mechanics related to spell targeting and item interaction,
    allowing developers to understand the behavior of spells that involve item targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the count of item targets for the specified effect. Returns
    -1 if the effect is invalid or not found, indicating no item targets are associated
    with the effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int64 itemCount = spell->GetItemTargetCountForEffect(0);\nif (itemCount\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Process the item targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the full scope of a spell's effect on items. It may be used in spell
    processing logic where item targets are counted for various effects.
  warnings: The method returns -1 if the effect index is invalid, which can lead to
    incorrect assumptions about item target counts if not properly handled in code.
