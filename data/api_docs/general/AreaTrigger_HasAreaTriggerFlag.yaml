  signature: bool AreaTrigger::HasAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the area trigger has the specified flag set.
  description: The HasAreaTriggerFlag method determines whether a specific flag is
    set within the area trigger's flag field. This functionality is used to evaluate
    various properties or states of an area trigger, such as whether it is active,
    persistent, or requires specific conditions to be met. The method performs a bitwise
    check against the internal flags stored in the area trigger object. It is commonly
    used in game logic to control behavior based on trigger configuration and state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified flag is set in the area trigger's flag field;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Check
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_ACTIVATE))\
      \ {\n    // Handle activation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Flag Evaluation
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_DYNAMIC)\
      \ &&\n    areaTrigger->HasAreaTriggerFlag(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_PERSISTENT))\
      \ {\n    // Process persistent dynamic area trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple bitwise AND operation with the flag value.
    It is important to ensure that the AreaTriggerFieldFlags enum values are correctly
    defined and aligned with the internal flag storage mechanism of the area trigger
    object.
