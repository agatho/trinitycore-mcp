  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::LoadFromDB(int objectiveResult, int criteriaResult)
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest objective criteria data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes and populates the internal data structures
    of the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr with quest objective criteria information retrieved
    from the database. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    quest data needs to be refreshed in memory. It processes the criteria associated
    with quest objectives, ensuring that all relevant data is available for quest
    progression tracking and validation. The method handles loading of various criteria
    types including kill counts, item collection, and other objective-based requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: objectiveResult
    description: An integer parameter representing the result code or identifier for
      quest objectives. This value is used to filter or identify specific sets of
      quest objectives during database loading.
  - name: criteriaResult
    description: An integer parameter representing the result code or identifier for
      criteria associated with quest objectives. This value helps determine which
      criteria entries should be loaded from the database based on their relationship
      to the specified objectives.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* mgr = new QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();

      mgr->LoadFromDB(1, 2); // Load quest objectives and criteria with IDs 1 and
      2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Specific Criteria Set for Quest Validation
    code: 'QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* mgr = sObjectMgr->GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();

      mgr->LoadFromDB(500, 1000); // Load criteria related to specific quest ID 500
      and criteria ID 1000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the necessary tables are populated. It performs a full reload of criteria
    data, which may impact performance during server startup or when reloading quest
    data dynamically.
  warnings: Calling this method while quests are actively being progressed may cause
    inconsistencies in quest tracking. Ensure that all active quests are paused or
    saved before invoking this method to prevent data corruption.
