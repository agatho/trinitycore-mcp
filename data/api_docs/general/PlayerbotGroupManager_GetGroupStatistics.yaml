  signature: GroupStatistics PlayerbotGroupManager::GetGroupStatistics(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about a specified player group
  description: The GetGroupStatistics method fetches comprehensive statistical data
    for a given player group identified by its unique group ID. This includes information
    such as group size, member distribution, average level, and other relevant metrics
    that help in understanding the composition and characteristics of the group. The
    method is typically used by bot controllers or game logic systems to make decisions
    based on group dynamics. It assumes that the specified group exists and is valid
    within the current game session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupStatistics object containing detailed metrics about the requested
    player group, including member count, average level, distribution of classes,
    and other relevant statistical data. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure
    if the group ID is invalid or the group does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve statistics for a specific group
    code: "GroupStatistics stats = botGroupManager->GetGroupStatistics(12345);\nif\
      \ (stats.memberCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Group has \" << stats.memberCount\
      \ << \" members with average level \" << stats.avgLevel << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database or cache lookups depending on implementation.
    It should be used judiciously in performance-critical sections of code as it might
    trigger data retrieval operations. The returned GroupStatistics object is typically
    immutable and represents a snapshot at the time of the call.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group ID may result in undefined behavior
    or return inconsistent data. Always validate that the group exists before calling
    this method to avoid potential errors or incorrect statistics.
