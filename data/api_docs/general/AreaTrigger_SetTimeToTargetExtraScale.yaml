  method: SetTimeToTargetExtraScale
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetTimeToTargetExtraScale(uint32 timeToTargetExtraScale)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extra scale factor for time to target adjustment on the area trigger.
  description: This method configures the time-to-target extra scale value for an
    AreaTrigger instance, which affects how the duration of the trigger's effect is
    scaled relative to its target. This scaling can influence the timing and behavior
    of effects such as spell casting or movement mechanics in World of Warcraft. The
    parameter controls a multiplier that modifies the base time-to-target calculation,
    allowing for dynamic adjustments to area trigger durations based on game state
    or conditions. This method is typically used during initialization or modification
    of area trigger properties within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: timeToTargetExtraScale
    description: The extra scale factor to apply to the time-to-target calculation.
      This value acts as a multiplier that modifies the base duration of the area
      trigger effect. Valid values are typically positive integers, with 1.0 representing
      no scaling. Values greater than 1.0 will extend the duration, while values less
      than 1.0 will shorten it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->SetTimeToTargetExtraScale(2000); // Sets the extra scale to 2.0x'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Scaling Based on Game State
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      uint32 scale = player->GetLevel() > 60 ? 1500 : 1000; // Higher scale for higher
      level players

      trigger->SetTimeToTargetExtraScale(scale);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the AreaTrigger object and
    should be called before the trigger becomes active. The scaling factor is applied
    during the calculation of time-to-target, which affects how long the area trigger
    remains active or how quickly its effects are processed.
  warnings: Modifying this value after an area trigger has been activated may produce
    unexpected behavior or inconsistencies in trigger timing. Ensure that all related
    systems and calculations are synchronized with the new scale factor to maintain
    game balance and consistency.
