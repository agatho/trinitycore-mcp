  signature: void BotSessionMgr::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot session manager functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BotSessionMgr is active
    and processing bot-related sessions. When enabled, the manager handles bot creation,
    management, and cleanup tasks. When disabled, all bot sessions are suspended and
    no new bot operations are performed. This method is typically used to toggle bot
    functionality during server maintenance or configuration changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Session Manager
    code: BotSessionMgr::instance()->SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Session Manager
    code: BotSessionMgr::instance()->SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the state of all active bot sessions. It's recommended
    to disable the manager before making configuration changes or during server shutdown
    to ensure proper cleanup of bot resources.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively running may cause unexpected
    behavior or resource leaks. Always ensure that any active bot sessions are properly
    terminated before disabling the manager.
