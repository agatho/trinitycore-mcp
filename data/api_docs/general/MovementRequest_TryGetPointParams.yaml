documentation:
  brief: Attempts to retrieve movement point parameters from a movement request.
  description: The TryGetPointParams method is used to extract and validate movement
    point parameters from a MovementRequest object. This method typically checks if
    the request contains valid destination coordinates or path data, returning an
    integer status code indicating success or failure. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and movement system, this method helps determine whether a creature or unit
    can proceed with a requested movement action based on available point parameters.
    The method does not modify the internal state of the MovementRequest object and
    is designed to be safe for read-only access during pathfinding operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 if successful in retrieving point parameters,
    -1 if parameters are invalid or missing, and other negative values indicating
    specific error conditions such as out-of-bounds coordinates or invalid path data.
    Positive return values may indicate additional information about the retrieved
    parameters.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MovementRequest request;\n// Assume request has been populated with movement\
      \ data\nint result = request.TryGetPointParams();\nif (result == 0) {\n    //\
      \ Movement point parameters successfully retrieved\n    // Proceed with pathfinding\
      \ or movement logic\n} else {\n    // Handle error condition\n    // Log error\
      \ or abort movement attempt\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes when
    a creature needs to validate its intended movement destination. It's important
    to note that this method does not perform actual pathfinding but rather validates
    the data structure containing movement parameters. The method should be used in
    conjunction with other MovementRequest methods to fully assess movement feasibility.
  warnings: This method may return different negative values for various error conditions,
    so callers should check for specific return codes if precise error handling is
    required. Additionally, calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly
    constructed MovementRequest object could lead to undefined behavior.
