  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: UpdateQuestProgress
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::UpdateQuestProgress(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest progress for a given player character within the dynamic
    quest system.
  description: The UpdateQuestProgress method is responsible for refreshing and synchronizing
    the current state of quests assigned to a specific player. This function ensures
    that any changes in quest objectives, rewards, or completion status are accurately
    reflected in the player's quest log. It typically gets invoked when a player interacts
    with quest-related NPCs, collects items, or completes objectives. The method operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's dynamic quest system, which allows for flexible
    and customizable quest behavior beyond standard quest mechanics. This function
    does not return any value but modifies internal quest data structures associated
    with the provided player.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest progress needs to be updated.
      Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      DynamicQuestSystem::UpdateQuestProgress(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Completion Handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ quest completion logic here\n    DynamicQuestSystem::UpdateQuestProgress(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's quest state has changed.
    Frequent calls without actual changes may impact performance. The method assumes
    that the provided Player pointer is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or a crash. Ensure that all player objects passed are fully constructed
    and registered with the world server before calling this function.
