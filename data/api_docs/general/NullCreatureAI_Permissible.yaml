  brief: Determines the permissiveness level of the null creature AI for a given creature
    type
  description: The Permissible method in NullCreatureAI is used to determine how permissive
    this AI implementation is for handling specific creature types. It returns an
    integer value that indicates whether the AI can be used for the given creature.
    In TrinityCore's AI system, this method is part of the AI selection mechanism
    where different AI classes are queried to see if they can handle a particular
    creature type. The return value typically follows a convention where positive
    values indicate strong suitability, zero means it can handle the creature but
    with no preference, and negative values indicate incompatibility or disinterest
    in handling that creature type.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature type ID. This is
      typically a constant value from the CreatureTemplate database entry that identifies
      what kind of creature this AI should handle.
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating permissiveness level: positive values mean
    strong suitability for handling the creature, zero means acceptable but no preference,
    negative values indicate the AI cannot or should not handle this creature type.
    The exact meaning of specific values depends on the AI system''s interpretation
    but generally follows standard TrinityCore AI selection conventions.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI selection
    code: "int permissibleValue = nullCreatureAI->Permissible(&creatureTypeId);\n\
      if (permissibleValue > 0)\n{\n    // This AI is suitable for handling this creature\
      \ type\n    // Proceed with AI assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking compatibility before AI assignment
    code: "int NullCreatureAI::Permissible(const int* creature)\n{\n    if (!creature)\n\
      \        return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n    \n    // For null AI, we typically return\
      \ 0 to indicate neutral compatibility\n    // This allows other AIs to take\
      \ precedence if they exist\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The NullCreatureAI is usually a fallback or default AI that does nothing.
    The Permissible method in this context often returns 0, indicating it's neutral
    - not actively incompatible but also not preferred. This allows other more specific
    AI implementations to take over when available. The method signature uses a pointer
    to int for the creature parameter which aligns with how creature type IDs are
    typically stored and referenced in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting negative return values from Permissible
    as they may indicate that this AI should not be used for a particular creature
    type, but the exact meaning depends on the broader AI selection system. Also note
    that passing null pointers to the creature parameter could lead to undefined behavior
    if not properly checked.
