documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GroupMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GroupMgr
    class, providing global access to the group management system. This method ensures
    that only one instance of GroupMgr exists throughout the application lifecycle.
    The returned pointer can be used to access all group-related functionality including
    player grouping, raid management, and group synchronization operations. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this is essential for managing player parties
    and raids across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single GroupMgr instance. The method never returns NULL
    as it's implemented as a singleton with guaranteed instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Group Manager for Group Operations
    code: "GroupMgr* groupManager = GroupMgr::instance();\nPlayerGroup* group = groupManager->GetGroupById(12345);\n\
      if (group)\n{\n    group->AddMember(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Group Manager in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    GroupMgr* mgr = GroupMgr::instance();\n\
      \    if (mgr->IsGroupActive(player->GetGroup()))\n    {\n        // Handle group-related\
      \ logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is created during application
    initialization. The GroupMgr singleton manages all active groups in the server,
    making it a central point for group-related operations throughout the TrinityCore
    codebase.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton pattern, avoid creating multiple instances or
    storing references to the GroupMgr instance beyond its intended scope. The returned
    pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage its lifetime.
