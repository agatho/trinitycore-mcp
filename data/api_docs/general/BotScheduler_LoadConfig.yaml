documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads configuration settings for the bot scheduler system
  description: The LoadConfig method initializes the bot scheduler by loading all
    relevant configuration parameters from the database or configuration files. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when the scheduler needs to
    refresh its settings. It reads various scheduling parameters such as bot spawn
    rates, behavior thresholds, and time-based scheduling rules that govern how bots
    are managed within the World of Warcraft environment. The method ensures that
    all internal scheduler configurations are properly set before the bot management
    system begins operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the bot scheduler. Repeated calls may cause configuration conflicts or duplicate
    settings loading. The method internally handles database connections and configuration
    parsing, so no explicit connection management is required from calling code.
  warnings: Calling LoadConfig multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to memory
    leaks or inconsistent scheduling behavior. Ensure that this method is called before
    any bot scheduling operations begin to avoid runtime errors.
