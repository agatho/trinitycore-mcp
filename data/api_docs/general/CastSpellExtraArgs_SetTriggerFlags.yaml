  signature: CastSpellExtraArgs & CastSpellExtraArgs::SetTriggerFlags(TriggerCastFlags
    flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the trigger flags for a spell cast operation, determining how the spell
    is triggered and executed.
  description: The SetTriggerFlags method configures the trigger behavior of a spell
    cast by assigning specific TriggerCastFlags to the CastSpellExtraArgs object.
    This allows developers to control aspects such as whether the spell is cast as
    a triggered spell, if it should bypass normal spell restrictions, or if it should
    be treated as a channeled spell. The method returns a reference to the same CastSpellExtraArgs
    object, enabling method chaining for fluent API usage. This functionality is essential
    when implementing custom spell behaviors, aura effects, or special spell triggers
    within TrinityCore's spell system.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The TriggerCastFlags value to set for the spell cast operation. Valid
      values include flags such as TRIGGERED_CAST_NORMAL, TRIGGERED_CAST_AURA_UPDATE,
      TRIGGERED_CAST_SPELL_DAMAGE, etc., which define how the spell should be processed
      during execution.
  returns: A reference to the CastSpellExtraArgs object, allowing for method chaining
    to configure multiple spell cast properties in sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SetTriggerFlags
    code: 'CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetTriggerFlags(TRIGGERED_CAST_NORMAL);

      // This configures the spell to be cast normally, without special triggering
      behavior.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Multiple Trigger Flags
    code: "CastSpellExtraArgs args;\nargs.SetTriggerFlags(TRIGGERED_CAST_NORMAL)\n\
      \    .SetTriggerFlags(TRIGGERED_CAST_AURA_UPDATE);\n// This sets multiple trigger\
      \ behaviors for a single spell cast operation."
    language: cpp
  notes: The TriggerCastFlags enum values are defined in the TrinityCore spell system
    and should be used according to their intended purpose. Incorrect flag combinations
    may lead to unexpected behavior or spell execution errors. This method is typically
    used when creating custom spells, aura effects, or when triggering spells programmatically
    from game logic.
  warnings: Using invalid or incompatible TriggerCastFlags can cause runtime errors
    or undefined behavior. Always verify that the flags being set are appropriate
    for the specific spell and context in which they're used. Be cautious when chaining
    multiple trigger flags as some combinations may conflict with each other.
