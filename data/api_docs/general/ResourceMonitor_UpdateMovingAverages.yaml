  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: UpdateMovingAverages
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::UpdateMovingAverages()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the moving averages for resource usage statistics.
  description: The UpdateMovingAverages method calculates and updates the moving average
    values for various resource metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and
    network activity. This method is typically called periodically by the ResourceMonitor
    class to maintain up-to-date performance statistics. It aggregates recent data
    points and applies a smoothing algorithm to provide more stable and representative
    metrics over time. The updated averages are used for monitoring server health,
    detecting performance degradation, and triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

  - title: Basic Usage in Resource Monitoring Loop
    code: "void ResourceMonitor::UpdateMovingAverages()\n{\n    // Update internal\
      \ moving averages\n    _cpuAverage = _cpuSamples.CalculateMovingAverage();\n\
      \    _memoryAverage = _memorySamples.CalculateMovingAverage();\n    _networkAverage\
      \ = _networkSamples.CalculateMovingAverage();\n}\n\n// Called periodically in\
      \ main loop\nresourceMonitor.UpdateMovingAverages();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called at regular intervals to maintain accurate resource
    statistics. The moving average calculation typically uses a sliding window approach
    with configurable sample sizes. Performance impact is minimal as it only processes
    recent samples rather than all historical data.
