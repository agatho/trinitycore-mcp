  class: WaypointMgr
  method: ReloadPath
  signature: void WaypointMgr::ReloadPath(uint32 pathId)
documentation:
  brief: Reloads a specific waypoint path from the database, updating all active creatures
    following that path.
  description: The ReloadPath method refreshes the waypoint data for a specified path
    ID by reloading it from the database. This is typically used during runtime when
    waypoint data has been modified and needs to be applied without restarting the
    server. The method updates all creatures currently following the specified path
    with the new waypoint information, ensuring that their movement behavior reflects
    the latest changes in the database. It's commonly invoked through in-game commands
    or admin tools to dynamically adjust NPC movement patterns without downtime.
  parameters:
  - name: pathId
    description: The unique identifier of the waypoint path to reload. This corresponds
      to the PathId field in the creature_waypoint table and must reference a valid
      existing path in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reload a specific waypoint path
    code: WaypointMgr::instance()->ReloadPath(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Reload path based on command input
    code: "if (args.length() > 0)\n{\n    uint32 pathId = atoi(args.c_str());\n  \
      \  WaypointMgr::instance()->ReloadPath(pathId);\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Waypoint path %u reloaded.\", pathId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the singleton instance of WaypointMgr and is thread-safe
    for concurrent access. It will not affect creatures that are not currently following
    the specified path, but will update all active waypoints in memory with the latest
    data from the database.
  warnings: Calling this method while creatures are actively moving along the path
    may cause temporary movement glitches or unexpected behavior until the reload
    is complete. Ensure that path modifications are made carefully to avoid disrupting
    ongoing gameplay.
