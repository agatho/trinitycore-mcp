  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: HealBattlePetsPct
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::HealBattlePetsPct(int pct)
documentation:
  brief: Heals all battle pets in the manager by a specified percentage.
  description: The HealBattlePetsPct method restores a percentage of maximum health
    to all active battle pets managed by the BattlePetMgr instance. This method is
    typically used during combat or in specific game events where pet health needs
    to be partially restored without fully healing them. The healing amount is calculated
    as a percentage of each pet's maximum health, ensuring that pets regain a proportional
    amount of their total health pool. This functionality supports game mechanics
    related to pet management and battle strategies in World of Warcraft's Battle
    Pet system.
  parameters:
  - name: pct
    description: The percentage of maximum health to restore to each battle pet. Valid
      values range from 0 to 100, where 0 means no healing occurs and 100 means full
      healing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Heal all battle pets by 50%
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->HealBattlePetsPct(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Restore full health to all battle pets
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->HealBattlePetsPct(100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on all currently active battle pets within the manager.
    It does not affect inactive or non-existent pets. The percentage value is clamped
    to valid ranges (0-100) internally, but developers should ensure proper input
    validation if used in custom systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with a high percentage value may cause unexpected
    behavior if pets are already at full health, as it could potentially trigger redundant
    healing calculations. Ensure that the percentage parameter is validated before
    calling to prevent unintended effects.
