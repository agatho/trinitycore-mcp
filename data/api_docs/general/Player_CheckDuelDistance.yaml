documentation:
  brief: Checks duel distance and updates duel status accordingly
  description: This method checks the current distance between players during a duel
    and updates the duel status based on the distance criteria. It is typically called
    during duel events to ensure that players maintain proper distance for the duel
    to continue. The method evaluates whether players are within the required distance
    range to keep the duel active or terminates the duel if they move too far apart.
    This function plays a crucial role in maintaining game balance and preventing
    exploits during duels.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player1 = new Player();

      Player* player2 = new Player();


      // This method would typically be called internally during duel processing

      // CheckDuelDistance(time_t currTime);

      // The method updates duel status based on distance between players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal duel handling system and should not be
    called directly by external code. It relies on time-based calculations to determine
    whether players are within acceptable distance for duels to continue.
  warnings: This method should not be used outside of duel context as it may cause
    unexpected behavior or crash if called without proper duel state initialization.
