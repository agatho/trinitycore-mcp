  signature: void PlayerSkillProfile::CalculateFrustration()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the player's frustration level based on skill progress
    and performance.
  description: The CalculateFrustration method determines the current frustration
    state of a player by evaluating their recent skill acquisition attempts, success
    rates, and performance metrics within the game. This method is typically invoked
    during skill training sessions or when a player's progress stagnates. It modifies
    internal player statistics related to motivation and engagement, which can influence
    future skill learning efficiency and gameplay experience. The calculation considers
    factors such as time spent practicing, number of failed attempts, and overall
    progression speed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Skill Training Context
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      profile->CalculateFrustration();

      // Updates the player''s frustration level based on current skill progress'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state tracking systems
    and may affect subsequent skill learning modifiers. It should be called periodically
    during extended training sessions to maintain accurate frustration metrics.
  warnings: Invoking this method without proper context or player skill data may lead
    to incorrect frustration calculations. Ensure that relevant skill data is initialized
    before calling this method.
