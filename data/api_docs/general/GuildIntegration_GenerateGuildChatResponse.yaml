  method: GenerateGuildChatResponse
  signature: std::string GuildIntegration::GenerateGuildChatResponse(int * player,
    const GuildChatMessage & message)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a formatted chat response for guild messages based on player context
    and message content.
  description: The GenerateGuildChatResponse method processes incoming guild chat
    messages and constructs an appropriate response string that includes contextual
    information about the player and the message. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to handle guild communication logic, ensuring proper
    formatting and handling of guild-specific chat interactions. The method takes
    a pointer to a player object and a guild chat message structure as inputs, and
    returns a formatted string suitable for display in the game's chat interface.
    It may perform validation on the input parameters and apply guild-specific rules
    or filters before generating the response.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or context
      within the guild system. This parameter is used to determine the sender's permissions,
      rank, or other guild-related properties that may affect the chat response.
  - name: message
    description: A constant reference to a GuildChatMessage structure containing the
      details of the guild chat message being processed, including content, timestamp,
      and other relevant metadata.
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted guild chat response. The returned
    string typically includes properly formatted text that can be directly displayed
    in the game's chat window, potentially incorporating player-specific information
    or guild rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildChatMessage msg;

      msg.content = "Hello everyone!";

      msg.timestamp = time(nullptr);

      std::string response = guildIntegration.GenerateGuildChatResponse(&playerId,
      msg);

      // response now contains the formatted chat message'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int* playerPtr = nullptr;\nGuildChatMessage msg;\nmsg.content = \"Test\
      \ message\";\nstd::string result = guildIntegration.GenerateGuildChatResponse(playerPtr,\
      \ msg);\nif (!result.empty()) {\n    // Process the generated response\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Generated response: \" << result << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle invalid input case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to generate chat\
      \ response\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GuildIntegration class which handles all aspects
    of guild communication in TrinityCore. The implementation likely includes checks
    for player permissions, guild rank validation, and message filtering based on
    guild settings. It may also integrate with existing chat logging systems or moderation
    tools.
  warnings: The player parameter must not be null; passing a null pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes within the method. Additionally, ensure that
    the GuildChatMessage structure is properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected results.
