  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetType
  signature: MovementRequestType MovementRequest::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the movement request.
  description: The GetType method returns the MovementRequestType enumeration value
    that represents the specific type of movement request this object encapsulates.
    This is used internally by the TrinityCore movement system to determine how to
    process different kinds of movement commands, such as walk, run, fly, or teleport
    requests. The returned value indicates the semantic meaning and expected behavior
    of the movement request within the game's physics and AI systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MovementRequestType enumeration value indicating the specific type of
    movement request. Possible values may include constants like MOVEMENT_REQUEST_WALK,
    MOVEMENT_REQUEST_RUN, MOVEMENT_REQUEST_FLY, or MOVEMENT_REQUEST_TELEPORT depending
    on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nMovementRequestType type = request.GetType();\n\
      if (type == MOVEMENT_REQUEST_WALK)\n{\n    // Handle walking movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not modify the internal state of
    the MovementRequest object. It should be called frequently during movement processing
    to determine appropriate handling logic for different movement types.
