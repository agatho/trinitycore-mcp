documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot requires facing direction for class-specific actions.
  description: The RequiresFacingForClass method checks if a given bot player requires
    a specific facing direction to perform class-based actions. This is typically
    used in AI behavior logic to ensure that bots properly orient themselves before
    executing certain abilities or interactions. The method evaluates the bot's current
    class and returns true if facing direction is required for that class, otherwise
    false. This functionality supports proper positioning and targeting mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's class requires facing direction for actions,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (TargetAssistAction::RequiresFacingForClass(bot)) {\n    // Ensure bot\
      \ is properly facing target before action\n    bot->SetFacingTo(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class definitions and AI configuration
    data within TrinityCore. It may be used in conjunction with other targeting or
    movement logic to ensure proper bot behavior during combat or interaction scenarios.
