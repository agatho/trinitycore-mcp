documentation:
  brief: Adds combo points to the player's combo point tracker
  description: The AddComboPoints method increases the number of combo points currently
    available for the player. In World of Warcraft's combat system, combo points are
    used by certain abilities and attacks (such as those from Rogues or Druids in
    Cat Form) to enhance their damage or effects. This method directly modifies the
    internal combo point counter without any validation checks on the input value.
    The maximum number of combo points a player can have is typically 5, though this
    may vary depending on class and special abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The number of combo points to add to the current total. Must be a
      non-negative integer. Values exceeding the maximum allowed combo points (usually
      5) will result in the counter being capped at that value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage
    code: 'ComboPointSystem* cps = player->GetComboPointSystem();

      cps->AddComboPoints(1); // Adds one combo point to the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple combo points
    code: 'ComboPointSystem* cps = player->GetComboPointSystem();

      cps->AddComboPoints(3); // Adds three combo points, up to a maximum of 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any checks for whether the player has the required
    class or specialization that supports combo points. It is assumed that the calling
    code ensures this condition. The internal combo point counter is typically managed
    by the game engine and should not be modified directly outside of combat mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may lead to undefined behavior
    if the system does not validate inputs. It's recommended to only pass positive
    integers or zero to ensure correct functionality.
