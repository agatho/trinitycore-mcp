  class: DestructionImmolateTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 DestructionImmolateTracker::GetTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds for an immolate effect on a
    target with the specified GUID.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method is used to determine how much time is left
    before an Immolate spell effect expires on a specific target. This method is typically
    part of the DestructionImmolateTracker class which manages tracking of immolate
    effects applied by destruction warlocks. The method takes a GUID parameter that
    identifies the target whose immolate timer is being queried. It returns the time
    remaining in milliseconds, or zero if no immolate effect is active on the specified
    target. This functionality is crucial for managing spell durations and ensuring
    proper behavior during combat mechanics such as stacking effects, damage calculations,
    and cooldown management.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target whose immolate effect
      time remaining is being queried. This should be a valid object GUID corresponding
      to a creature or player in the game world.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time remaining in milliseconds
    for the immolate effect on the specified target. Returns 0 if no immolate effect
    is active on the target or if the target does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check immolate duration
    code: "uint32 remainingTime = tracker->GetTimeRemaining(playerGuid);\nif (remainingTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Immolate is still active, display time remaining\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Immolate has %u ms remaining.\", remainingTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using time remaining to determine effect status
    code: "uint32 timeLeft = tracker->GetTimeRemaining(targetGuid);\nif (timeLeft\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Immolate has expired, can now apply new effect\n    DoImmolateEffect(target);\n\
      }\nelse if (timeLeft < 5000)\n{\n    // Less than 5 seconds remaining, consider\
      \ refreshing\n    RefreshImmolate(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DestructionImmolateTracker has been properly
    initialized and maintains a mapping of active immolate effects. The GUID parameter
    should correspond to an existing object in the world; otherwise, the method will
    return 0. Performance is generally O(1) assuming proper data structure implementation
    (e.g., hash map or similar).
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid target
    in the current game context. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to
    unexpected behavior or incorrect time calculations.
