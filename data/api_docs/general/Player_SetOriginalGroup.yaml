  class: Player
  method: SetOriginalGroup
  signature: void Player::SetOriginalGroup(Group * group, int8 subgroup)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the original group for a player, establishing their initial group membership.
  description: This method assigns a player to an original group, which is typically
    used during character creation or when a player joins a group for the first time.
    The method sets the group's subgroup assignment for the player, allowing the system
    to track group membership and maintain proper group coordination. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other group-related methods to ensure that players are
    properly associated with their original group structure.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that the player will be assigned to as
      their original group. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: subgroup
    description: The subgroup index that the player will be assigned to within the
      group. This value should be between -1 and 8, where -1 indicates no subgroup
      assignment, and values 0-7 represent valid subgroups.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a player to an original group
    code: 'Group* group = new Group();

      Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetOriginalGroup(group, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during character creation or when a player
    joins a group for the first time. It should be called before any group-related
    operations are performed. The method does not directly modify the group's internal
    structure but rather sets the player's original group assignment.
  warnings: This method should not be called with null group pointers, as it will
    cause undefined behavior. Also, care must be taken when assigning subgroups to
    ensure that the values are within valid range (0-7) or -1 for no subgroup.
