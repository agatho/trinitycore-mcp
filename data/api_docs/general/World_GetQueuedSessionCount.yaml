  method: GetQueuedSessionCount
  signature: uint32 World::GetQueuedSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of sessions currently queued for connection to the world
    server.
  description: The GetQueuedSessionCount method retrieves the count of client sessions
    that are waiting in the queue to establish a connection to the World of Warcraft
    server. This value represents the number of players who have initiated the login
    process but have not yet completed authentication and session establishment. The
    queued sessions are typically managed by the login server or authentication system
    before being transferred to the world server. This method is useful for monitoring
    server load, tracking player influx, and managing connection capacity during peak
    hours.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of queued sessions waiting
    to connect to the world server. Returns zero if no sessions are currently queued.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor queued connections
    code: "uint32 queuedCount = sWorld->GetQueuedSessionCount();\nif (queuedCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High number of queued sessions:\
      \ %u\", queuedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement connection throttling logic
    code: "void CheckConnectionCapacity()\n{\n    uint32 queued = sWorld->GetQueuedSessionCount();\n\
      \    if (queued > MAX_QUEUED_SESSIONS)\n    {\n        // Implement temporary\
      \ login restrictions\n        sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"Too many queued\
      \ sessions: %u\", queued);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current queue state and is typically
    called from server monitoring systems or connection management code. The value
    returned reflects only the count of sessions that are in the authentication/queue
    phase, not active player sessions. This method is thread-safe and can be safely
    called from multiple threads.
  warnings: The queued session count may fluctuate rapidly during high-traffic periods.
    Applications relying on this value should account for potential race conditions
    or rapid changes in the queue size. The return value does not include already
    authenticated players, only those in the connection queue.
