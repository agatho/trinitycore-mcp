documentation:
  brief: Updates the defensive behavior manager's internal state based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    defensive behaviors of units within the game world. It typically handles AI logic
    related to defensive actions such as threat management, target selection, and
    behavior adjustments based on time-based events. This method is called regularly
    by the game loop to ensure that defensive behaviors remain current and responsive
    to changing conditions in the game world.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'DefensiveBehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      manager->Update(100); // Update with 100ms elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or AI update system.
    It should be called frequently to maintain accurate defensive behavior states,
    and performance considerations should be taken into account when implementing
    complex defensive logic.
