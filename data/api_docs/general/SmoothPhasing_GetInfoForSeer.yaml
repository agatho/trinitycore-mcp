  class: SmoothPhasing

  signature: const SmoothPhasingInfo * SmoothPhasing::GetInfoForSeer(ObjectGuid seer)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the smooth phasing information for a specific seer object.
  description: The GetInfoForSeer method retrieves the SmoothPhasingInfo structure
    associated with a given ObjectGuid representing a seer. This method is used in
    TrinityCore's phasing system to determine what phasing data should be applied
    to a particular observer (seer) in the world. The returned pointer provides access
    to phasing details such as phase masks, phasemask flags, and other relevant information
    that governs how objects are visible or hidden based on player phasing rules.
    This functionality is crucial for implementing dynamic visibility changes in World
    of Warcraft's phased environments.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The ObjectGuid identifying the observer (typically a player) for
      whom to retrieve phasing information.
  returns: A const pointer to SmoothPhasingInfo structure containing phasing data
    for the specified seer, or nullptr if no phasing information is found for the
    given seer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ObjectGuid seerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nconst SmoothPhasingInfo* info\
      \ = smoothPhasing->GetInfoForSeer(seerGuid);\nif (info)\n{\n    // Use the phasing\
      \ information\n    uint32 phaseMask = info->GetPhaseMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Phasing Data
    code: "ObjectGuid seerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nconst SmoothPhasingInfo* info\
      \ = smoothPhasing->GetInfoForSeer(seerGuid);\nif (info && info->IsEnabled())\n\
      {\n    // Process phasing logic only if enabled\n    uint32 phaseMask = info->GetPhaseMask();\n\
      \    // Apply visibility changes based on phaseMask\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that maps ObjectGuids
    to SmoothPhasingInfo objects. The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime
    of the SmoothPhasing object and should not be stored for later use. The phasing
    system relies on proper initialization of phasing data before this method can
    return meaningful results.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned SmoothPhasingInfo structure through the returned
    pointer as it may lead to undefined behavior. Always check if the returned pointer
    is valid (not null) before accessing its members. This method should only be called
    from contexts where the seer's phasing data has been properly initialized.
