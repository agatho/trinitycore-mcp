  signature: void SpatialQueryOptimizer::OnFrameStart()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes spatial query optimization data structures at the start of each
    game frame.
  description: The OnFrameStart method prepares the SpatialQueryOptimizer for processing
    spatial queries during the current game frame. It resets internal tracking states,
    initializes query counters, and ensures that all spatial data structures are in
    a consistent state for efficient query execution. This method is typically called
    once per game frame by the core engine to maintain optimal performance of spatial
    operations such as object visibility checks, collision detection, and area-of-effect
    spell calculations. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no
    direct return operations.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in game frame processing
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sSpatialQueryOptimizer->OnFrameStart();\n\
      \    // ... continue with spatial queries ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked at the beginning of each game frame before
    any spatial queries are performed. It is designed to be thread-safe and does not
    require external synchronization. The internal state reset ensures that query
    performance remains consistent across frames.
