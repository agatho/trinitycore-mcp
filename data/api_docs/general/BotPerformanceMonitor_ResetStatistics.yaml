  method: ResetStatistics
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all performance statistics tracked by the bot performance monitor.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all accumulated performance data
    within the BotPerformanceMonitor instance. This includes resetting counters, timers,
    and any other metrics that have been collected since the monitor was initialized
    or last reset. The method is typically used to start a fresh measurement period
    or to clear outdated statistics before beginning new monitoring sessions. It does
    not affect the monitor's operational state or configuration; it only clears the
    recorded data. This function is essential for maintaining accurate performance
    tracking over time, especially in long-running systems where cumulative data could
    skew results if not periodically cleared.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      // ... some monitoring activity ...

      monitor.ResetStatistics(); // Clear all collected stats'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before New Monitoring Session
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      // Monitor performance for a session

      // ... perform monitoring tasks ...

      monitor.ResetStatistics(); // Reset before next session

      class BotAI* ai = new BotAI();

      ai->StartMonitoring(); // Begin fresh monitoring'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without causing
    race conditions. It's recommended to call this method before starting a new performance
    measurement cycle to ensure accurate results.
