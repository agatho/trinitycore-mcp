  method: TransportScript
  signature: void TransportScript::TransportScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new transport script with the specified name.
  description: The TransportScript constructor initializes a new transport script
    instance with the provided name. This method is used to register and set up transport-related
    scripts within the TrinityCore framework, allowing custom behavior to be defined
    for game objects that function as transports such as boats, elevators, or other
    moving platforms. The name parameter uniquely identifies this script instance
    and is typically used for logging, debugging, and internal lookup purposes. This
    constructor is part of the scripting system that enables developers to extend
    transport functionality beyond default behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that serves as the unique identifier for
      this transport script instance. This name is used internally by the TrinityCore
      framework for script registration and lookup purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Transport Script Initialization
    code: "class MyTransportScript : public TransportScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyTransportScript()\
      \ : TransportScript(\"MyCustomTransport\")\n    {\n        // Custom initialization\
      \ code here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Transport Script with Custom Logic
    code: "class BoatTransportScript : public TransportScript\n{\npublic:\n    BoatTransportScript()\
      \ : TransportScript(\"BoatTransport\")\n    {\n        // Register custom callbacks\
      \ or set up transport-specific behavior\n    }\n\n    void OnTransportUpdate(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        // Custom update logic for the boat transport\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should be called during object initialization and is typically
    not invoked directly by user code. The name parameter must be a valid null-terminated
    string, and duplicate names may cause conflicts in script registration. This method
    does not perform any validation on the input name, so developers should ensure
    uniqueness and validity of names.
  warnings: Incorrectly naming transport scripts can lead to conflicts or unexpected
    behavior during script loading. Avoid using special characters or spaces in the
    name parameter as they might cause issues with internal lookup mechanisms. Do
    not call this constructor multiple times for the same instance as it may result
    in undefined behavior.
