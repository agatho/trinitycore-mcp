documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current marksmanship spell cast by the player
  description: The InterruptCast method terminates any ongoing marksmanship spell
    casting process for the associated player. This method is typically invoked when
    external factors, such as damage or movement, cause the player's casting to be
    disrupted. It ensures that the casting state is properly reset and any visual
    effects or animations related to the cast are cancelled. The method does not perform
    any validation checks on whether a cast is actually in progress, and it assumes
    the caller has verified the appropriate conditions before invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Usage
    code: "void OnPlayerDamage(Unit* attacker) {\n    if (m_player->IsCasting()) {\n\
      \        m_castManager->InterruptCast();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt Cast on Movement
    code: "void OnPlayerMove() {\n    if (m_player->IsCasting() && m_player->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_MOVING))\
      \ {\n        m_castManager->InterruptCast();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is confirmed to be in a
    casting state. It does not handle cleanup of resources or restoration of previous
    states beyond interrupting the cast itself.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a cast is actually active may
    lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent state. Ensure proper checks are in
    place before invoking InterruptCast.
