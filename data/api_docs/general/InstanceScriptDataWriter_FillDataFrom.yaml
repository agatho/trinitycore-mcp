  method: FillDataFrom
  signature: void InstanceScriptDataWriter::FillDataFrom(const std::string & data)
documentation:
  brief: Parses and processes instance script data from a string input to populate
    internal state.
  description: The FillDataFrom method is used to deserialize and load instance script
    data from a string representation into the InstanceScriptDataWriter's internal
    storage. This method typically handles parsing of saved game state information,
    such as boss kill statuses, event progress, or other instance-specific variables
    that need to be restored when an instance is loaded. The method processes the
    input string according to the expected format for instance script data and updates
    the writer's internal data structures accordingly. It is commonly used during
    instance loading or restoration phases in TrinityCore's instance management system.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A constant reference to a std::string containing the serialized instance
      script data to be parsed and processed. This string typically contains key-value
      pairs or structured data representing the current state of an instance's scripted
      elements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for loading instance data
    code: 'InstanceScriptDataWriter writer;

      std::string savedData = "boss1_killed=1;event_progress=50;"

      writer.FillDataFrom(savedData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading data during instance creation
    code: "void OnInstanceLoad() {\n    InstanceScriptDataWriter writer;\n    if (instance->GetBossSaveData())\
      \ {\n        writer.FillDataFrom(instance->GetBossSaveData());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input string is properly formatted and contains
    valid instance script data. It may throw exceptions or produce undefined behavior
    if the data format is incorrect or corrupted. The method should only be called
    after the InstanceScriptDataWriter has been properly initialized with a valid
    instance context.
  warnings: Do not call this method with malformed or untrusted input data, as it
    could lead to parsing errors or memory corruption. Ensure that the data string
    contains only expected keys and values relevant to the instance's script system.
