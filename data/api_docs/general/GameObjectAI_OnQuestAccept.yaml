documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player accepts a quest from a game object.
  description: The OnQuestAccept method is invoked when a player interacts with a
    game object and accepts a quest offered by it. This method allows custom AI behavior
    to be defined for game objects that provide quests, such as triggering specific
    actions, modifying quest states, or interacting with the player's quest log. The
    method is part of the GameObjectAI class and is typically overridden in custom
    game object AI implementations. It provides access to both the player who accepted
    the quest and the quest being accepted, enabling developers to implement complex
    quest-related logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who accepted the quest.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was accepted by the player.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnQuestAccept(Player*\
      \ player, const Quest* quest) override\n    {\n        // Log the quest acceptance\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player %s accepted quest %u\", player->GetName(),\
      \ quest->GetQuestId());\n        \n        // Perform custom logic here\n  \
      \      // For example, spawn an NPC or change object state\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Accept Logic
    code: "class QuestGiverAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnQuestAccept(Player*\
      \ player, const Quest* quest) override\n    {\n        // Check if the quest\
      \ is a specific one\n        if (quest->GetQuestId() == 12345)\n        {\n\
      \            // Give player a reward item\n            player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n            \n            // Send custom message to player\n        \
      \    player->SendNotification(\"You have accepted the quest and received your\
      \ reward!\");\n            \n            // Trigger an event or change game\
      \ state\n            DoEventTrigger(EVENT_QUEST_ACCEPTED);\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"

  notes: This method is called during the quest acceptance process, after the player
    has confirmed they want to accept the quest but before any quest-related rewards
    or state changes are applied. It's important to note that this method should not
    be used for modifying quest data directly; instead, use appropriate quest APIs
    provided by the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it may block the game
    loop. Also, ensure that any modifications to player or quest state are done through
    proper API functions to maintain game integrity and prevent exploits.
