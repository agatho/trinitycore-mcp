  signature: uint32 DestructibleHitpoint::GetMaxHealth() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum health value of a destructible hitpoint object.
  description: The GetMaxHealth method returns the maximum health points (HP) that
    a destructible hitpoint object can have. This value typically represents the full
    health state of an object such as a wall, door, or other interactive environment
    element in the game world. The returned value is used to determine how much damage
    can be inflicted before the object is destroyed. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is purely informational, making it safe to call multiple times
    without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum health points of the destructible
    hitpoint object. This value indicates the total HP capacity before the object
    becomes destroyed or inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DestructibleHitpoint* hitpoint = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint32 maxHealth = hitpoint->GetMaxHealth();

      printf("Maximum health: %u\n", maxHealth);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Damage Calculation Example
    code: 'DestructibleHitpoint* hitpoint = ...;

      uint32 maxHealth = hitpoint->GetMaxHealth();

      uint32 currentHealth = hitpoint->GetCurrentHealth();

      float damagePercentage = (float)(maxHealth - currentHealth) / maxHealth * 100.0f;

      printf("Damage taken: %.2f%%\n", damagePercentage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other hitpoint-related
    methods to manage the state of destructible objects. The value returned by GetMaxHealth
    should remain constant for the lifetime of the object unless explicitly modified
    through other API calls.
