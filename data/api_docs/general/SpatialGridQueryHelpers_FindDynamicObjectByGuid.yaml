  method: FindDynamicObjectByGuid
  signature: const DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::DynamicObjectSnapshot * SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDynamicObjectByGuid(Player
    * bot, int guid, float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds a dynamic object by its GUID within a specified search radius for a
    player.
  description: The FindDynamicObjectByGuid method searches for a specific dynamic
    object in the spatial grid around a given player, using the object's unique identifier
    (GUID) and a defined search radius. It returns a snapshot of the dynamic object
    if found within the specified range, otherwise it returns nullptr. This functionality
    is essential for AI-driven bots or systems that need to interact with environmental
    objects such as traps, area effects, or temporary game entities in World of Warcraft.
    The method leverages the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid system for efficient spatial
    queries and ensures thread-safe access to dynamic object data.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI bot or player character
      performing the search.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the dynamic
      object being searched for.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance in yards from the player's
      position to search for the dynamic object.
  returns: A pointer to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::DynamicObjectSnapshot structure
    if a matching dynamic object is found within the specified radius; otherwise,
    returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint trapGuid = 12345;\nfloat radius = 10.0f;\nconst\
      \ DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::DynamicObjectSnapshot* trap = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDynamicObjectByGuid(bot,\
      \ trapGuid, radius);\nif (trap != nullptr) {\n    // Process the found trap\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint guid = 98765;\nfloat searchRadius = 25.0f;\nconst\
      \ DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::DynamicObjectSnapshot* obj = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDynamicObjectByGuid(bot,\
      \ guid, searchRadius);\nif (obj == nullptr) {\n    // No object found within\
      \ radius\n    sLog->outString(\"No dynamic object with GUID %d found within\
      \ %.2f yards.\", guid, searchRadius);\n} else {\n    // Object found, use its\
      \ properties\n    Position pos = obj->GetPosition();\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found dynamic object at (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\", pos.GetX(), pos.GetY(), pos.GetZ());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a double-buffered spatial grid, which means it accesses
    the most recent snapshot of dynamic objects at the time of query. The search is
    performed using the player's current position and the specified radius. Ensure
    that the GUID corresponds to an actual dynamic object in the game world; otherwise,
    the function will return nullptr.
  warnings: Do not assume that a returned pointer is valid beyond the scope of the
    current update cycle, as the spatial grid may be updated asynchronously. Also,
    be cautious with very large search radii as they can impact performance due to
    increased spatial query overhead.
