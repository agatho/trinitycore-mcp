  class: WarriorAI
  method: OptimizeAbilityPriorities
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeAbilityPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the priority order of warrior abilities based on current combat
    state and cooldowns.
  description: The OptimizeAbilityPriorities method dynamically adjusts the sequence
    in which a warrior AI character executes its available abilities. This optimization
    takes into account factors such as ability cooldowns, resource requirements (like
    rage or energy), and the current combat situation to ensure that the most effective
    abilities are prioritized at any given moment. The method is typically called
    during the AI's update cycle to maintain an optimal ability usage strategy throughout
    a fight. It modifies internal state variables related to ability selection and
    timing without directly affecting the character's behavior outside of combat decision-making.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    OptimizeAbilityPriorities();\n    // ... rest of AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat decision-making system for warrior
    AIs in TrinityCore. It should be invoked regularly during the AI update loop to
    maintain up-to-date ability priorities. The optimization process considers both
    static ability properties and dynamic combat conditions such as target health,
    player buffs/debuffs, and available resources.
