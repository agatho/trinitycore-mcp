  method: GetDeathRecoveryManager
  signature: const DeathRecoveryManager * BotAI::GetDeathRecoveryManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the DeathRecoveryManager instance associated with this
    BotAI.
  description: The GetDeathRecoveryManager method provides access to the DeathRecoveryManager
    object that handles death-related recovery mechanics for the bot. This manager
    is responsible for managing the bot's behavior upon death, including resurrection
    logic, loot recovery, and other post-death actions. The returned pointer is constant,
    indicating that the caller should not modify the manager through this interface.
    The method is typically used by internal AI systems to query or interact with
    the death recovery functionality without directly manipulating the manager's state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the DeathRecoveryManager instance associated with this
    BotAI. Returns nullptr if no death recovery manager has been initialized for this
    bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const DeathRecoveryManager* drm = botAI->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\nif\
      \ (drm != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the death recovery manager\n    drm->HandleDeath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Manager
    code: "const DeathRecoveryManager* drm = botAI->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\nif\
      \ (drm == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle case where death recovery manager is not\
      \ initialized\n    sLog->outError(\"BotAI has no death recovery manager initialized\"\
      );\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with using the manager\n    drm->ResetRecoveryState();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DeathRecoveryManager instance returned by this method is owned and managed
    by the BotAI class. The caller should not attempt to delete or modify the returned
    pointer directly. This method is thread-safe as long as the underlying BotAI object
    is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the manager is fully
    initialized with valid recovery data. Always check for proper initialization before
    using the manager's methods. Accessing the manager after the bot has been destroyed
    may result in undefined behavior.
