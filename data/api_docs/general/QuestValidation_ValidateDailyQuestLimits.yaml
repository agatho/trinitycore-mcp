documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can accept a daily quest based on their current
    daily quest limits
  description: The ValidateDailyQuestLimits method checks if a player is allowed to
    accept a specific daily quest by verifying against their current daily quest count
    and limits. This method ensures that players cannot exceed the maximum number
    of daily quests they are permitted to complete per day, which is a core game mechanic
    in World of Warcraft to balance quest progression and prevent quest spamming.
    The validation considers both the player's current daily quest log and any restrictions
    imposed by the quest system itself.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the daily quest being validated for acceptance
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      accept the quest
  returns: Returns true if the player can accept the daily quest, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that either the player has already reached their
    daily quest limit or there are other validation failures preventing quest acceptance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateDailyQuestLimits(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot accept the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have reached\
      \ your daily quest limit.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (quest->IsDaily())\
      \ {\n        if (!sQuestValidation->ValidateDailyQuestLimits(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ this)) {\n            SendQuestInvalidation(quest->GetQuestId());\n      \
      \      return;\n        }\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance\
      \ logic\n    Player::OnQuestAccept(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the quest acceptance process before
    allowing a player to take on a new daily quest. The implementation likely checks
    against internal counters maintained by the player's quest log and compares them
    against server configuration limits for daily quests. Performance considerations
    should be minimal as this is a simple validation check, but it may involve database
    lookups depending on how daily quest tracking is implemented.
  warnings: This method assumes that the player object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. Calling with a null player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Additionally, this validation only applies to daily quests;
    regular quests should be validated through different mechanisms.
