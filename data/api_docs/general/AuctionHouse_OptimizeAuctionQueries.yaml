  brief: Optimizes database queries used by the auction house system for improved
    performance.
  description: The OptimizeAuctionQueries method enhances the efficiency of database
    operations within the auction house subsystem. It typically involves restructuring
    or precomputing query results to reduce latency and resource consumption when
    players interact with the auction house interface. This optimization may include
    caching frequently accessed data, minimizing redundant database calls, or applying
    query hints to improve execution plans. The method is usually invoked during server
    startup or maintenance windows to ensure optimal performance without impacting
    live gameplay.
