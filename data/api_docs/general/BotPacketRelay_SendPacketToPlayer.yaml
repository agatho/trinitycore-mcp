  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: SendPacketToPlayer
  signature: bool BotPacketRelay::SendPacketToPlayer(Player * player, const WorldPacket
    * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to a specified player.
  description: The SendPacketToPlayer method is responsible for transmitting a WorldPacket
    to a specific Player object within the TrinityCore framework. This method serves
    as a core communication mechanism between the server and client, enabling the
    delivery of game data, updates, and commands to individual players. It handles
    the underlying network transmission logic and ensures that packets are properly
    formatted and sent over the player's connection. The method is typically used
    by bot systems or other server components that need to communicate directly with
    players.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object to which the packet will be sent. Must
      not be null.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket containing the data to be transmitted.
      Must not be null and should contain valid packet data.
  returns: Returns true if the packet was successfully queued for transmission, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the player is disconnected
    or the packet could not be processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to send a packet to a player
    code: "WorldPacket packet(SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD, 4);\npacket << uint32(12345);\n\
      BotPacketRelay relay;\nPlayer* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player reference\n\
      bool result = relay.SendPacketToPlayer(targetPlayer, &packet);\nif (!result)\
      \ {\n    // Handle send failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a custom packet with multiple data fields
    code: "WorldPacket packet(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN, 4);\npacket << uint32(123456789);\n\
      packet << uint32(0);\npacket << uint32(0);\nBotPacketRelay relay;\nPlayer* player\
      \ = ...; // Player reference\nbool success = relay.SendPacketToPlayer(player,\
      \ &packet);\nif (success) {\n    // Packet sent successfully\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Log error or handle failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's packet handling
    system and relies on the underlying network layer to deliver packets. It is important
    to ensure that the WorldPacket being sent is properly constructed with valid opcode
    and data. The method does not guarantee immediate delivery, as it may queue the
    packet for transmission depending on the current connection state.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for either player or packet parameters, as this
    will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Be cautious when sending packets
    to players who might be disconnected or in an invalid state. Avoid sending large
    or malformed packets that could cause client-side issues or network congestion.
