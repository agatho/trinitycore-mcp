  method: GetNextRandomBGResetTime
  signature: time_t World::GetNextRandomBGResetTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unix timestamp of the next reset time for random battlegrounds.
  description: The GetNextRandomBGResetTime method retrieves the time at which the
    random battleground queue will be reset. This typically occurs once per day, and
    is used to determine when new random battlegrounds become available for players
    to join. The returned value represents a Unix timestamp that can be used to calculate
    the exact date and time of the next reset. This mechanism ensures that random
    battlegrounds are regularly refreshed, preventing long-term queue imbalances and
    maintaining game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of the next random battleground
    reset time. If no reset is scheduled, it may return 0 or a time in the past.
  examples:
  - title: Check when random BG reset occurs
    code: "time_t resetTime = sWorld->GetNextRandomBGResetTime();\nif (resetTime >\
      \ time(nullptr)) {\n    std::cout << \"Next random BG reset: \" << ctime(&resetTime);\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Random BG reset is due now.\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used by the server to manage battleground queue
    systems and ensure fair play. The reset time is usually set to midnight UTC or
    a similar daily interval. The returned timestamp can be converted to local time
    using standard C++ time functions like localtime() or gmtime().
