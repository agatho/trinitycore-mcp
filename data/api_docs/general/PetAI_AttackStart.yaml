  class: PetAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void PetAI::AttackStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for the pet AI.
  description: The AttackStart method is responsible for triggering the pet's attack
    behavior towards a given target. This method is typically invoked when the pet's
    AI determines that it should begin attacking a specific unit. It handles the transition
    of the pet from an idle or passive state to an active combat stance, initiating
    the attack sequence with appropriate animations and actions. The method ensures
    that the pet follows its owner's commands and adheres to the game's combat mechanics
    while engaging targets.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the pet should attack. This parameter
      must point to a valid Unit object representing an enemy or hostile creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: "void MyPetAI::OnOwnerCommand(Unit* target)\n{\n    AttackStart(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Target Validation
    code: "void PetAI::AttackStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Proceed with attack logic\n    me->SetTarget(target->GetGUID());\n\
      \    me->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core pet AI system in TrinityCore and integrates
    closely with the creature's combat state management. It assumes that the target
    unit is valid and accessible for attack operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is not null or invalid,
    as attempting to attack a non-existent or invalid target may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
