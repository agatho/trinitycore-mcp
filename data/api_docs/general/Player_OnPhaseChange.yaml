  signature: void Player::OnPhaseChange()
documentation:
  brief: Handles phase change events for the player character
  description: This method is invoked when a player's phase changes, allowing developers
    to respond to game state transitions. It typically occurs during zone transitions
    or when entering/exiting specific phase areas. The method serves as an event handler
    that can be overridden by subclasses to implement custom behavior when phases
    change. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics and
    ensuring that player interactions with world objects are correctly handled based
    on current phase.

  - title: Basic Phase Change Handler
    code: "class MyPlayer : public Player {\npublic:\n    void OnPhaseChange() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom logic when phase changes\n        if (GetPhaseMask()\
      \ & PHASE_MASK_1) {\n            // Handle specific phase\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's event handling system and should be implemented
    carefully to avoid performance issues. The method may be called multiple times
    per frame depending on phase changes, so developers should ensure it's efficient
    and doesn't cause unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method directly from other code; instead, override
    it in your custom Player subclass. Be cautious about modifying player state during
    phase change events as it can lead to game state inconsistencies or crashes.
