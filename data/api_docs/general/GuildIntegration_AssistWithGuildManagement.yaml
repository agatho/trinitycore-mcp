  method: AssistWithGuildManagement
  signature: void GuildIntegration::AssistWithGuildManagement(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Assists with guild management tasks by processing player-related guild operations.
  description: The AssistWithGuildManagement method is designed to handle various
    administrative tasks within a guild context. It processes player-related guild
    operations such as member promotions, demotions, invitations, and other management
    actions. This method typically acts as an intermediary between the game client
    and the guild management system, ensuring that player requests are properly validated
    and executed within the guild's rules and permissions framework. The method operates
    on a provided player reference to perform necessary guild-related actions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) who
      is requesting or performing guild management operations. This parameter must
      point to a valid player GUID value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Management Assistance
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AssistWithGuildManagement(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Player Requests
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\n\
      for (int playerId : playerIds) {\n    guildInt.AssistWithGuildManagement(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs validation checks on the player's guild permissions
    before executing any management operations. It may interact with internal guild
    data structures and should be called from within a valid game context where guild
    systems are initialized.
  warnings: The player parameter must point to a valid integer value representing
    a player GUID. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes in the game system.
