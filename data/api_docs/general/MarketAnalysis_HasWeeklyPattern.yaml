  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: HasWeeklyPattern
  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::HasWeeklyPattern(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified item exhibits a recurring weekly pattern in
    the market.
  description: The HasWeeklyPattern method checks if a given item ID has been identified
    as having a predictable weekly fluctuation trend within the game's economy. This
    functionality is typically used by market analysis systems to identify items that
    follow seasonal or cyclical demand patterns, such as those tied to weekly events,
    holidays, or recurring in-game activities. The method likely queries internal
    data structures or databases that track historical pricing and trading behavior
    for items over time. It returns true if a consistent weekly pattern has been detected
    for the specified item, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to check for weekly pattern behavior.
      This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry ID in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item has been identified as having a recurring
    weekly pattern in its market behavior; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item has a weekly pattern
    code: "if (marketAnalysis.HasWeeklyPattern(12345)) {\n    // Item 12345 follows\
      \ a weekly pattern\n    printf(\"Item has weekly pattern\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // No weekly pattern detected for item 12345\n    printf(\"No weekly pattern\
      \ detected\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on historical data tracking and may be computationally
    intensive if called frequently. It is recommended to cache results when checking
    multiple items or calling the function repeatedly within a short time frame.
