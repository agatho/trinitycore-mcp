documentation:
  brief: Resets all dispel-related statistics tracked by the DispelCoordinator instance.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and initializes all internal counters
    and tracking variables related to dispel operations within the DispelCoordinator.
    This method is typically invoked when a new dispel session begins or when statistics
    need to be reset for reporting purposes. It ensures that subsequent dispel events
    are recorded accurately without interference from previous data. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple
    utility function for statistic management.

  examples:
  - title: Resetting Statistics Before New Session
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ResetStatistics();

      // Statistics are now reset and ready for new dispel tracking'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new dispel session to ensure
    clean statistics. It is not thread-safe, so concurrent access from multiple threads
    must be handled externally.
