  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::HandleUpdateAccountData(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::UserClientUpdateAccountData
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and updates account data sent by the client for the current session.
  description: The HandleUpdateAccountData method is responsible for receiving and
    processing account data updates from the client. This method handles the serialization
    and storage of various account-specific information such as mail, achievements,
    quest progress, and other persistent player data. It ensures that any changes
    made by the player in-game are properly synchronized with the server's database.
    The method typically gets invoked when the client sends an update packet containing
    modified account data, and it performs necessary validation and persistence operations
    before acknowledging the update to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPackets::ClientConfig::UserClientUpdateAccountData packet
      containing the updated account data from the client. This packet includes serialized
      data structures representing various account state changes such as mail status,
      quest completion flags, and achievement progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleUpdateAccountData(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::UserClientUpdateAccountData&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the incoming account data update\n    _player->UpdateAccountData(packet);\n\
      \    // Send acknowledgment back to client\n    SendPacket(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::AccountDataTimes().Write());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core session management system and should be called
    only within the context of a valid WorldSession. The method performs automatic
    validation of incoming data to prevent malformed packets from corrupting account
    state. It's recommended that developers avoid direct calls to this method outside
    of packet handling contexts.
  warnings: Improper handling of account data updates can lead to data corruption
    or loss. Always ensure that the packet contains valid data before processing,
    and be cautious when modifying account state directly in this handler. This method
    should not be overridden without careful consideration of its impact on player
    data integrity.
