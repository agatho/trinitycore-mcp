  class: Puppet
  method: Puppet
  signature: void Puppet::Puppet(const SummonPropertiesEntry * properties, int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a puppet object with specified summon properties and owner reference.
  description: The Puppet method is used to initialize a puppet entity within the
    TrinityCore framework. It takes a SummonPropertiesEntry which defines the summon's
    behavior, duration, and other properties, along with an integer pointer to the
    owner of the puppet. This method is typically invoked during the creation or spawning
    of summoned creatures or objects that act as puppets under specific control mechanics.
    The initialization process sets up internal state variables and registers the
    puppet with appropriate systems for lifecycle management.
  parameters:
  - name: properties
    description: A pointer to a SummonPropertiesEntry structure that defines the summon's
      properties including duration, faction, and summon type. Must not be null.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the owner of the puppet. This
      typically refers to the GUID of the creature or player who summoned this puppet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Puppet Initialization
    code: 'SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sObjectMgr->GetSummonProperties(12345);

      int ownerGuid = 56789;

      Puppet* puppet = new Puppet();

      puppet->Puppet(props, &ownerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal summoning system and should only be called
    during object construction or initialization. The properties parameter must point
    to a valid SummonPropertiesEntry that has been loaded into memory by the game
    server.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'properties' will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure that the owner GUID is properly validated before passing
    it to this method.
