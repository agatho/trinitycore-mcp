  signature: bool InteractionContext::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the interaction context has expired based on its internal
    timer or state.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if an InteractionContext object is
    no longer valid for use. This typically occurs when the context's lifetime has
    exceeded a defined threshold, such as after a player has moved away from an interactable
    object or when a temporary interaction window has timed out. The method evaluates
    internal state variables to make this determination and returns true if the context
    should be considered stale or invalid, false otherwise. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's interaction system to prevent outdated interactions from
    being processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interaction context has expired and should no longer
    be used; returns false if the context is still valid for interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Interaction Handler
    code: "if (interactionContext->IsExpired()) {\n    // Handle expired context\n\
      \    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with valid interaction\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Expiry Before Processing Action
    code: "void ProcessPlayerInteraction(Player* player, InteractionContext* context)\
      \ {\n    if (context && !context->IsExpired()) {\n        // Safe to process\
      \ interaction\n        HandleValidInteraction(player, context);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Context expired or invalid\n        SendErrorToPlayer(player,\
      \ \"Interaction has expired.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during interaction loops to ensure
    that stale contexts are not processed. It's important to note that an expired
    context may still be referenced by other systems, so proper cleanup or invalidation
    should occur after this check.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-expired context will remain valid for the entire
    duration of an interaction. External factors such as player movement or server
    events could cause the context to become invalid between checks.
