documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CharacterCache class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the CharacterCache
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the cache exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access character-related data caching
    functionality, such as storing and retrieving player information, guild data,
    or other character-specific metadata. The returned instance manages in-memory
    caching of character records to improve performance by reducing database queries.
    This method is thread-safe and should be called whenever character cache operations
    are needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton CharacterCache instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during application startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Character Cache Instance
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::instance();

      Player* player = cache->GetPlayerByGuid(ObjectGuid(12345));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Character Cache for Player Data
    code: "CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::instance();\nif (cache)\n{\n  \
      \  // Retrieve cached player data\n    CachedPlayerData* playerData = cache->GetCachedPlayerData(12345);\n\
      \    if (playerData)\n    {\n        // Use cached data\n        std::string\
      \ playerName = playerData->GetName();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The CharacterCache singleton is initialized during server startup and maintains
    character data in memory for fast access. This implementation uses thread-safe
    access patterns to ensure concurrent access from multiple threads does not cause
    data corruption. The cache may automatically invalidate entries based on time-to-live
    or other policies.
  warnings: Do not manually delete the returned pointer as it's managed by the singleton
    pattern. Calling this method in a multithreaded environment is safe, but be aware
    that modifications to cached data should be synchronized if thread safety is required
    for specific operations.
