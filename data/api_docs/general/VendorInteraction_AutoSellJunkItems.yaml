  class: VendorInteraction
  method: AutoSellJunkItems
  signature: void VendorInteraction::AutoSellJunkItems(Player * player, uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sells all junk items in the player's inventory to the specified vendor.
  description: The AutoSellJunkItems method automatically identifies and sells all
    junk-quality items from a player's inventory to a vendor identified by the provided
    GUID. This functionality is typically used during vendor interactions to streamline
    the selling process for players, removing the need for manual item selection.
    The method checks each item in the player's inventory, determines if it is classified
    as junk (based on item quality and value), and then sells it to the vendor. It
    does not affect items that are bound or have special properties that prevent selling.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory will be checked for
      junk items to sell.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor to whom junk items will
      be sold.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      VendorInteraction::AutoSellJunkItems(player, vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor GUID is valid and corresponds to an active
    vendor in the game world. It performs no checks on whether the player is within
    range of the vendor or if the vendor accepts items for sale.
