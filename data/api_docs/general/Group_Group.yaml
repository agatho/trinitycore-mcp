documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Group object with default values and prepares it for use
    in the World of Warcraft instance.
  description: The Group constructor initializes a new group instance, setting up
    internal data structures and default member configurations. This method is typically
    invoked when creating a new group dynamically during gameplay, such as when a
    player forms a new party or raid. The constructor ensures that all necessary fields
    are properly initialized with default values, including group type, leader information,
    and member lists. It also sets up the group's internal state to be ready for adding
    members, handling loot distribution, and managing group permissions. This initialization
    is crucial for maintaining game integrity and ensuring proper group functionality
    within TrinityCore's framework.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Group instance
    code: 'Group* newGroup = new Group();

      // The group is now initialized and ready to be used

      // Members can be added using Group::AddMember()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Group initialization in player creation context
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Group* playerGroup = new Group();

      player->SetGroup(playerGroup);

      // The group is initialized and associated with the player

      // This allows for proper party/raid management'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Group constructor does not automatically assign a leader or add any members.
    It only initializes the basic structure. A valid group should have at least one
    member (the leader) before it can function properly in gameplay scenarios. The
    constructor sets up internal pointers and data structures but does not perform
    any network communication or database operations.
  warnings: Never use the Group constructor directly without proper context, as it
    may lead to memory leaks if not paired with appropriate cleanup methods. Also,
    be aware that a group created with this constructor is not automatically registered
    with the game world's group management system, so additional setup is required
    for it to be functional.
