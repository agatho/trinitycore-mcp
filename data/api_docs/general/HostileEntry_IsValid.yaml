documentation:
  brief: Checks if the hostile entry is valid and properly initialized
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a HostileEntry object contains
    valid data and has been properly initialized. This method typically verifies that
    the entry's internal state is consistent and that required fields are populated
    with valid values. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, hostile
    entries are used to track aggressive NPC behavior towards players or other entities,
    making this validation crucial for maintaining game logic integrity. The method
    performs checks on essential properties such as target validity, entry status,
    and internal consistency.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the HostileEntry is valid and properly initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the entry has not
    been properly set up or contains invalid data that would prevent proper hostile
    behavior execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "HostileEntry entry;\n// ... populate entry with data ...\nif (entry.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with hostile behavior logic\n    entry.ExecuteHostileAction();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid entry case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid hostile\
      \ entry detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Combat System
    code: "class CombatSystem {\npublic:\n    void ProcessHostileEntries(std::vector<HostileEntry>&\
      \ entries) {\n        for (auto& entry : entries) {\n            if (!entry.IsValid())\
      \ {\n                // Skip invalid entries\n                continue;\n  \
      \          }\n            // Process valid hostile entries\n            entry.PerformAttack();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before performing any operations on a HostileEntry
    to ensure data integrity. The validation logic may include checking for null pointers,
    verifying that required identifiers are set, and confirming that the entry's state
    is consistent with expected game mechanics. Performance-wise, this check should
    be lightweight as it's often called in performance-critical combat scenarios.
  warnings: Developers should not assume that all HostileEntry objects are valid.
    Always call IsValid() before using an entry in combat or behavior logic. Invalid
    entries can cause crashes or unexpected behavior if not properly validated first.
