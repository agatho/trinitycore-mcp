  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterInfoDeleted(const int & guid, bool
    deleted, const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the deletion status of a character in the cache with the provided
    GUID, name, and deletion state.
  description: The UpdateCharacterInfoDeleted method is responsible for updating the
    internal cache of character information within the TrinityCore server. It modifies
    the cached entry for a specific character identified by their GUID, marking whether
    the character has been deleted or not. This method ensures that the in-memory
    cache reflects the current state of character data in the database. The update
    includes the character's name and deletion status, allowing other subsystems to
    quickly access this information without querying the database directly. This is
    particularly useful for systems that need to track character availability or perform
    operations based on whether a character exists or has been removed from the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character whose cache entry needs
      to be updated. This is typically a 32-bit integer value that uniquely identifies
      each player or creature in the game world.
  - name: deleted
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the character has been deleted
      from the game. True indicates the character is marked as deleted, false indicates
      they are active.
  - name: name
    description: The current name of the character. This string value is used to update
      or verify the character's name in the cache entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Character as Deleted
    code: CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterInfoDeleted(12345, true, "JohnDoe");
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Character Status to Active
    code: CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterInfoDeleted(67890, false, "JaneSmith");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an in-memory cache and does not directly modify the
    database. Changes made through this method are only reflected in the server's
    memory until a subsequent database sync occurs. The implementation likely uses
    thread-safe mechanisms to prevent race conditions when multiple threads access
    or update character data simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an actual existing character
    before calling this method, as updating non-existent entries may cause undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that this method only updates the cache and does not
    perform any database operations, so changes will not persist across server restarts
    unless properly synchronized with the database.
