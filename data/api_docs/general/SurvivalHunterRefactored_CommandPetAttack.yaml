  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: CommandPetAttack
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::CommandPetAttack(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to attack a specified target.
  description: The CommandPetAttack method instructs the hunter's summoned pet to
    initiate an attack against the provided target. This method is typically used
    in AI logic for hunter classes, particularly in survival-focused gameplay where
    pets are essential for combat. The method likely handles pet state transitions
    and target assignment within the game's combat system. It may also trigger relevant
    pet behavior events or update the pet's AI state machine.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier (GUID) for
      the pet to attack. The value should correspond to a valid unit in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Attack Command
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      player->GetHunter()->CommandPetAttack(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pet Attack
    code: "if (target && target->IsAlive()) {\n    int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    player->GetHunter()->CommandPetAttack(&targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI subsystem and may require
    the pet to be active and under the hunter's control. The target parameter should
    reference a valid combatant in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before calling this
    method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer could cause undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method assumes the pet is already summoned and available for command.
