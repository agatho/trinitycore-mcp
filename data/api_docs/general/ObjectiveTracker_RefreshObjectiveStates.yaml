  class: ObjectiveTracker

  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::RefreshObjectiveStates(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the objective states for a player's quest tracker
  description: The RefreshObjectiveStates method updates and synchronizes the current
    state of all active objectives within a player's quest tracker. This includes
    updating progress, completing objectives, and ensuring that the UI reflects the
    most recent quest status. The method is typically invoked when quest conditions
    change or when the player's state needs to be refreshed to match the current game
    environment. It operates on a specific player instance provided as an argument,
    making it suitable for use in botting or automation scenarios where quest tracking
    must be manually updated.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest objectives need to be refreshed.
      This parameter is required and must point to a valid Player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Refresh objectives for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      ObjectiveTracker::RefreshObjectiveStates(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a bot context to update quest progress
    code: "void UpdateBotQuests(Player* bot)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker::RefreshObjectiveStates(bot);\n\
      \    // Additional logic to handle updated objectives\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger UI updates for the player's quest log. It should
    be called carefully in performance-sensitive contexts, such as during bot operation,
    to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is valid and in a usable
    state before invoking this method.
