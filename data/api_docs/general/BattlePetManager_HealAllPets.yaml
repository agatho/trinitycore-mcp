  class: BattlePetManager
  method: HealAllPets
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::HealAllPets(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Heals all battle pets owned by the specified player.
  description: The HealAllPets method restores full health to all active battle pets
    belonging to a given player. This method is typically used in game mechanics where
    players need to restore their pets' health without manually healing each one individually.
    The function operates on the player's current battle pet roster and ensures that
    all pets are fully healed. It may be invoked during specific game events, upon
    player login, or as part of a larger healing routine. The method returns a boolean
    value indicating whether the operation was successful.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's battle pets should be healed.
  returns: Returns true if all battle pets were successfully healed, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the specified player does not exist or has no active
    battle pets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HealAllPets
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool success = battlePetManager->HealAllPets(&playerId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    printf(\"All pets healed successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to heal pets.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to
    an existing player in the game world. It may not handle cases where pets are in
    combat or otherwise restricted from being healed.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this function,
    as passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the player actually owns battle pets before invoking this method to avoid
    unnecessary processing.
