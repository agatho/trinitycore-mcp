documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the StrategyChromosome class with default values.
  description: The StrategyChromosome constructor initializes a new chromosome object
    used in AI decision-making algorithms within the TrinityCore framework. This class
    represents a single strategy configuration that can be evaluated and evolved through
    genetic algorithm processes. The constructor sets up internal data structures
    and default parameters necessary for strategy evaluation, including fitness tracking,
    gene representation, and evolutionary metadata. It prepares the chromosome for
    integration into population-based AI systems where multiple strategies are tested
    and refined over time.

  examples:
  - title: Basic StrategyChromosome Initialization
    code: 'StrategyChromosome chromosome;

      // Creates a new chromosome with default configuration

      // Ready for use in AI strategy evaluation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when creating
    new chromosomes during population initialization or genetic algorithm operations.
    The chromosome's genes are initialized to default values and fitness metrics are
    set to initial states suitable for evaluation.
