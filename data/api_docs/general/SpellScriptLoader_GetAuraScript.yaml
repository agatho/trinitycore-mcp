documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new instance of an AuraScript for spell effects.
  description: The GetAuraScript method is a virtual function in the SpellScriptLoader
    class that is responsible for instantiating and returning a new AuraScript object.
    This method is typically overridden by derived classes to provide specific aura
    script implementations for spells. It serves as a factory pattern for creating
    aura scripts, which are used to define custom behavior for spell effects such
    as periodic damage, healing, or stat modifications. The returned AuraScript instance
    will be managed by the TrinityCore framework and attached to the appropriate spell
    aura.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a newly created AuraScript object that implements the specific
    aura behavior for a spell. Returns nullptr if the script creation fails or if
    no valid aura script is associated with this loader.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AuraScript Loader Implementation
    code: "class MyAuraScriptLoader : public SpellScriptLoader\n{\npublic:\n    MyAuraScriptLoader()\
      \ : SpellScriptLoader(\"MyAuraScript\") {}\n    \n    AuraScript* GetAuraScript()\
      \ const override\n    {\n        return new MyAuraScript();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called by the TrinityCore framework during spell initialization
    when a spell requires aura script functionality. Developers should ensure that
    the returned AuraScript object is properly constructed and does not leak memory,
    as the framework manages its lifetime. The method should be thread-safe if used
    in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Do not return null pointers unless explicitly handled by the calling code.
    Improper implementation can lead to crashes or undefined behavior when the aura
    script is applied to spells.
