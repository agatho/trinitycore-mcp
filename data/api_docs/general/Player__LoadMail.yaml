  notes: The method should be called during player initialization or when loading
    mail data from database. It is important to note that this method is part of the
    internal player mail system and should not be directly invoked by external code
    unless specifically required. Performance considerations include database query
    optimization and memory management for loaded mail data.
  warnings: This method should only be called during appropriate game state transitions,
    such as character loading or when retrieving mail data from database. Improper
    usage may lead to data inconsistencies or memory leaks. Care should be taken when
    handling different result codes as they may indicate success or failure of various
    mail components.
