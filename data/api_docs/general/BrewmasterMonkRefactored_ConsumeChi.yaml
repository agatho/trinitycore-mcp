  class: BrewmasterMonkRefactored
  method: ConsumeChi
  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::ConsumeChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of Chi resource from the Brewmaster Monk.
  description: The ConsumeChi method reduces the current Chi resource level of a Brewmaster
    Monk by the provided amount. This method is typically used during ability execution
    or passive mechanics that require Chi consumption. The method ensures that the
    Chi value does not drop below zero, and may trigger visual effects or gameplay
    feedback when Chi is consumed. It's an integral part of managing the Monk's resource
    system within the Brewmaster specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of Chi to consume from the Monk's current resource pool.
      Must be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Consumption
    code: 'BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monk = ...;

      monk->ConsumeChi(10); // Consumes 10 units of Chi'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Consumption
    code: "BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monk = ...;\nif (monk->GetChi() >= 5)\n{\n  \
      \  monk->ConsumeChi(5); // Only consume if sufficient Chi is available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Monk's internal resource tracking system
    and may update UI elements or trigger animations. It should be called only when
    the Monk has sufficient Chi to avoid negative values.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available Chi may lead to unexpected
    behavior if the requested amount exceeds current resources. Ensure proper validation
    before consumption.
