  class: MapEntry
  method: IsFlexLocking
  signature: bool MapEntry::IsFlexLocking() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry is configured for flexible locking behavior.
  description: The IsFlexLocking method checks if a MapEntry object has the flexible
    locking flag enabled. This flag typically controls whether the map allows dynamic
    or flexible locking mechanisms, such as those used in certain raid instances or
    scenario-based content where lock states may change during gameplay. The method
    returns true if the map is configured to support flexible locking, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in TrinityCore's instance management system
    to determine how player access and locking behavior should be handled for specific
    maps.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the map entry supports flexible
    locking. True indicates that flexible locking is enabled for this map, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry supports flexible locking
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry && entry->IsFlexLocking())\
      \ {\n    // Handle flexible locking logic\n    printf(\"Map %u supports flexible\
      \ locking\\n\", mapId);\n} else {\n    // Handle standard locking behavior\n\
      \    printf(\"Map %u uses standard locking\\n\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management and
    player access control systems. The flexible locking behavior may affect how players
    are granted or removed from instances, particularly in dynamic content such as
    raids or scenarios where lock states can change during the encounter.
