  class: LootDistribution
  method: RecommendLootSettings
  signature: void LootDistribution::RecommendLootSettings(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets recommended loot distribution settings for a group based on current
    group composition and loot rules.
  description: The RecommendLootSettings method configures optimal loot distribution
    parameters for a specified group within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    analyzes the group's composition, member roles, and current loot rules to determine
    appropriate distribution settings such as loot threshold, master looter, and group
    loot modes. It ensures that loot is distributed according to established World
    of Warcraft group loot mechanics, taking into account player levels, gear requirements,
    and raid policies. The method typically executes during group creation or when
    group composition changes significantly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Creation
    code: 'Group* myGroup = new Group();

      // ... add players to group ...

      LootDistribution::RecommendLootSettings(myGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Loot Settings After Player Join
    code: "Group* existingGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (existingGroup)\n\
      {\n    // Add new player to group\n    Player* newPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(playerGuid);\n\
      \    if (newPlayer && existingGroup->AddMember(newPlayer))\n    {\n        LootDistribution::RecommendLootSettings(existingGroup);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the group management system
    when group composition changes. Developers should be aware that this method modifies
    internal group state and may trigger UI updates for all group members. The implementation
    considers various factors including player level differences, item quality thresholds,
    and existing loot rules.
  warnings: Calling this method directly on groups with active loot operations may
    cause unexpected behavior or conflicts with ongoing loot distribution processes.
    Ensure that the group is in a stable state before calling this method.
