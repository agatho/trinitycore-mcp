  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetMemoryUsage
  signature: size_t GroupCoordinator::GetMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of the group coordinator instance
    in bytes.
  description: The GetMemoryUsage method provides a snapshot of the current memory
    consumption by the GroupCoordinator object. This includes all dynamically allocated
    memory used internally by the group coordinator, such as player references, group
    data structures, and associated metadata. The method is typically used for debugging,
    performance monitoring, or memory profiling purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
    It performs a recursive calculation across all managed components to provide an
    accurate total memory footprint. The returned value represents the size in bytes
    of all memory currently allocated by this specific GroupCoordinator instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes of the GroupCoordinator
    instance. This value includes all heap-allocated memory used internally by the
    object, including any containers, data structures, and dynamic allocations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();

      size_t memoryUsed = coordinator->GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Group coordinator is using %zu bytes of memory", memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Memory Profiling in Performance Monitoring
    code: "void LogGroupCoordinatorMemoryUsage()\n{\n    GroupCoordinator* coordinator\
      \ = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();\n    if (coordinator)\n    {\n\
      \        size_t usage = coordinator->GetMemoryUsage();\n        if (usage >\
      \ 1024 * 1024) // 1MB threshold\n        {\n            TC_LOG_WARN(\"group\"\
      , \"High memory usage detected: %zu bytes\", usage);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve traversing multiple internal data structures and
    could have performance implications if called frequently. It's recommended to
    use this method sparingly in performance-critical code paths. The memory calculation
    includes all dynamic allocations but excludes any static or compile-time allocated
    memory.
  warnings: The returned memory usage value is only valid at the time of the call
    and may change immediately after due to group operations. Do not rely on this
    value for real-time memory management decisions, as it's primarily intended for
    diagnostic purposes.
