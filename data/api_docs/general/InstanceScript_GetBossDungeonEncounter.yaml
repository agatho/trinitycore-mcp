    Creature * creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dungeon encounter entry associated with a given creature in
    the instance.
  description: The GetBossDungeonEncounter method is used to obtain the DungeonEncounterEntry
    that corresponds to a specific creature within an instance script. This function
    is typically invoked during boss encounters or when handling creature-related
    events to determine which dungeon encounter the creature is part of. It allows
    scripts to access detailed information about the encounter, such as encounter
    ID, associated achievements, and other metadata relevant to the boss fight. The
    method relies on internal mappings between creatures and their respective dungeon
    encounters defined in the game's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const DungeonEncounterEntry structure if the creature is
    associated with a valid dungeon encounter; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching
    entry is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Encounter Handling
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCreatureDeath(Creature*\
      \ creature) override\n    {\n        const DungeonEncounterEntry* encounter\
      \ = GetBossDungeonEncounter(creature);\n        if (encounter)\n        {\n\
      \            // Process encounter-specific logic\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Encounter %u completed.\", encounter->ID);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature passed to it is part of a valid dungeon
    encounter. It internally uses mappings defined in the game's database and relies
    on proper initialization of the instance script. The returned pointer should not
    be modified or freed by the caller.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature parameter is valid and belongs to the current
    instance before calling this method, as passing an invalid creature may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect results.
