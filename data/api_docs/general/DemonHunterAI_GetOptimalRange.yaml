  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float DemonHunterAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the Demon Hunter AI based
    on current target and spell availability.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    Demon Hunter should engage their target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account the AI's current target, available spells, and combat mechanics
    specific to the Demon Hunter class. The returned float value represents the distance
    in yards where the Demon Hunter should position themselves for optimal damage
    output or spell casting efficiency. This method is typically used internally by
    the AI system to make decisions about movement and positioning during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier. This
      parameter is used to retrieve the current target of the Demon Hunter AI for
      range calculation purposes.
  returns: Returns a float value indicating the optimal combat range in yards. The
    value represents the distance at which the Demon Hunter should position themselves
    relative to their target for maximum effectiveness. A return value of 0.0 typically
    indicates an error condition or invalid target state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = demonHunterAI->GetOptimalRange(&targetId);\nif (optimalRange\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Move to calculated range\n    unit->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using return value for spell targeting logic
    code: "int target = 12345;\nfloat range = demonHunterAI->GetOptimalRange(&target);\n\
      if (range > 0.0f && unit->GetDistance(target) > range)\n{\n    // Move closer\
      \ to optimal range\n    unit->MoveTowards(target, range - unit->GetDistance(target));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI system and relies on internal
    state tracking. The calculation may vary based on current spell cooldowns, available
    abilities, and target type. The method assumes that a valid target exists and
    is accessible through the provided pointer.
  warnings: The method may return 0.0f if no valid target is found or if the target
    is invalid. Always check for this condition before using the returned value. The
    target parameter must point to a valid integer identifier, otherwise behavior
    is undefined.
