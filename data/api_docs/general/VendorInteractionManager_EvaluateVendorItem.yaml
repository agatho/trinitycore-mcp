  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: EvaluateVendorItem
  signature: VendorItemEvaluation VendorInteractionManager::EvaluateVendorItem(Creature
    * vendor, const ItemTemplate * item, uint32 vendorSlot) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates a vendor item to determine its availability, pricing, and other
    properties.
  description: The EvaluateVendorItem method assesses a specific item offered by a
    vendor creature, determining whether the item is available for purchase, its cost
    in copper, and any additional conditions or restrictions. This method is typically
    used during vendor interactions to validate item offerings and prepare transaction
    data. It checks against internal vendor item lists, player requirements, and currency
    limitations to ensure accurate representation of what a vendor can offer at any
    given time.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor offering the
      item.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the ItemTemplate structure defining the properties of
      the item being evaluated.
  - name: vendorSlot
    description: The slot index within the vendor's inventory from which the item
      originates, used for identifying specific item entries.
  returns: Returns a VendorItemEvaluation struct containing details about the item's
    availability, cost in copper, and other relevant properties such as stack size
    or required reputation level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic vendor item evaluation
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // Assume valid vendor\nItemTemplate* item = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      VendorItemEvaluation eval = vendorInteractionManager.EvaluateVendorItem(vendor,\
      \ item, 0);\nif (eval.IsAvailable)\n{\n    printf(\"Item costs %u copper\\n\"\
      , eval.Cost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks against the vendor's item list and may involve
    database lookups or cached data. It is intended for use during active vendor interactions
    and should not be called outside of appropriate contexts to avoid performance
    penalties.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers for vendor or item may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all inputs are validated
    before calling this function.
