  brief: Refunds rune power to the player when a spell is canceled or fails.
  description: This method refunds the rune power that was consumed by a spell when
    the spell is canceled or fails. It is typically used in conjunction with spell
    cancellation logic to restore the player's rune resources. The method ensures
    that the player's rune power is properly restored, maintaining game balance and
    preventing resource exploitation. This function is commonly invoked during spell
    failure scenarios or when spells are interrupted.

  notes: The method is typically called when a spell fails or is canceled, ensuring
    proper resource management. It should be invoked only when the spell's effects
    are not applied to prevent unnecessary refunding.

    been consumed and applied. Improper usage may lead to incorrect resource restoration.
