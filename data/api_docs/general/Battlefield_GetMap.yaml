  class: Battlefield
  method: GetMap
  signature: Map * Battlefield::GetMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the Map object associated with this Battlefield instance.
  description: The GetMap method retrieves the Map object that represents the game
    world map where this Battlefield instance is located. This method is commonly
    used in battlefield-related systems to access map-specific data, such as terrain
    information, spawn points, or zone boundaries. The returned pointer can be used
    to query various map properties and perform operations related to the battlefield's
    geographical context within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Map object associated with this Battlefield instance.
    Returns nullptr if the battlefield is not properly initialized or associated with
    a valid map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access battlefield map data
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    Map* map = bf->GetMap();\n    if (map)\n    {\n        // Use\
      \ map data for battlefield operations\n        uint32 mapId = map->GetId();\n\
      \        // ... perform operations with the map\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking map validity before using it
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      Map* map = bf ? bf->GetMap() : nullptr;\nif (map && map->IsEnabled())\n{\n \
      \   // Safe to use the map object\n    // Access map-specific battlefield data\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or disabled map case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battlefield management code where access
    to map context is required. The returned Map pointer should be validated before
    use, as it may be null if the battlefield has not been properly initialized or
    if the associated map has been unloaded.
  warnings: Always check for null return values when using this method, as the battlefield
    might not be associated with a valid map at all times. Using an invalid Map pointer
    can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
