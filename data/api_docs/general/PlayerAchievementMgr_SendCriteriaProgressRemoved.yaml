  method: SendCriteriaProgressRemoved
  signature: void PlayerAchievementMgr::SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(uint32 criteriaId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the player's client indicating that a criteria progress
    has been removed from an achievement.
  description: The SendCriteriaProgressRemoved method is used by the PlayerAchievementMgr
    class to notify the player's client that a specific criteria associated with an
    achievement has been removed or reset. This typically occurs when an achievement's
    criteria is no longer valid, such as when a quest is abandoned, a requirement
    is no longer met, or when a criteria is manually cleared from the achievement
    system. The method sends a packet to the client that updates the UI to reflect
    the removal of progress for the specified criteria ID. It is part of the broader
    achievement tracking and synchronization mechanism within TrinityCore's player
    management system.
  parameters:
  - name: criteriaId
    description: The unique identifier of the criteria whose progress has been removed
      from an achievement. This value corresponds to the CriteriaID field in the dbc
      file or database entries for achievements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing criteria progress after quest abandonment
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAbandon(uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Remove criteria\
      \ related to the abandoned quest\n    if (PlayerAchievementMgr* mgr = GetAchievementMgr())\n\
      \    {\n        mgr->SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(12345); // Example criteria\
      \ ID\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's achievement UI and should
    only be called when a criteria is legitimately removed from an achievement. It
    does not modify database records or internal achievement state; it only sends
    a network packet to update the player's view.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may cause UI desynchronization
    between the server and client. Ensure that the criteria ID is valid and corresponds
    to an actual tracked criteria before invoking this method.
