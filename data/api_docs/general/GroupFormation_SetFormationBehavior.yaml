  method: SetFormationBehavior
  signature: void GroupFormation::SetFormationBehavior(FormationBehavior behavior)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation behavior for a group, defining how members should position
    themselves relative to the leader.
  description: The SetFormationBehavior method configures the tactical positioning
    strategy that a group will use during movement and combat. This method allows
    developers to specify whether group members should maintain a specific formation
    such as line, circle, or scatter around the group leader. The behavior affects
    how NPCs and players move in groups, particularly in scenarios like boss encounters,
    quest events, or scripted movements where coordinated positioning is required.
    This setting is typically used in conjunction with other group management functions
    to create complex AI behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: behavior
    description: The FormationBehavior enum value that defines the desired formation
      pattern. Valid values include LINE, CIRCLE, SCATTER, and others depending on
      implementation. This parameter determines how group members will position themselves
      relative to the leader during movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Group to Line Formation
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SetFormationBehavior(FormationBehavior::LINE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Formation for Boss Encounter
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\n\
      \    if (formation) {\n        formation->SetFormationBehavior(FormationBehavior::CIRCLE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group's formation system.
    It does not immediately affect existing movement paths but will influence future
    positioning decisions. The behavior change is persistent until explicitly modified
    again.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null group or without proper group initialization
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is actually part of a
    group before attempting to set formation behavior.
