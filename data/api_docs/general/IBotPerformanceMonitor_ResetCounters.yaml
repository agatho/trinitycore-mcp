  method: ResetCounters
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::ResetCounters()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all performance counters tracked by the bot performance monitor to
    their initial state.
  description: The ResetCounters method clears and initializes all internal performance
    tracking metrics within the IBotPerformanceMonitor interface. This includes resetting
    accumulated data such as execution times, call counts, and other statistical measurements
    that are used to monitor bot behavior and performance. The method is typically
    invoked when starting a new monitoring session or when it's necessary to clear
    previous measurement data. It ensures that subsequent performance measurements
    start from a clean baseline without any influence from prior tracking sessions.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      monitor->ResetCounters();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before beginning a new performance measurement
    cycle to ensure accurate results. It is generally safe to call from any thread
    context, though the specific thread safety guarantees depend on the implementation
    of the concrete class that implements IBotPerformanceMonitor.
