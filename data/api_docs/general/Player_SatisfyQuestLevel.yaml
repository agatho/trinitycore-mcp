  method: SatisfyQuestLevel
  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestLevel(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Satisfies a quest's level requirements for the player.
  description: This method checks whether the player meets the level requirements
    specified by a given quest. It evaluates the quest's level constraints against
    the player's current level and returns true if the requirements are satisfied,
    false otherwise. The method is commonly used during quest completion validation
    to ensure players have sufficient level to accept or complete quests. If the 'msg'
    parameter is set to true, it also sends appropriate messages to the player about
    level requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object whose level requirements are being checked
      against the player's current level.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send messages to the player about
      level requirements. If true, messages will be displayed; if false, no messages
      will be sent.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets the quest's level requirements, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the player's level is below the minimum
    required level or above the maximum required level for the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestLevel(quest, true);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Player meets quest level requirements\n    // Proceed with quest completion\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to validate player's eligibility for quest completion. It does not modify any
    player state or quest data; it simply evaluates the current player level against
    quest requirements.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking quest completion conditions,
    as incorrect usage may lead to players being unable to complete quests despite
    having sufficient level. Ensure that quest level requirements are properly validated
    before calling this method.
