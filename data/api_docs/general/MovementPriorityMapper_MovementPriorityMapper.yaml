documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MovementPriorityMapper class with default
    settings.
  description: The MovementPriorityMapper constructor initializes the internal state
    of the movement priority mapping system. This class is responsible for determining
    and managing movement priorities for various game entities such as players, creatures,
    and game objects within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor sets up default
    mappings and prepares the object for use in pathfinding and movement logic. It
    ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized
    before any movement priority calculations are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Instantiation
    code: 'MovementPriorityMapper mapper;

      // The mapper is now ready to be used for movement priority calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    It primarily sets up internal data structures and default mappings. The actual
    movement priority calculations are typically performed by other methods in the
    class rather than during construction.
