  method: GetArenaMatchmakerRating
  signature: int Battleground::GetArenaMatchmakerRating(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena matchmaker rating for a specified team in the battleground.
  description: The GetArenaMatchmakerRating method returns the current matchmaker
    rating (MMR) of a specific team within an arena battleground. This value is used
    by the matchmaking system to balance teams and determine player eligibility for
    various arena brackets. The method takes a team identifier as input and returns
    the corresponding MMR value, which typically ranges from 0 to several thousand
    depending on the player's skill level and ranking history. This rating directly
    influences how players are matched against each other in ranked arena play.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to retrieve the matchmaker rating.
      Valid values are typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, though exact values
      may depend on the battleground type and implementation details.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the arena matchmaker rating for the specified
    team. A higher value indicates a stronger team with better performance history.
    The return value is typically in the range of 0-5000+ depending on the player's
    ranking, or -1 if the team identifier is invalid or the battleground does not
    support arena ratings.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Alliance Team Rating
    code: "int allianceRating = bg->GetArenaMatchmakerRating(0);\nif (allianceRating\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the rating for matchmaking or display purposes\n    printf(\"\
      Alliance team MMR: %d\\n\", allianceRating);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Compare Team Ratings
    code: "int allianceRating = bg->GetArenaMatchmakerRating(0);\nint hordeRating\
      \ = bg->GetArenaMatchmakerRating(1);\n\nif (allianceRating >= 0 && hordeRating\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    if (abs(allianceRating - hordeRating) < 100)\n    {\n      \
      \  printf(\"Teams are well-balanced for this match.\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Significant rating difference detected.\\n\");\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in arena battlegrounds and may return -1 for
    non-arena battleground types. The returned values are typically updated during
    the battleground lifecycle, particularly after player registration and before
    match start. Developers should ensure that the team parameter is valid before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on a battleground that does not support arena matchmaking
    may return invalid data or cause undefined behavior. Always validate the return
    value before using it in calculations or UI display logic.
