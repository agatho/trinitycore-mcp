documentation:
  brief: Loads Mythic+ affix overrides for the specified affix ID into the database.
  description: The LoadMythicPlusAffixOverrides method is responsible for loading
    and applying custom affix overrides for Mythic+ dungeons. This method retrieves
    configuration data related to specific affixes and updates the database with any
    override values that modify default affix behavior. It ensures that custom settings
    defined by server administrators or content creators are properly integrated into
    the game's Mythic+ system. The method typically operates during server startup
    or when new affix configurations are applied, updating internal caches and database
    records to reflect the current override state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization or when affix
    configurations are updated. It's important to ensure that the affix ID passed
    exists in the database, otherwise the operation may silently fail or produce unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid affix ID may result in undefined behavior or database
    corruption if not properly validated. This method should only be called when the
    database is ready for modifications and thread-safe operations are guaranteed.
