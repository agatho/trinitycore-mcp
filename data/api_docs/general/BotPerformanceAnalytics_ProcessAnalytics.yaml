  method: ProcessAnalytics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::ProcessAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Processes and analyzes bot performance data for reporting and optimization
    purposes.
  description: The ProcessAnalytics method in the BotPerformanceAnalytics class aggregates
    and evaluates various performance metrics related to AI-controlled bots within
    the TrinityCore environment. This method typically collects data such as response
    times, decision-making efficiency, pathfinding accuracy, and resource utilization.
    It is designed to support real-time monitoring and post-processing analysis for
    improving bot behavior and overall game balance. The method may also trigger alerts
    or logging events when performance thresholds are exceeded. This functionality
    is crucial for developers and administrators who need to maintain optimal bot
    performance in World of Warcraft servers.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.ProcessAnalytics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically or upon specific events to ensure
    continuous performance monitoring. It may involve significant computational overhead,
    especially when processing large numbers of bots simultaneously. The implementation
    might utilize internal data structures for storing and retrieving performance
    metrics.
  warnings: Improper handling of performance data could lead to memory leaks or incorrect
    analytics reporting. Ensure that this method is not called too frequently in performance-critical
    sections of code without proper throttling mechanisms.
