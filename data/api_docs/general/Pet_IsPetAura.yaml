  class: Pet
  method: IsPetAura
  signature: bool Pet::IsPetAura(const int * aura)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given aura is a pet-specific aura.
  description: The IsPetAura method checks if a specified aura ID corresponds to an
    aura that is exclusively associated with pets in World of Warcraft. This function
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to differentiate between player
    auras and pet auras, ensuring proper handling of pet-specific effects such as
    buffs, debuffs, or passive abilities. The method evaluates the provided aura identifier
    against a predefined list or set of pet-related auras and returns true if the
    aura is classified as a pet aura, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining correct behavior in pet management systems, particularly when
    applying or removing auras from summoned creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: aura
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the aura ID to be checked. The
      value should correspond to a valid aura entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura is a pet-specific aura; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an Aura is Pet-Specific
    code: "int petAuraId = 12345;\nif (pet->IsPetAura(&petAuraId)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ pet-specific aura logic\n    printf(\"This aura affects only pets\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle regular aura logic\n    printf(\"This aura does not\
      \ affect pets\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely relies on internal mappings or lookup tables within the
    TrinityCore codebase that define which auras are considered pet-specific. Developers
    should ensure that the aura ID passed to this function is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the database.
