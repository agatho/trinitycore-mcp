  class: EconomyManager
  method: CanLearnRecipe
  signature: bool EconomyManager::CanLearnRecipe(uint32 recipeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player can learn a specified recipe.
  description: The CanLearnRecipe method determines whether the player associated
    with the EconomyManager instance has the necessary prerequisites to learn a specific
    crafting recipe. This includes checking if the recipe is already known, if the
    player meets the required skill level, and if any other conditions such as quest
    completion or reputation requirements are satisfied. The method performs these
    checks without modifying the player's state or recipe list.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can learn the specified recipe; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false typically indicates that the recipe is already
    known, the player lacks required skill level, or other prerequisites are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (economyMgr->CanLearnRecipe(12345)) {\n    // Player can learn recipe\
      \ 12345\n    // Proceed with learning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Recipe Learning
    code: "uint32 recipeId = 98765;\nif (economyMgr->CanLearnRecipe(recipeId)) {\n\
      \    // Add recipe to player's known recipes\n    player->AddKnownRecipe(recipeId);\n\
      \    // Send success message to player\n} else {\n    // Send failure message\
      \ or log reason\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any side effects such as modifying the player's
    recipe list or skill levels. It is purely a query function that evaluates conditions
    and returns a boolean result. The implementation likely checks against internal
    data structures representing player knowledge, skill requirements, and other game
    state elements.
