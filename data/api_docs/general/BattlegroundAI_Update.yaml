  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: Update
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::Update(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground AI state based on elapsed time and player data
  description: The Update method is a core component of the BattlegroundAI class responsible
    for processing AI logic during battleground gameplay. It handles time-based updates,
    player state management, and coordination of battleground events. The method is
    typically called by the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that battleground
    mechanics operate correctly. This implementation likely manages objectives, scoring,
    player interactions, and victory conditions within the context of a battleground
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      being processed by the AI
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last update, used for time-based
      calculations and smooth gameplay progression
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic battleground AI update call
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::Update(int* player, uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ time-based events\n    if (m_timer > 0)\n        m_timer -= diff;\n    \n\
      \    // Handle player state updates\n    if (player && *player >= 0)\n     \
      \   HandlePlayerUpdate(*player, diff);\n    \n    // Update battleground objectives\n\
      \    UpdateObjectives(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently during battleground gameplay and should
    avoid heavy computations to maintain performance. The 'diff' parameter represents
    the actual time elapsed since last call, making it suitable for frame-rate independent
    updates. Implementation may involve checking player positions, updating timers,
    managing respawn logic, and handling victory conditions.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter can cause timing-related bugs
    in battleground mechanics. The method should not perform operations that could
    block the main game thread for extended periods as it's called from the game loop.
