documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all Cataclysm-era dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior
    system.
  description: The LoadCataclysmDungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all dungeon-related data specific to the Cataclysm expansion (Wrath of the Lich
    King content). This method typically populates internal data structures with information
    about dungeon IDs, spawn locations, quest requirements, and other mechanics relevant
    to Cataclysm dungeons. It ensures that the DungeonBehavior system has access to
    all necessary data to manage player encounters, loot distribution, and dungeon
    completion tracking for these specific content areas. The method is usually invoked
    during server startup or when expansion-specific systems are initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadCataclysmDungeons();

      // Dungeon data is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or reads from configuration
    files to populate dungeon information. It may be called only once during server
    initialization, and subsequent calls might be ignored or result in no-op behavior.
    The method should not be called while active dungeon instances are running to
    avoid data inconsistency.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively participating in Cataclysm
    dungeons could lead to undefined behavior or data corruption. It should only be
    invoked during safe initialization phases when no dungeon instances are active.
