  method: IsRunning
  signature: bool AsyncBotInitializer::IsRunning() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the asynchronous bot initializer is currently running its
    initialization process.
  description: The IsRunning method determines if the AsyncBotInitializer object is
    actively performing initialization tasks. This method is typically used to prevent
    duplicate initialization attempts or to monitor the status of background initialization
    operations. The return value indicates whether the initializer has started but
    not yet completed its initialization sequence. This check is important in multi-threaded
    environments where initialization might occur asynchronously, ensuring that other
    components do not interfere with ongoing setup processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AsyncBotInitializer is currently executing its initialization
    process; otherwise returns false if the initialization has not started or has
    already completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Status Check
    code: "if (asyncBotInitializer.IsRunning()) {\n    // Initialization is in progress\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Bot initializer is currently running\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Initialization has finished or not started\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"\
      Bot initializer is not running\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Concurrent Initialization
    code: "void StartBotInitialization() {\n    if (!asyncBotInitializer.IsRunning())\
      \ {\n        asyncBotInitializer.Start();\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Starting\
      \ bot initialization process\");\n    } else {\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"\
      Initialization already in progress, skipping start\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It provides
    a simple boolean check that does not involve heavy computation or blocking operations.
    The implementation likely uses atomic flags or similar synchronization primitives
    to ensure consistent results across concurrent access.
