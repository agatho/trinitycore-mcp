documentation:
  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the Outlaw Rogue class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs, debuffs, and aura effects that apply to an Outlaw Rogue character.
    This method typically iterates through the rogue's active auras, checks their
    duration and stacking rules, applies any necessary stat modifications or special
    effects, and ensures that the character's visual state and combat capabilities
    are accurately reflected in the game world. It is commonly called during combat
    updates, tick intervals, or when new buffs are applied to maintain proper gameplay
    balance and character performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    rogue->UpdateBuffs();\n    // Other combat\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Buff Update Trigger
    code: "void OnPlayerSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    if (spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id\
      \ == 13750) // Stealth\n        rogue->UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure proper
    buff state management. It may trigger visual effects or stat recalculations, so
    frequent calls could impact performance if not optimized. The implementation likely
    involves checking aura durations and applying or removing effects based on game
    rules.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs outside of appropriate combat contexts might cause
    unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that the method is only invoked
    when the rogue's state is valid for buff evaluation to prevent inconsistent character
    states.
