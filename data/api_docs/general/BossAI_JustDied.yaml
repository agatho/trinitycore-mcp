documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a boss creature dies, triggering necessary cleanup
    and reward distribution.
  description: The JustDied method is a virtual callback function in the BossAI class
    that is invoked when a boss creature's health reaches zero and it is about to
    be destroyed. This method typically handles post-victory actions such as awarding
    loot, updating quest objectives, notifying other NPCs or players, and performing
    any necessary AI state transitions. It serves as a central point for managing
    the consequences of a boss's defeat within the game world. The method does not
    take any parameters and is automatically called by the core game engine upon death.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Death Handling
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI {\npublic:\n    void JustDied() override\
      \ {\n        // Award loot\n        me->SummonGameObject(GO_TREASURE_CHEST,\
      \ position, orientation, 1000);\n        // Notify nearby players\n        DoCast(SPELL_VICTORY_AURA);\n\
      \        // Clear any ongoing events\n        instance->SetData(DATA_BOSS_DEFEATED,\
      \ 1);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be overridden in derived boss AI classes to implement
    custom behavior upon death. It is important to ensure that all necessary cleanup
    and event notifications are handled within this function to prevent orphaned objects
    or incomplete quest progress.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from user code; it is intended for internal
    engine use only. Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it may block
    the game loop during creature destruction.
