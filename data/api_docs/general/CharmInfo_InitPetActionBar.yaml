documentation:
  brief: Initializes the pet's action bar with default spell entries.
  description: The InitPetActionBar method sets up the initial state of a pet's action
    bar by populating it with default spells and abilities. This method is typically
    called during pet creation or when a pet is summoned to ensure that the pet has
    a functional action bar with basic combat abilities. It initializes the action
    bar slots with appropriate spell data based on the pet's type and level, ensuring
    that the pet can perform essential actions such as attacking, defending, and using
    special abilities. The method does not require any parameters and performs its
    initialization directly on the CharmInfo object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing a Pet's Action Bar
    code: "CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();\nif (charmInfo)\n{\n   \
      \ charmInfo->InitPetActionBar();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core when a pet is created
    or summoned, but may also be called manually in custom scripts or modifications.
    It should only be called after the pet's basic properties (such as type and level)
    are properly initialized to ensure correct spell assignment.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method multiple times on the same CharmInfo object
    without proper cleanup, as it might lead to duplicate entries in the action bar.
    Ensure that the pet is fully initialized before invoking this method to prevent
    unexpected behavior or crashes.
