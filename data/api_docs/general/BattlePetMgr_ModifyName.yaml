  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: ModifyName
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::ModifyName(int guid, const int & name, int declinedName)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the name of a battle pet with the specified GUID.
  description: The ModifyName method is used to change the name of a battle pet within
    the BattlePetMgr system. This function takes a unique identifier (GUID) for the
    pet, along with a new name value and an optional declined name parameter. The
    method updates the pet's name in the database or internal storage structure. It
    is typically invoked when players rename their battle pets through in-game interfaces
    or commands. The operation modifies the pet's data directly without requiring
    a full reload of the pet's state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet whose name is to be
      modified. This value must correspond to an existing battle pet in the system.
  - name: name
    description: The new name to assign to the battle pet. This parameter is passed
      as a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying, and should represent a valid
      string identifier for the pet's name.
  - name: declinedName
    description: An optional integer value representing the declined form of the pet's
      name (e.g., for grammatical cases). If not needed, this can be set to zero or
      left unspecified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Rename a Battle Pet
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetMgr();

      int petGuid = 12345;

      const int newName = 67890;

      int declinedForm = 0;

      mgr->ModifyName(petGuid, newName, declinedForm);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid battle
    pet and that the name value is properly formatted. It does not perform validation
    on whether the new name is allowed or unique; such checks should be performed
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior or
    database corruption. Ensure all inputs are validated prior to calling this method,
    especially when dealing with user-provided data.
