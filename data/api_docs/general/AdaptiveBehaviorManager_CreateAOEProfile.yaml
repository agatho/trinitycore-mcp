  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CreateAOEProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new AOE (Area of Effect) behavior profile for adaptive
    AI.
  description: The CreateAOEProfile method is responsible for setting up a new Area
    of Effect behavior profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile defines
    how an AI-controlled unit should behave when targeting multiple enemies within
    a specified radius, including decision-making processes for target selection,
    spell casting priorities, and movement patterns in AOE scenarios. The method typically
    initializes internal data structures and configuration parameters necessary for
    executing AOE-based combat behaviors. It is commonly invoked during AI initialization
    or when switching between different combat strategies. This method does not require
    any input parameters and modifies the internal state of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    to include the new AOE profile.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Initialization
    code: "void MyAI::OnInitialize()\n{\n    m_adaptiveManager->CreateAOEProfile();\n\
      \    // Profile is now ready for use in AOE combat scenarios\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per AI instance to avoid duplicate
    profile creation. The created AOE profile will be automatically managed by the
    AdaptiveBehaviorManager and used during combat when appropriate conditions are
    met.
