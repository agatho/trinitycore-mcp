  signature: void Unit::ReplaceAllUnitFlags(UnitFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all unit flags on the unit with the specified flags.
  description: This method replaces all existing unit flags on a Unit object with
    the provided flags. It is typically used to set or reset the unit's flag state,
    which affects various gameplay mechanics such as movement, combat, and interaction
    states. The method ensures that only the specified flags are active, removing
    any previous flags that may have been set. This operation is commonly used in
    scenarios where a unit needs to be reset to a specific state, such as during combat
    initialization or when applying new status effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->ReplaceAllUnitFlags(UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_PVP);

      // This sets the unit to only have PvP flag active'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the internal flags state of the Unit object.
    It should be used carefully as it may affect gameplay behavior, especially in
    combat situations where flags determine movement and interaction capabilities.
  warnings: This method does not preserve previous flags; it completely replaces all
    existing flags with the new ones provided. Care must be taken to ensure that appropriate
    flags are set, particularly when dealing with complex flag combinations or during
    combat scenarios.
