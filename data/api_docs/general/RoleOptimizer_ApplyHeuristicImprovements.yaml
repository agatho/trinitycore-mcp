  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: ApplyHeuristicImprovements
  signature: void RoleOptimizer::ApplyHeuristicImprovements(int & assignments, const
    int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes player role assignments using heuristic algorithms to improve group
    performance in World of Warcraft instances.
  description: The ApplyHeuristicImprovements method applies various optimization
    techniques to determine the most effective role distribution among players in
    a group. This method is typically used during instance creation or group reorganization
    to ensure optimal performance based on player capabilities, gear, and class composition.
    It analyzes player data including specialization, equipment stats, and role preferences
    to compute improved assignments that enhance overall group success rates. The
    optimization process considers factors such as damage dealer distribution, tank
    allocation, and healer positioning to maximize efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: Reference to an integer representing current player role assignments
      that will be modified by the heuristic improvements
  - name: players
    description: Reference to an integer indicating total number of players in the
      group for which role assignments are being optimized
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Optimization Usage
    code: 'int currentAssignments = 0;

      int playerCount = 5;

      RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.ApplyHeuristicImprovements(currentAssignments, playerCount);

      // currentAssignments now contains optimized role distribution'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management System
    code: "void UpdateGroupRoles(Group* group)\n{\n    int assignments = GetGroupRoleAssignments(group);\n\
      \    int playerCount = group->GetMembersCount();\n    RoleOptimizer optimizer;\n\
      \    optimizer.ApplyHeuristicImprovements(assignments, playerCount);\n    SetGroupRoleAssignments(group,\
      \ assignments);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's advanced group management system and
    should be called after initial role assignment but before instance entry. The
    optimization algorithm considers multiple factors including class-specific roles,
    player gear levels, and historical performance data to determine improved assignments.
  warnings: The method modifies the assignments parameter in-place, so ensure that
    current role assignments are properly backed up if needed. This method should
    not be called during active combat or while players are in instance content as
    it may disrupt ongoing group activities.
