  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: DoAction
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::DoAction(int32 param)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specific action based on the provided parameter for the area trigger
    AI.
  description: The DoAction method in AreaTriggerAI is used to handle various actions
    triggered by the area trigger's events or conditions. This method serves as an
    entry point for executing custom logic associated with different action IDs passed
    as parameters. It allows developers to define unique behaviors for area triggers
    such as activating spells, changing states, or triggering other game mechanics
    based on the input parameter. The method is typically called internally by the
    core system when an event occurs that requires the AI to perform a specific task.
  parameters:
  - name: param
    description: An integer value representing the action ID to be executed. This
      parameter determines which specific behavior or logic path will be taken within
      the AI implementation. Valid values are defined by the specific area trigger's
      script and can represent different actions like activating a spell, starting
      a sequence, or changing the trigger's state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DoAction with a spell activation
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyAreaTriggerAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : AreaTriggerAI(creature) {}\n    \n    void DoAction(int32 param)\
      \ override\n    {\n        switch (param)\n        {\n            case 1:\n\
      \                // Activate spell on player\n                if (Unit* target\
      \ = GetTarget())\n                    me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_TRIGGERED_SPELL,\
      \ true);\n                break;\n            default:\n                break;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is virtual and must be overridden in derived classes to implement
    custom behavior. The parameter value should be carefully managed to avoid unexpected
    behavior or crashes. It's recommended to validate the parameter before processing
    to ensure it falls within expected ranges.
  warnings: Improper handling of the param value can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Make sure all possible action IDs are properly handled in switch/case
    statements to prevent falling through to default cases with unintended consequences.
