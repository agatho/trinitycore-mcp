  class: WorldSession
  method: InvalidateRBACData
  signature: void WorldSession::InvalidateRBACData()
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data for the session, forcing
    a refresh of permissions.
  description: The InvalidateRBACData method clears the cached Role-Based Access Control
    permissions associated with the current WorldSession. This ensures that when the
    next permission check occurs, the system will re-evaluate the player's current
    roles and privileges against the database. This is typically called after role
    or permission changes to ensure that the session reflects the most up-to-date
    access control information. The method does not directly modify any data but invalidates
    the cache to trigger a refresh during the next RBAC check.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating RBAC Data After Role Change
    code: "void Player::OnRoleChanged()\n{\n    // Update database with new role\n\
      \    // ...\n    \n    // Invalidate RBAC data for this session\n    GetSession()->InvalidateRBACData();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with RBAC-related database updates.
    It's important to call this after any permission or role modifications to ensure
    that the player's access rights are properly refreshed. The invalidation does
    not immediately re-fetch data but marks the cache as stale for the next access.
