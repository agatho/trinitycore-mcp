documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the DynamicMapTree class for handling dynamic
    collision detection in the game world.
  description: The DynamicMapTree constructor initializes a new instance of the DynamicMapTree
    class, which is responsible for managing and performing dynamic collision detection
    within the game world. This class is used to handle complex terrain and object
    interactions that change during gameplay, such as moving objects, destructible
    environments, or dynamic obstacles. The constructor sets up internal data structures
    necessary for efficient spatial queries and collision detection operations. It
    prepares the tree structure for use with various collision testing methods and
    ensures proper memory allocation for dynamic elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a DynamicMapTree instance
    code: 'DynamicMapTree* mapTree = new DynamicMapTree();

      // Use the mapTree for collision detection operations

      // ...

      delete mapTree;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The DynamicMapTree class is typically instantiated once per map or area and
    manages a hierarchical spatial partitioning structure. It's designed to handle
    dynamic objects that move or change during gameplay, unlike static collision data.
    The constructor may perform some initial setup work including memory allocation
    for internal nodes and initialization of spatial data structures.
  warnings: This constructor should only be called when the map tree is intended to
    be used for dynamic collision detection. Improper usage or calling this constructor
    without proper context can lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. The class
    assumes that it will be used in a multi-threaded environment where concurrent
    access may occur.
