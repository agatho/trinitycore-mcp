  class: Creature
  method: SetTreatAsRaidUnit
  signature: void Creature::SetTreatAsRaidUnit(bool treatAsRaidUnit)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should be treated as a raid unit for group management
    purposes.
  description: This method controls whether a creature is considered part of the raid
    group for the purpose of loot distribution and other raid-related mechanics. When
    set to true, the creature will be treated as a raid unit, meaning it can participate
    in raid loot rules and other raid-specific behaviors. When set to false, the creature
    will not be treated as a raid unit and will follow normal group behavior. This
    is particularly useful for managing non-player creatures that should behave differently
    in raid contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: treatAsRaidUnit
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should be treated
      as a raid unit. True means the creature will be treated as part of the raid
      group, false means it will not.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example

      creature->SetTreatAsRaidUnit(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n\
      {\n    creature->SetTreatAsRaidUnit(true);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects how the creature interacts with raid group mechanics,
    including loot distribution rules. It should be used carefully as it may impact
    gameplay balance and group dynamics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause creatures to behave unexpectedly
    in raid scenarios, potentially affecting loot distribution or group composition.
