  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GetBotRadius
  signature: float ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GetBotRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the radius of the bot used for obstacle avoidance calculations.
  description: The GetBotRadius method returns the floating-point value representing
    the radius of the bot character in the game world. This radius is crucial for
    obstacle avoidance algorithms, as it determines how close the bot can safely approach
    other objects or entities without colliding. The returned value typically corresponds
    to the bot's collision radius and is used internally by the AI system to calculate
    safe paths around obstacles. This method is read-only and does not modify any
    internal state of the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the radius of the bot in game units. This value
    is typically positive and defines the collision boundary of the bot for pathfinding
    and avoidance calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float botRadius = obstacleAvoidanceManager.GetBotRadius();

      // Use botRadius to adjust AI behavior or debug pathfinding

      std::cout << "Bot radius: " << botRadius << " units" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pathfinding
    code: "float currentRadius = obstacleAvoidanceManager.GetBotRadius();\nfloat safetyMargin\
      \ = currentRadius * 1.2f;\n// Use the calculated margin for path planning\n\
      if (distanceToObstacle < safetyMargin) {\n    // Initiate avoidance behavior\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned radius value is usually precomputed and cached during bot initialization.
    This method should be called frequently during AI updates, but due to its simplicity,
    it has minimal performance impact. The value may vary depending on the bot's type
    or model size in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObstacleAvoidanceManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized manager could lead to
    undefined behavior. Also, be aware that the radius returned might not reflect
    real-time changes to the bot's physical dimensions during runtime.
