  class: LFGMgr
  method: RemovePlayerData
  signature: void LFGMgr::RemovePlayerData(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all LFG (Looking for Group) data associated with a specific player
    GUID from the manager.
  description: The RemovePlayerData method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all Looking for Group (LFG) related data that has been stored for a particular
    player identified by their global unique identifier (GUID). This typically occurs
    when a player leaves the LFG system, logs out, or is removed from a group. The
    method ensures that no stale or outdated LFG information persists in memory, which
    helps maintain the integrity of the LFG subsystem and prevents potential issues
    such as duplicate entries or incorrect matchmaking behavior. It's an essential
    part of the LFG manager's lifecycle management for individual players.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG data
      should be removed. This value is typically obtained from the player object and
      uniquely identifies them within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already obtained

      lfgMgr->RemovePlayerData(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Data During Player Logout
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    sLFGMgr->RemovePlayerData(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Other logout logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the LFG system when a player's
    session ends or their group state changes. It may also be invoked during server
    maintenance or cleanup operations to ensure all LFG data is properly cleared from
    memory.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID could lead to
    undefined behavior or memory access violations. Ensure that the provided GUID
    corresponds to a valid player before calling this function.
