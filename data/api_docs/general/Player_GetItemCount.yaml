api:
  class: Player
  method: GetItemCount
  signature: uint32 Player::GetItemCount(uint32 item, bool inBankAlso, Item * skipItem)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of a specific item in the player's inventory and
    bank.
  description: The GetItemCount method retrieves the total quantity of a specified
    item that exists in both the player's inventory and bank. It accounts for all
    stacks of the item, including those in bags, equipped items, and bank slots. This
    method is commonly used for quest progression, item tracking, and inventory management
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The method considers all possible
    locations where an item might be stored, making it useful for determining item
    availability or quantity for various game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: The item ID to count. This parameter specifies which item type to
      look for in the player's inventory and bank.
  - name: inBankAlso
    description: When set to true, includes items in the bank (including bank bags).
      When false, only counts items in the inventory.
  - name: skipItem
    description: Optional parameter that allows skipping a specific item instance
      during counting. This is useful when counting items while excluding a particular
      item from consideration.
  returns: Returns the total count of the specified item across all inventory locations,
    including bank if inBankAlso is true. Zero indicates no items found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 itemCount = player->GetItemCount(12345); // Counts all instances
      of item ID 12345 in inventory and bank
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 itemCount = player->GetItemCount(12345, true, nullptr); // Counts
      all instances of item ID 12345 including bank items

      uint32 itemCount = player->GetItemCount(12345, false, item); // Counts only
      inventory items, skipping a specific item instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance and may be used in various game
    mechanics such as quest completion or item tracking. It does not account for temporary
    enchantments or effects that might modify item counts.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the skipItem parameter, as it can lead to incorrect
    counts if not properly handled. Also note that this method does not consider items
    in temporary containers like temporary enchantment slots.
