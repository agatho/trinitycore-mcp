  class: InteractionValidator
  method: RecordValidation
  signature: void InteractionValidator::RecordValidation(InteractionType type, bool
    passed) const
documentation:
  brief: Records the validation result of an interaction type.
  description: The RecordValidation method logs whether a specific interaction type
    passed or failed its validation check. This method is typically used within the
    TrinityCore framework to track and monitor player interactions, such as quest
    completions, item usage, or NPC dialogues, ensuring that these interactions adhere
    to game rules and preventing exploits. The method does not return any value but
    updates internal tracking structures based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of interaction being validated. This parameter specifies
      which category of interaction (e.g., quest, item, NPC) is being recorded.
  - name: passed
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the validation check passed (true)
      or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a successful quest interaction
    code: 'InteractionValidator validator;

      validator.RecordValidation(InteractionType::QUEST_COMPLETE, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a failed item usage interaction
    code: 'InteractionValidator validator;

      validator.RecordValidation(InteractionType::ITEM_USE, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger validation system and may be used
    in conjunction with other methods to maintain game integrity. It's important to
    ensure that all interaction types are properly defined and handled to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
