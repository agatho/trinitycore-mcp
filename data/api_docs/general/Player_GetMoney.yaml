  method: GetMoney
  signature: uint64 Player::GetMoney() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total amount of money a player currently has in copper coins.
  description: The GetMoney method retrieves the player's current money amount, which
    is stored in copper units (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold). This value
    represents the player's total currency inventory and can be modified through various
    game mechanics such as quest rewards, loot drops, or NPC interactions. The method
    is commonly used in scripts and game systems to determine player's financial status
    for transactions, purchases, or reward distributions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the total amount of copper coins the
    player has, with values ranging from 0 to 2^64-1 (approximately 18 quintillion
    copper).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 money = player->GetMoney();\nif (money > 1000)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ has more than 10 gold\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison Example
    code: "uint64 money = player->GetMoney();\nuint64 gold = money / 10000;\n// Convert\
      \ to gold\nif (gold >= 10)\n{\n    // Player has at least 10 gold\n    // Can\
      \ afford expensive items\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    value returned represents the player's current money state, which may change during
    gameplay due to various game events. Implementation details include internal storage
    of money in copper units rather than gold units directly.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the total money amount, not just the
    money in the player's inventory but also any money stored in bank or other locations.
    Also note that this value can be modified by other methods like AddMoney or SetMoney,
    so it may not reflect the actual current state if those methods are used.
