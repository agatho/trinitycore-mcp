  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::HandlePopulationImbalance(uint32 zoneId, int32
    difference)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts bot population in a specified zone to balance against a given difference.
  description: The HandlePopulationImbalance method is responsible for managing the
    number of bots in a specific game zone to maintain a desired population balance.
    It takes a zone identifier and a difference value that indicates how many bots
    should be added or removed from that zone. This method is typically invoked by
    the bot lifecycle management system when automatic balancing is required, such
    as during server load adjustments or when maintaining specific player-to-bot ratios
    in certain areas. The implementation likely involves creating or destroying bot
    instances based on the calculated difference.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier for the game zone where population adjustment is
      needed. This value corresponds to a defined area in the game world, such as
      a battleground, instance, or regular zone.
  - name: difference
    description: Signed integer indicating the desired change in bot population. Positive
      values indicate bots should be added; negative values indicate bots should be
      removed. Zero means no change is required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Balance Bot Population in a Battleground
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->HandlePopulationImbalance(1234, 5); // Add
      5 bots to zone 1234
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce Bot Population Due to Overpopulation
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->HandlePopulationImbalance(5678, -3); // Remove
      3 bots from zone 5678
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated bot lifecycle management system and
    should only be called by internal systems. It may trigger additional events or
    updates to maintain consistency across the game world. The method does not directly
    interact with player characters but affects the AI-controlled bot entities.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent bot population counts,
    which may affect gameplay balance and server performance. Ensure that zone IDs
    are valid and that the difference values are within expected ranges to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
