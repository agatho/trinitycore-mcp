  method: IsValidTarget
  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsValidTarget(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given unit is a valid target for the scanner's targeting
    logic.
  description: The IsValidTarget method evaluates whether a specified Unit object
    meets the criteria to be considered a valid target within the context of the TargetScanner.
    This typically involves checking factors such as the target's faction, health
    status, visibility, and other combat-related conditions. The method is commonly
    used in AI behavior trees or spell targeting systems to filter out invalid or
    unwanted targets before proceeding with actions like casting spells or initiating
    attacks. It ensures that only appropriate units are considered during target selection
    processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided Unit is a valid target according to the scanner's
    internal rules; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (scanner.IsValidTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with attack or\
      \ spell casting\n    caster->CastSpell(targetUnit, SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Valid Targets in a Loop
    code: "for (auto& unit : unitsInRange) {\n    if (scanner.IsValidTarget(unit))\
      \ {\n        validTargets.push_back(unit);\n    }\n}\n// Use validTargets for\
      \ further processing"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks on unit state, such as whether the unit is
    dead, invisible, or in a non-targetable state. It's designed to be efficient and
    should not cause performance bottlenecks when used in tight loops or frequent
    calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling it, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, note that this method does not validate the target's current combat
    state or line-of-sight; additional checks may be required depending on use case.
