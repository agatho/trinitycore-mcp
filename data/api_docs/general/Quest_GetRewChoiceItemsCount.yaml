    choices for a given quest. It is used to determine how many item options are available
    for players to select from when completing a quest. The method is typically called

  notes: This method is part of the quest system and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to properly handle quest rewards. The value returned
    may vary depending on the specific quest and its reward structure.

    choice items are defined for a quest, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about reward availability.
