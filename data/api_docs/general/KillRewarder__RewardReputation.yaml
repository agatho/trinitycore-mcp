  class: KillRewarder
  method: _RewardReputation
  signature: void KillRewarder::_RewardReputation(Player * player, float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards reputation to a player based on kill-related criteria and rate multiplier.
  description: The _RewardReputation method is responsible for granting reputation
    points to a Player object when certain kill-based conditions are met. This function
    typically operates within the context of mob kills or quest completion events
    where players earn reputation with specific factions. The rate parameter allows
    for scaling of the reputation gain, which can be influenced by factors such as
    difficulty levels, player level differences, or game balance settings. The method
    likely integrates with TrinityCore's faction and reputation systems to ensure
    proper tracking and application of reputation changes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the reputation reward.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointer results in undefined behavior.
  - name: rate
    description: Float value representing the multiplier applied to the base reputation
      gain. Values typically range from 0.0f (no reward) to 2.0f or higher for bonus
      rewards. Should be positive and finite.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Reward
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player instance

      float rewardRate = 1.0f;

      killRewarder->_RewardReputation(targetPlayer, rewardRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Bonus Reputation for High-Level Player
    code: 'Player* highLevelPlayer = ...; // Player with higher level

      float bonusRate = 1.5f;

      killRewarder->_RewardReputation(highLevelPlayer, bonusRate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's reputation cache and may trigger
    updates to faction standing UI elements. It should only be called after verifying
    that the kill event qualifies for reputation rewards. The actual reputation gain
    calculation might involve internal lookup tables or configuration values specific
    to the game's balance system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of player state or kill
    eligibility may result in incorrect reputation accumulation or potential exploits.
    Ensure that the 'rate' parameter is properly clamped to prevent excessive reward
    inflation.
