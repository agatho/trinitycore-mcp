documentation:
  brief: Processes instance lock response packets from the client to handle dungeon/raid
    lock status updates.
  description: The HandleInstanceLockResponse method processes incoming instance lock
    status responses from players' clients. This method is part of the WorldSession
    class and handles communication related to instance locking mechanics in World
    of Warcraft, such as when a player enters or exits an instance, or when instance
    locks are acquired or released. It typically receives information about whether
    an instance lock was successfully applied or removed, and updates internal session
    state accordingly. The method plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization
    between client and server regarding instance access permissions and lock states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleInstanceLockResponse(WorldPackets::Instance::InstanceLockResponse&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process instance lock response\n    if (packet.Locked)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle locked state\n        sWorld->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"\
      Player locked instance.\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle unlocked\
      \ state\n        sWorld->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"Player unlocked instance.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore packet
    handling system when an InstanceLockResponse packet is received. Developers should
    ensure proper session state management after processing this response, particularly
    regarding player instance access permissions and synchronization with the database.
