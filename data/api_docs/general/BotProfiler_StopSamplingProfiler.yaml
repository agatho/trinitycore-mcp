  signature: void BotProfiler::StopSamplingProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the sampling profiler for bot performance analysis.
  description: The StopSamplingProfiler method terminates an ongoing sampling profiler
    session that was started by a previous call to StartSamplingProfiler. This method
    is used in TrinityCore's bot framework to halt performance monitoring and finalize
    profiling data collection. The profiler typically records CPU usage, memory allocation
    patterns, and execution time of various bot behaviors during the sampling period.
    Once stopped, the collected data can be analyzed or exported for debugging and
    optimization purposes. This method should only be called after a corresponding
    StartSamplingProfiler call has been made.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartSamplingProfiler();

      // ... bot operations ...

      profiler.StopSamplingProfiler();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with StartSamplingProfiler to
    enable performance monitoring of AI behaviors. The profiler data collected may
    include function call frequencies, execution times, and resource consumption metrics
    that help developers optimize bot performance.
