  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute3v3TankDPSHealer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 3v3 tank, DPS, and healer AI behavior for arena combat.
  description: The Execute3v3TankDPSHealer method implements the artificial intelligence
    logic specific to 3v3 arena matches, determining how a player should behave in
    terms of tanking, dealing damage, or providing healing support. This method is
    part of the ArenaAI class and manages the strategic decision-making process during
    arena combat. It evaluates the current state of the battle, player role assignment,
    and enemy positioning to execute appropriate actions for optimal team performance.
    The method is typically invoked during arena match execution and modifies player
    behavior based on predefined arena tactics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter determines which specific player's AI
      logic will be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "void MyArenaAI::Update()\n{\n    int playerIndex = 0;\n    Execute3v3TankDPSHealer(&playerIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed specifically for 3v3 arena matches and assumes proper
    initialization of the ArenaAI context. It relies on internal state tracking and
    player role assignments to function correctly. The method may modify player behavior
    directly through game mechanics such as spell casting, movement, or targeting.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without correct arena setup can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect AI decisions. Ensure that the ArenaAI context is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
