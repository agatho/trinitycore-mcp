  signature: MailDraft & MailDraft::AddMoney(uint64 money)
documentation:
  brief: Adds gold money to the mail draft for the recipient to claim.
  description: The AddMoney method adds a specified amount of gold to the mail draft.
    This allows developers to attach monetary rewards or costs to mails sent through
    the TrinityCore system. The money is added to the mail's monetary value and will
    be available for the recipient to claim when they open the mail. This method supports
    up to 2^64-1 gold pieces, which aligns with the maximum uint64 value. The method
    returns a reference to the MailDraft object, enabling method chaining.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the current MailDraft object, allowing for method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MailDraft draft("Congratulations!", "You have been awarded.");

      draft.AddMoney(100000); // Adds 100 gold to the mail

      // Send the mail using a function like SendMailTo()

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "MailDraft draft(\"Reward\", \"Here is your reward.\")\n    .AddMoney(50000)\n\
      \    .AddItem(12345, 2) // Add item and money in sequence\n    .SendMailTo(player);\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal monetary value of the mail draft. It does
    not validate whether the amount is within reasonable game limits or if the player
    has sufficient funds to cover the cost, as that would be handled during mail sending.
    The money added here will appear in the mail's 'money' field when claimed by the
    recipient.
  warnings: Ensure that the gold amount being added is valid and within expected game
    mechanics. Adding extremely large values may cause issues with client display
    or server processing if not handled carefully.
