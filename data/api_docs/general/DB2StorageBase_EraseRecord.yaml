  class: DB2StorageBase
  method: EraseRecord
  signature: void DB2StorageBase::EraseRecord(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a record with the specified ID from the DB2 storage container.
  description: The EraseRecord method removes a record identified by its unique ID
    from the DB2 storage container. This operation is typically used during runtime
    when dynamic modifications to game data are required, such as updating or removing
    entries in creature templates, item prototypes, or other database-backed structures.
    The method ensures that the internal data structure remains consistent after removal
    and may trigger invalidation of cached references. It's important to note that
    this method does not validate whether the ID exists before attempting removal,
    which could lead to undefined behavior if called with an invalid ID.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the record to be removed from the storage
      container. This value must correspond to a valid entry in the DB2 file or the
      method may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a creature template record
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* creatureStorage = sDB2Manager->GetCreatureStorage();

      creatureStorage->EraseRecord(12345);

      // The creature template with ID 12345 is now removed from the storage.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional record removal
    code: "DB2StorageBase* itemStorage = sDB2Manager->GetItemStorage();\nuint32 itemId\
      \ = 98765;\nif (itemStorage->HasRecord(itemId)) {\n    itemStorage->EraseRecord(itemId);\n\
      \    // Item record successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    record. It performs direct removal without checking for dependencies or references,
    so care must be taken when using it in systems where records might be referenced
    elsewhere. The underlying storage mechanism may use hash maps or similar structures,
    making this operation generally O(1) on average.
  warnings: Calling EraseRecord with an invalid ID can result in undefined behavior
    or corruption of internal data structures. Always ensure that the ID exists before
    calling this method. Additionally, removing records during active gameplay or
    while other systems are accessing them may lead to race conditions or crashes
    if not properly synchronized.
