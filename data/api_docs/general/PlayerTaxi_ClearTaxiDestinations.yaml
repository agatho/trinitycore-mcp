documentation:
  brief: Clears all taxi destinations from the player's taxi path.
  description: The ClearTaxiDestinations method removes all pending taxi route waypoints
    from a player's current taxi path. This function is typically invoked when a player
    interrupts or cancels their taxi travel, or when resetting their taxi route state.
    The method ensures that any queued taxi destinations are cleared and the player's
    taxi path is reset to an empty state. This operation directly affects the player's
    movement behavior and prevents further automatic taxi travel along previously
    planned routes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Taxi Destinations on Player Interrupt
    code: "void OnPlayerInterruptTaxi(Player* player)\n{\n    player->GetTaxi().ClearTaxiDestinations();\n\
      \    player->SendTaxiPath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal taxi path state of a PlayerTaxi
    object. It should be called carefully during travel interruptions or route resets
    to maintain proper game state consistency.
