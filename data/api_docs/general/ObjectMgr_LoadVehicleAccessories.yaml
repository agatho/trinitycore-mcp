documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes vehicle accessory data from the database into memory
    for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadVehicleAccessories method is responsible for retrieving all
    vehicle accessory configurations stored in the database and loading them into
    memory. This includes data about which creatures serve as accessories (such as
    passengers or mounts) for specific vehicle entries. The method typically runs
    during server startup or reload operations to ensure that vehicle behavior and
    passenger interactions are properly initialized. It processes the data to build
    internal lookup structures that allow the game engine to quickly determine which
    creatures can act as accessories for a given vehicle type. This functionality
    is crucial for proper vehicle mechanics in World of Warcraft, enabling features
    like mounted creatures, vehicle passengers, and related gameplay interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadVehicleAccessories();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reloads. It performs database queries to fetch vehicle accessory data and builds
    internal caches for fast lookup. The method assumes that the database tables containing
    vehicle accessory information are properly populated with valid data.
  warnings: Improperly configured vehicle accessory entries in the database can lead
    to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when vehicles are spawned. Ensure all
    referenced creature and vehicle IDs exist in their respective tables before calling
    this method.
