  method: ReceiveEmote
  signature: void PetAI::ReceiveEmote(int * player, int textEmote)
documentation:
  brief: Handles emote interactions from players for the pet AI.
  description: The ReceiveEmote method in PetAI is responsible for processing emotes
    sent by players to a pet. This method is typically invoked when a player performs
    an emote action near a pet, allowing the pet's AI to respond appropriately based
    on the emote type and context. It integrates with the game's emote system to enable
    interactive behavior between players and their summoned creatures or companions.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal AI state or triggers
    specific actions depending on the emote received.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID)
      who performed the emote.
  - name: textEmote
    description: An integer value indicating the type of emote being performed, typically
      corresponding to predefined emote IDs in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emote Handling Example
    code: "void HandlePlayerEmote(PetAI* petAI, Player* player, uint32 emoteId) {\n\
      \    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n    petAI->ReceiveEmote(&playerId,\
      \ emoteId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI behavior system for pets in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the pet and player are within interaction range and that the emote
    is valid for the pet's AI state. The implementation may vary depending on whether
    the pet is a summoned creature, a companion, or a guardian.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID and emote ID are properly validated before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. Improper handling
    of emotes can lead to inconsistent AI responses or denial-of-service conditions
    in extreme cases.
