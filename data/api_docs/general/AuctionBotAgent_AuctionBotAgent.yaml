  brief: Moves an AuctionBotAgent instance to a new location using move semantics.
  description: The AuctionBotAgent constructor that accepts an rvalue reference to
    another AuctionBotAgent object. This move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from the source object to the newly constructed object, effectively relocating
    the agent. The operation is typically used in scenarios where an AuctionBotAgent
    needs to be repositioned or reassigned without copying its internal state. In
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this method supports
    efficient resource management for auction bot agents that may need to be relocated
    between different auction houses or systems. This constructor ensures no unnecessary
    copying occurs during agent movement operations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an AuctionBotAgent
    code: 'AuctionBotAgent agent1;

      // ... perform some operations ...

      AuctionBotAgent agent2 = std::move(agent1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, which means it should only be called with rvalue
    expressions. Using it with lvalues will result in a compilation error or unexpected
    behavior. The move operation transfers all internal resources from the source
    object to the new one, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the moved-from object after this constructor is
    called unless explicitly documented otherwise. The source object becomes invalid
    after the move and should not be used for further operations.
