  class: Creature
  method: SetRespawnTime
  signature: void Creature::SetRespawnTime(uint32 respawn)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the respawn time for a creature, determining when it will reappear after
    being killed.
  description: The SetRespawnTime method configures the respawn timer for a creature
    instance, controlling how long the creature remains dead before respawning. This
    is crucial for managing game mechanics like loot drops, quest completion, and
    NPC availability. The method accepts a uint32 parameter representing the respawn
    time in seconds, which can be set to zero to disable respawn entirely or to a
    specific value to control timing. When a creature's respawn time is set, it affects
    the creature's behavior in the world, including its appearance and interaction
    with players.
  parameters:
  - name: respawn
    description: The respawn time in seconds. A value of 0 disables respawn, while
      any positive value sets a specific respawn duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting respawn time to 30 seconds
    code: Creature->SetRespawnTime(30);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling respawn for a creature
    code: Creature->SetRespawnTime(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature management
    functions and should be called during creature initialization or when modifying
    game state. The respawn time directly affects the creature's behavior in the world,
    including its appearance and interaction with players.
  warnings: Setting respawn time to zero will prevent the creature from respawning,
    which may cause issues if the creature is needed for quest completion or other
    game mechanics. Always ensure that the respawn time is set appropriately for the
    intended game context.
