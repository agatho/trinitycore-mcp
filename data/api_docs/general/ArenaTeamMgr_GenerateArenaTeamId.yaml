  class: ArenaTeamMgr
  method: GenerateArenaTeamId
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeamMgr::GenerateArenaTeamId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for a new arena team within the realm.
  description: The GenerateArenaTeamId method is responsible for creating and returning
    a unique 32-bit unsigned integer identifier that will be assigned to a newly created
    arena team. This identifier ensures that each arena team in the game has a distinct
    ID, which is essential for tracking team statistics, managing roster changes,
    and maintaining data integrity across the server's arena team system. The method
    typically increments an internal counter or retrieves the next available ID from
    a database sequence to ensure uniqueness. It is commonly called when a new arena
    team is formed through player interaction, such as creating a 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5
    team.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier assigned to the newly
    created arena team. This ID is guaranteed to be unique within the realm and can
    be used to reference the specific arena team in other operations.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new arena team with generated ID
    code: 'uint32 newTeamId = sArenaTeamMgr->GenerateArenaTeamId();

      ArenaTeam* newTeam = new ArenaTeam();

      newTeam->SetId(newTeamId);

      newTeam->SetName("MyAwesomeTeam");

      sArenaTeamMgr->AddArenaTeam(newTeam);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe as it's expected to be called during
    arena team creation, which usually occurs in a single-threaded context. However,
    if used concurrently in multi-threaded environments, developers should ensure
    proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to prevent race conditions.
