  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: ShouldPlaceTrap
  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ShouldPlaceTrap() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the marksmanship hunter should place a trap based on current
    combat state and resource availability.
  description: This method evaluates various conditions to decide if the marksmanship
    hunter should deploy a trap during combat. It considers factors such as available
    focus, enemy proximity, trap cooldowns, and tactical positioning. The decision-making
    process is integral to the hunter's AI behavior and ensures optimal use of trap
    abilities in different combat scenarios. This method is typically called during
    the hunter's AI update cycle to determine the next action in the combat routine.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should place a trap, false otherwise. The decision
    is based on current game state including focus levels, enemy distance, and cooldown
    status of trap abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->ShouldPlaceTrap()) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ TRAP_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom hunter AI logic
    code: "class MyHunterAI : public PlayerAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (ShouldPlaceTrap()) {\n            // Logic to\
      \ place trap\n            PlaceTrap();\n        }\n        // Other AI logic...\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the marksmanship hunter's specialized AI behavior
    and should only be called when the hunter is in combat. The implementation may
    vary based on the specific hunter specialization and current gear configuration.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it may return unexpected
    results due to uninitialized state variables. Ensure that the hunter has sufficient
    focus before attempting to place a trap.
