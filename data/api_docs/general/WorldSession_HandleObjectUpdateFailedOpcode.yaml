  signature: void WorldSession::HandleObjectUpdateFailedOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::ObjectUpdateFailed
    & objectUpdateFailed)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the object update failed opcode received from a client, processing
    the failure and logging relevant information.
  description: The HandleObjectUpdateFailedOpcode method processes an incoming ObjectUpdateFailed
    packet from a WorldClient. This opcode is typically sent when the client fails
    to properly update or receive updates for a game object, such as a unit, item,
    or dynamic object. The method logs the failure and may perform cleanup or recovery
    actions depending on the specific object type and context. It's part of TrinityCore's
    network packet handling system and is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    between the server and client states. This method does not require any special
    preconditions but assumes a valid WorldSession and proper packet parsing.
  parameters:
  - name: objectUpdateFailed
    description: The parsed ObjectUpdateFailed packet containing information about
      which object failed to update, including its type, GUID, and reason for failure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleObjectUpdateFailedOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::ObjectUpdateFailed\
      \ & objectUpdateFailed)\n{\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"Client\
      \ failed to update object with GUID: %u, Type: %u\", \n                   objectUpdateFailed.ObjectGUID.GetCounter(),\
      \ objectUpdateFailed.ObjectType);\n    // Additional logic for handling failed\
      \ updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core network I/O handling and should not be called
    directly. It's invoked automatically by the packet dispatcher when an ObjectUpdateFailed
    opcode is received. The method may be extended in future versions to include more
    sophisticated recovery mechanisms or logging.
  warnings: Improper handling of object update failures can lead to client desynchronization,
    ghost objects, or disconnects. Ensure that all object references are validated
    before processing this failure message.
