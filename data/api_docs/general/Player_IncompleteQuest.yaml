documentation:
  brief: Marks a quest as incomplete, preventing it from being completed.
  description: This method sets the specified quest as incomplete in the player's
    quest log, ensuring that the quest cannot be turned in or completed. It is typically
    used when a quest needs to remain in progress for gameplay reasons, such as when
    a player is unable to complete the quest due to missing items or objectives. The
    method does not remove the quest from the player's quest log entirely but rather
    marks it as incomplete, which affects how the game handles quest completion and
    progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->IncompleteQuest(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest progression mechanics
    and may be called when a quest cannot be completed due to missing requirements
    or items. It does not affect the quest's progress or status in the player's quest
    log, but rather prevents completion.
  warnings: Using this method incorrectly can lead to quests remaining stuck in an
    incomplete state, preventing players from progressing through content. Care should
    be taken when using this method to ensure that it is only used when necessary.
