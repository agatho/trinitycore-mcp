  class: EscortAI

  signature: bool EscortAI::IsEscorted() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the NPC is currently being escorted by a player.
  description: The IsEscorted method determines whether the current NPC instance is
    currently under the escort of a player character. This method is typically used
    within the EscortAI system to verify the state of an escorted unit. When an NPC
    is escorted, it means that a player has initiated an escort quest or event where
    the NPC follows the player. The method returns true if the NPC is actively being
    escorted and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for managing quest
    progression and NPC behavior during escort sequences in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the NPC is currently being escorted by a player, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check escort status
    code: "if (escortAI->IsEscorted())\n{\n    // NPC is being escorted\n    // Perform\
      \ escort-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEscorted in a quest event handler
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        if (escortAI && !escortAI->IsEscorted())\n     \
      \   {\n            // Start escort\n            escortAI->Start(false, true,\
      \ player->GetGUID());\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the EscortAI class.
    It's important to note that the return value may change during the execution of
    an escort sequence as the escort state can be modified by various events such
    as player disconnection, quest completion, or NPC death.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only reflects the current escort state and does
    not account for future escort events. If you're checking this value in a loop
    or during frequent updates, ensure that your logic properly handles transitions
    between escorted and non-escorted states to prevent unexpected behavior.
