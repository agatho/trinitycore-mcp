  method: IsSpawnGroupActive
  signature: bool Map::IsSpawnGroupActive(uint32 groupId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a spawn group is active within the map.
  description: This method determines if a specific spawn group, identified by its
    unique group ID, is currently active in the map. It evaluates the spawn group's
    status based on various conditions including whether it has been activated, deactivated,
    or is currently in use. The method is essential for managing dynamic spawns and
    ensuring proper game mechanics behavior during world events or instance encounters.
    This functionality is particularly important for handling dynamic spawn groups
    that may be enabled/disabled based on player activity or game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spawn group with the specified groupId is currently
    active, false otherwise. The method returns false when the spawn group has been
    deactivated or does not exist in the current map context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool isActive = map->IsSpawnGroupActive(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in conditional logic
    code: "if (map->IsSpawnGroupActive(12345)) {\n    // Spawn group is active, proceed\
      \ with spawn logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Spawn group is inactive, handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map spawn group tracking mechanisms. It may
    be affected by performance considerations when checking large numbers of spawn
    groups. The method should be used carefully in loops to avoid excessive overhead.
  warnings: This method does not validate the existence of the groupId parameter;
    it simply checks if the group is active, which means that calling with a non-existent
    group ID will return false without error. Care should be taken when using this
    method in conjunction with other spawn-related methods.
