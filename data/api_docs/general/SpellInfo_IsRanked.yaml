  class: SpellInfo
  method: IsRanked
  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsRanked() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is a ranked spell, returning true if the spell
    has ranks and false otherwise.
  description: The IsRanked method checks if a spell in the SpellInfo class has multiple
    ranks available. This is typically used for spells that can be upgraded through
    talent points or skill progression, such as those found in the player's spellbook.
    The method returns true when the spell is part of a chain or sequence of spells
    where each subsequent rank is more powerful than the previous one, and false when
    the spell is a single, unranked spell. This functionality is essential for determining
    spell progression and handling spell upgrades during character advancement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has ranks available (i.e., it's part of a spell
    chain), false otherwise. This indicates that the spell can be upgraded through
    skill or talent points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsRanked()) {\n    // Handle ranked spell logic\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Handle unranked spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine spell progression and handling. The implementation relies on internal
    spell data structures that may vary depending on the specific spell being checked.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with checking if a spell is a learned
    spell or a spell that can be cast; it specifically checks for rank availability.
    Misusing this method could lead to incorrect spell progression handling.
