documentation:
  brief: Enters an area trigger for the unit
  description: This method allows a Unit (such as a player or creature) to enter an
    area trigger, which is typically used for triggering quest events, spell effects,
    or other game mechanics that require area-based interactions. The method handles
    the necessary internal logic to activate the area trigger and may involve checking
    conditions, triggering events, or updating the unit's state. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with area trigger scripts or quest-related code.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTrigger
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the area trigger ID. This value
      typically corresponds to a specific area trigger defined in the game database,
      and may be used to determine which event or effect should be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      int areaTriggerID = 1234;

      unit->EnterAreaTrigger(&areaTriggerID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may require the unit to be in a valid state (e.g., not dead or
    in combat) before entering an area trigger. Performance considerations include
    potential delays if the area trigger involves complex logic or multiple events.
    This method is thread-safe when used properly, but should be called from within
    appropriate context.
  warnings: This method may cause unexpected behavior if the area trigger ID is invalid
    or not properly configured in the database. It's important to ensure that the
    unit is in a valid state before calling this method, as calling it while dead
    or in combat can lead to undefined behavior.
