  method: AddContext
  signature: void AIDecisionTimer::AddContext(const std::string & additionalContext)
documentation:
  brief: Adds additional context information to an AI decision timer for use in AI
    behavior logic.
  description: The AddContext method allows adding supplementary contextual data to
    an AIDecisionTimer instance. This contextual information can be used by AI systems
    to make more informed decisions during gameplay. The method accepts a string parameter
    that represents additional context, which may include environmental factors, recent
    events, or state information relevant to the AI's decision-making process. This
    functionality is particularly useful in TrinityCore's AI framework where dynamic
    context influences NPC behavior and decision trees. The added context is typically
    used internally by the AI system to determine appropriate actions based on current
    game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: additionalContext
    description: A string containing additional contextual information to be added
      to the AI decision timer. This can represent various game state details, environmental
      conditions, or event data that influences AI behavior decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding combat context to AI decision timer
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer;

      timer.AddContext("enemy_in_range:1");

      timer.AddContext("health_percentage:75");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding environmental context for NPC behavior
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer patrolTimer;

      patrolTimer.AddContext("time_of_day:night");

      patrolTimer.AddContext("weather_conditions:rain");

      patrolTimer.AddContext("nearby_players:3");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI decision-making systems
    within TrinityCore. The context data is stored internally and may be accessed
    by various AI components during decision evaluation. Ensure that the context strings
    are concise and meaningful for optimal AI performance.
  warnings: Be cautious when adding large amounts of context data, as this could impact
    performance. Context strings should be kept reasonably sized to avoid memory overhead
    or processing delays in AI decision cycles.
