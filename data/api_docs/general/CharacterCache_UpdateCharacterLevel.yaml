  class: CharacterCache
  method: UpdateCharacterLevel
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterLevel(const int & guid, uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the level of a character in the cache using the provided GUID and
    level values.
  description: The UpdateCharacterLevel method is responsible for updating the cached
    level information for a specific character identified by their globally unique
    identifier (GUID). This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to maintain consistency between the database and in-memory character data. It
    ensures that any changes to a character's level are reflected in the local cache,
    which can improve performance by reducing database queries. The method accepts
    a constant reference to the GUID and a uint8 value representing the new level.
    This operation is generally performed during character progression events such
    as leveling up or when loading character data from the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: A constant reference to the globally unique identifier of the character
      whose level needs to be updated. This value uniquely identifies the character
      within the game world and is typically obtained from the database or character
      creation process.
  - name: level
    description: An 8-bit unsigned integer representing the new level value for the
      character. Valid values are typically between 1 and 255, though the exact range
      may depend on game mechanics and expansion support.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::Instance();

      int characterGuid = 12345;

      uint8 newLevel = 60;

      cache->UpdateCharacterLevel(characterGuid, newLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Level Progression Event
    code: "void OnPlayerLevelUp(Player* player)\n{\n    CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::Instance();\n\
      \    cache->UpdateCharacterLevel(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), player->getLevel());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the in-memory cache and does not directly modify
    the database. Changes made using this method will only persist until the server
    restarts or until a subsequent database sync occurs. The character GUID should
    be validated before calling this method to prevent errors. This method is thread-safe
    if used with proper synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an existing character in
    the cache, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. Avoid calling this method
    with invalid level values (e.g., zero or negative numbers) as it may cause inconsistencies
    in game mechanics. The method does not perform any validation on the level value
    itself beyond type checking.
