  method: GeneratePath
  signature: void TransportMgr::GeneratePath(const GameObjectTemplate * goInfo, TransportTemplate
    * transport)
documentation:
  brief: Generates and populates a transport path for a GameObject based on its template
    information.
  description: The GeneratePath method is responsible for constructing the movement
    path that a transport object (such as a ship or elevator) will follow. It processes
    the GameObject's template data to determine waypoints, speeds, and timing for
    the transport's movement. This method is typically invoked during transport initialization
    or when loading transport data from the database. The generated path is used by
    the transport system to calculate positions at any given time during the transport's
    operation.
  parameters:
  - name: goInfo
    description: Pointer to the GameObjectTemplate structure containing the template
      information for the transport object. This includes data such as waypoints,
      movement speeds, and other transport-specific properties.
  - name: transport
    description: Pointer to the TransportTemplate structure that will be populated
      with the generated path data. This structure holds the actual path information
      used during runtime for transport movement calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Transport Initialization
    code: "void InitializeTransport(GameObjectTemplate* goInfo, TransportTemplate*\
      \ transport)\n{\n    TransportMgr::instance()->GeneratePath(goInfo, transport);\n\
      \    // Path is now ready for use in transport movement calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the TransportTemplate in-place and should only be called
    during initialization or when path data needs to be regenerated. The method assumes
    that the GameObjectTemplate contains valid waypoint data and will not perform
    validation on the input parameters.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized GameObjectTemplate or
    TransportTemplate pointers may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    all template data is properly loaded before invoking this method.
