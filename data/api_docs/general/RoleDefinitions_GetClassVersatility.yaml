documentation:
  brief: Returns the versatility coefficient for a specified class in the World of
    Warcraft game system.
  description: The GetClassVersatility method retrieves the versatility rating multiplier
    specific to a given player class. This value is used in various combat calculations
    to determine how much additional damage or healing a class can deal based on their
    versatility stat. The method likely accesses internal class data tables or configuration
    settings within TrinityCore's framework to return the appropriate float value
    representing the versatility coefficient for the specified class ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the versatility coefficient for the
    specified class. This value typically ranges between 0.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 represents
    base versatility and values above or below indicate increased/decreased effectiveness
    of versatility effects.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Versatility for Warrior Class
    code: 'float warriorVersatility = RoleDefinitions::GetClassVersatility(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns the versatility coefficient for warriors, typically around 1.05-1.10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class configuration data that may be
    loaded at server startup or dynamically during runtime. The exact implementation
    details depend on how TrinityCore stores and manages class-specific statistics.
  warnings: Ensure the classId parameter is valid (0-11 for standard WoW classes)
    to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect return values. Invalid class IDs may
    result in unexpected or zero-based return values.
