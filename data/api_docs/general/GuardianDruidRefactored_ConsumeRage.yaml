  class: GuardianDruidRefactored
  method: ConsumeRage
  signature: void GuardianDruidRefactored::ConsumeRage(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of rage from the Guardian Druid's rage resource.
  description: The ConsumeRage method reduces the current rage value of the Guardian
    Druid by the specified amount. This method is typically used during ability execution
    or passive effects that require rage consumption. The method ensures that rage
    does not drop below zero, and may trigger rage-related events or state changes
    depending on implementation details within the TrinityCore framework. It is commonly
    called when abilities such as Mangle or Swipe are executed, which consume rage
    to maintain gameplay balance and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of rage points to be consumed from the Guardian Druid's
      current rage pool. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the rage
      cost of an ability or effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rage Consumption
    code: "void ApplyMangleAbility()\n{\n    // Consume 10 rage points for executing\
      \ Mangle\n    guardianDruid->ConsumeRage(10);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Rage Consumption
    code: "void ExecuteSwipeAttack()\n{\n    if (guardianDruid->GetRage() >= 20)\n\
      \    {\n        guardianDruid->ConsumeRage(20);\n        // Perform swipe attack\
      \ logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the Guardian Druid has sufficient
    rage to avoid negative values. The implementation may include checks to ensure
    rage never goes below zero, and could potentially trigger rage-related callbacks
    or UI updates in the client.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current rage will
    result in undefined behavior or potential resource corruption if not handled properly
    by the caller. Ensure proper validation before invoking this method.
