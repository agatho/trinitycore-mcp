  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: OptimizeWithEvolution
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::OptimizeWithEvolution(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes performance for a specific bot using evolutionary algorithms based
    on its GUID.
  description: The OptimizeWithEvolution method applies evolutionary optimization
    techniques to enhance the performance of a specified bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method utilizes genetic algorithm principles to iteratively improve
    the bot's behavior, decision-making processes, and resource allocation strategies.
    It operates on a per-bot basis identified by its unique Game Object ID (GUID),
    making it suitable for optimizing individual AI entities rather than global systems.
    The optimization process may involve adjusting parameters such as movement patterns,
    combat tactics, or quest completion strategies to achieve better performance metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be optimized. This value
      must correspond to a valid GameObject in the world, typically representing an
      AI-controlled NPC or creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.OptimizeWithEvolution(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimization with Error Handling
    code: "PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;\nuint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      if (botGuid != 0)\n{\n    optimizer.OptimizeWithEvolution(botGuid);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid GUID case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid bot GUID provided\
      \ for optimization.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called asynchronously or during idle periods
    to avoid performance degradation. The evolutionary process may take multiple iterations
    to converge on optimal solutions, and results are typically cached for subsequent
    calls. Implementation details include population management, fitness evaluation
    functions, and crossover/mutation operators tailored specifically for AI behavior
    tuning.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID will likely
    result in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the bot exists in
    the world before invoking optimization. Additionally, repeated calls to this method
    on the same bot may cause performance overhead due to continuous evolutionary
    adjustments.
