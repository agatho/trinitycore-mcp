  signature: void MetricStatistics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all collected metric statistics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated metric data within the MetricStatistics
    object, restoring it to its default empty state. This operation is typically used
    to prepare the statistics collector for a new measurement period or to discard
    outdated data. The method does not take any parameters and has no return value.
    It is commonly invoked when starting a new performance monitoring session or after
    exporting collected metrics to prevent data duplication in subsequent measurements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Metrics Before New Session
    code: 'MetricStatistics stats;

      // ... collect some metrics ...

      stats.Reset(); // Clear all collected data

      // ... begin new measurement period ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate reset of internal counters and accumulators.
    It's thread-safe if used in a single-threaded context, but concurrent access to
    the same MetricStatistics instance from multiple threads should be synchronized
    by the caller.
