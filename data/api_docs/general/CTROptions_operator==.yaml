  class: CTROptions
  method: operator==
  signature: bool CTROptions::operator==(const CTROptions & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two CTROptions objects for equality and returns true if they are
    identical.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    CTROptions object and another CTROptions object passed as a parameter. It evaluates
    whether all corresponding members of both objects have the same values, determining
    if the two instances represent the same configuration or settings. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to ensure that two options structures
    are functionally equivalent before performing operations that depend on identical
    configurations. The comparison typically involves checking flags, settings, and
    other configurable parameters within the CTROptions structure.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The CTROptions object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      must be a valid CTROptions object reference.
  returns: Returns true if all members of both CTROptions objects are equal; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two CTROptions instances
    code: 'CTROptions options1;

      CTROptions options2;

      bool isEqual = (options1 == options2); // Returns true if both objects have
      identical settings'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in conditional logic
    code: "CTROptions currentOptions;\nCTROptions savedOptions;\n\nif (currentOptions\
      \ == savedOptions) {\n    // Configuration has not changed, no need to save\n\
      \    printf(\"Configuration unchanged\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Save new configuration\n\
      \    printf(\"Saving new configuration\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using member-wise comparison of all
    data members. It's important to note that if CTROptions contains pointers or complex
    objects, the comparison may involve deep comparisons depending on how the operator==
    is implemented for those nested types. The method is marked as const, indicating
    it does not modify either object during comparison.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects containing floating-point
    numbers or pointers, as exact equality comparisons might not behave as expected
    due to precision issues or pointer address differences rather than content differences.
