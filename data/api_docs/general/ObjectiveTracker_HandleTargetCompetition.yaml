  method: HandleTargetCompetition
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::HandleTargetCompetition(Player * bot, uint32 targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles competition logic for a target in the objective tracker
  description: The HandleTargetCompetition method processes competition-related events
    or updates for a specified target within the objective tracking system. This method
    is typically invoked when a player's objectives involve competing against other
    players or NPCs, such as in battlegrounds, arenas, or quest scenarios where player
    performance affects objective completion. The method likely updates internal state,
    triggers UI notifications, or modifies objective progress based on competition
    outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      objectives are being tracked and processed for competition events
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity involved in the competition,
      which could be another player, NPC, or objective marker
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateCompetitiveObjectives()\n{\n    if (Player* player =\
      \ GetBot())\n    {\n        uint32 targetGuid = GetTargetGuid();\n        objectiveTracker->HandleTargetCompetition(player,\
      \ targetGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI or quest tracking system and may
    interact with internal objective state machines. It should be called only when
    both the bot player and target are valid and in scope for competition-based objectives.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is not null before calling this
    method, as invalid pointers can cause crashes. Also verify that the targetId corresponds
    to a valid entity in the current world context.
