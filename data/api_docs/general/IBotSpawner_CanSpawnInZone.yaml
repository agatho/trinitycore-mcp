  signature: bool IBotSpawner::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on zone
    restrictions and configuration settings.
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it is permissible to spawn a
    bot within a given zone. This check typically considers various factors such as
    zone type (e.g., battlegrounds, arenas, sanctuaries), player count limits, and
    server-defined restrictions. The method returns true if spawning is allowed, false
    otherwise. It is commonly used during bot initialization or when attempting to
    place bots in specific zones to ensure compliance with game rules and prevent
    exploits. This function does not perform actual spawning but rather validates
    the conditions for spawning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether a bot can be spawned in the specified
    zone. Returns true if spawning is permitted, false if it is not allowed due to
    zone restrictions or configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Bot Can Spawn in Zone
    code: "if (botSpawner->CanSpawnInZone(1234)) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning\
      \ logic\n    botSpawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle restricted zone\
      \ case\n    sLog->outString(\"Cannot spawn bot in zone 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs fast lookups using internal zone data structures
    and should not be called excessively during high-frequency operations. The implementation
    may cache zone restrictions to improve performance.
  warnings: Ensure that zone IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to
    existing zones in the game world, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method
    does not validate zone existence directly; callers should ensure validity before
    calling.
