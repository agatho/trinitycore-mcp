  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: operator=
  signature: CriteriaMgr & CriteriaMgr::operator=(CriteriaMgr && right)
documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of criteria data from one CriteriaMgr instance to another.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a CriteriaMgr
    object, transferring all managed criteria data and resources from the right-hand
    operand to the left-hand operand. This is a move operation, not a copy, meaning
    the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state. The method is typically
    used when assigning one CriteriaMgr instance to another, especially in scenarios
    involving temporary objects or when transferring ownership of criteria-related
    data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's achievement and criterion system,
    this allows efficient transfer of criterion tracking states between different
    managers without unnecessary copying.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the left-hand CriteriaMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Move Assignment of Criteria Managers
    code: 'CriteriaMgr sourceManager;

      // ... populate sourceManager with criteria ...

      CriteriaMgr targetManager = std::move(sourceManager); // Uses operator=

      // sourceManager is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // targetManager contains all the criteria from sourceManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for CriteriaMgr.
    It's designed to be efficient and avoid deep copying of criterion data structures.
    The moved-from object should not be used after this operation unless it's reassigned
    or explicitly reset.
  warnings: After calling operator= with a move operation, the right-hand operand
    is left in a valid but unspecified state. Using it afterward may lead to undefined
    behavior or unexpected results. Ensure that no other code relies on the moved-from
    object's state.
