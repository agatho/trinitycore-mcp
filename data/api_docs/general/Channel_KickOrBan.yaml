  signature: void Channel::KickOrBan(const Player * player, const std::string & badname,
    bool ban)
documentation:
  brief: Kicks or bans a player from the channel based on the provided player name
    and ban flag.
  description: The KickOrBan method removes a specified player from a channel, either
    by kicking them (if ban is false) or banning them (if ban is true). This functionality
    is typically used in game chat systems where administrators or channel moderators
    need to manage disruptive users. The method operates on the channel's internal
    list of members and updates the channel's state accordingly. It requires that
    the calling player has sufficient permissions to perform the action, and it may
    trigger notifications to other channel members about the action taken.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the user attempting to
      kick or ban another player. This player must have appropriate privileges within
      the channel to execute this operation.
  - name: badname
    description: String containing the name of the player to be kicked or banned from
      the channel. This name is used to identify the target user in the channel's
      member list.
  - name: ban
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to ban (true) or simply kick (false)
      the specified player. When true, the player will be prevented from rejoining
      the channel until manually unbanned.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ban a player from a channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->KickOrBan(player, \"DisruptiveUser\", true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Kick a player from a channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->KickOrBan(player, \"Spammer123\", false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling player has sufficient permissions to
    perform the kick or ban action. It does not validate whether the target player
    is actually in the channel before attempting the operation. The implementation
    likely interacts with the channel's internal member list and may send system messages
    to other players in the channel.
  warnings: Using this method with a ban flag set to true will permanently prevent
    the user from rejoining the channel unless manually unbanned by an administrator
    or moderator. Ensure that appropriate checks are performed before calling this
    function to avoid accidental bans.
