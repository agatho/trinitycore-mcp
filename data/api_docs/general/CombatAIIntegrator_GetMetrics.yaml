  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const CombatMetrics & CombatAIIntegrator::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat metrics associated with the CombatAIIntegrator instance.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to the combat-related performance
    and behavioral data tracked by the CombatAIIntegrator. This method returns a constant
    reference to a CombatMetrics object, which encapsulates various statistics such
    as damage dealt, healing done, time spent in combat, and other relevant metrics
    for AI-driven combat analysis. The returned metrics are typically updated during
    combat events and can be used for performance evaluation, logging, or integration
    with external systems that monitor AI behavior. This method does not modify any
    internal state of the CombatAIIntegrator and is safe to call multiple times during
    a combat session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CombatMetrics object containing detailed combat
    statistics and performance data for the AI instance. The reference remains valid
    as long as the CombatAIIntegrator instance exists.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Metrics
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      // ... combat events occur ...

      const CombatMetrics& metrics = aiIntegrator.GetMetrics();

      uint32 totalDamage = metrics.GetTotalDamageDealt();

      uint32 combatTime = metrics.GetCombatTimeInSeconds();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging AI Performance
    code: "void LogAICombatPerformance(CombatAIIntegrator& integrator) {\n    const\
      \ CombatMetrics& metrics = integrator.GetMetrics();\n    std::cout << \"Total\
      \ Damage: \" << metrics.GetTotalDamageDealt() \n              << \", Healing:\
      \ \" << metrics.GetTotalHealingDone()\n              << \", Time in Combat:\
      \ \" << metrics.GetCombatTimeInSeconds() << \"s\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatMetrics reference is valid only while the CombatAIIntegrator
    instance remains alive. If the integrator is destroyed, accessing the returned
    reference results in undefined behavior. The metrics are updated incrementally
    during combat events and may not reflect real-time values if accessed outside
    of active combat scenarios.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the CombatMetrics object through the returned
    reference as it is const. Modifying the underlying data through this reference
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the CombatAIIntegrator instance
    is still valid when accessing the returned metrics.
