  method: ShouldSaveCooldowns
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldSaveCooldowns() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether cooldowns should be saved for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The ShouldSaveCooldowns method checks if the current state of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    requires cooldown information to be persisted. This is typically used during player
    logout or world state transitions to ensure that cooldown timers are accurately
    restored upon reconnection. The method evaluates internal flags and configuration
    settings related to cooldown persistence, returning true when cooldown data should
    be serialized and false otherwise. This functionality supports the seamless continuation
    of player abilities and spell usage across session boundaries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if cooldowns should be saved; false if they should not be
    persisted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    if (AdaptiveBehaviorManager* abm = GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager())\n\
      \    {\n        if (abm->ShouldSaveCooldowns())\n        {\n            // Save\
      \ cooldown data to database\n            SaveCooldowns();\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during session management operations.
    It's recommended to cache the result if the value is used multiple times within
    a single operation to avoid redundant evaluations.
