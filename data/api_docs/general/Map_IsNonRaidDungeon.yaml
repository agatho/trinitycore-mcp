  brief: Determines whether the map is a non-Raid dungeon.
  description: This method checks if the current map instance represents a non-Raid
    dungeon, which includes instances like dungeons, heroic dungeons, and other non-raid
    content. It returns true for maps that are classified as non-Raid dungeons, allowing
    developers to distinguish between raid and non-raid content in World of Warcraft.
    The method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine if player characters
    are entering a non-Raid instance or if they should be subject to specific rules
    and restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a non-Raid dungeon, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the map contains content that is not part of a raid instance, such as regular
    dungeons, heroic dungeons, or other non-raid content.
