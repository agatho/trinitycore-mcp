  class: CastSpellTargetArg
  method: CastSpellTargetArg
  signature: void CastSpellTargetArg::CastSpellTargetArg(SpellCastTargets && targets)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CastSpellTargetArg object with the specified spell cast targets.
  description: The CastSpellTargetArg constructor initializes an instance of the CastSpellTargetArg
    class by taking ownership of SpellCastTargets through a move operation. This method
    sets up the internal state of the target argument structure, which is typically
    used in spell casting mechanics within TrinityCore's core systems. The constructor
    ensures that the provided targets are properly moved into the object, avoiding
    unnecessary copies and improving performance during spell execution. This initialization
    step is crucial for correctly processing spell targets before a spell is cast.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: An rvalue reference to a SpellCastTargets object containing the target
      information for the spell being cast. This includes target GUIDs, positions,
      and other relevant targeting data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.setUnitTarget(player);

      CastSpellTargetArg arg(std::move(targets));'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Multiple Targets
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.addGOTarget(gameobject);

      targets.addUnitTarget(unit);

      CastSpellTargetArg arg(std::move(targets));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a move operation on the SpellCastTargets parameter,
    so the original targets object should not be used after calling this constructor.
    The method assumes that the SpellCastTargets object is in a valid state before
    being moved.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellCastTargets object passed to this constructor is
    properly initialized and contains valid target data. Using an uninitialized or
    invalid targets object may lead to undefined behavior during spell casting.
