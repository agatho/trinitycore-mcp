documentation:
  brief: Sets the extended cost for an item to be used in auction house transactions.
  description: This method assigns a specific extended cost value to an Item object,
    which determines the payment requirements for purchasing or bidding on the item
    through the auction house system. The extended cost typically represents the required
    currency or items needed for the transaction, such as honor points or arena points.
    This functionality is crucial for implementing custom auction house mechanics
    and ensuring proper item pricing within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Setting Extended Cost for Item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetPaidExtendedCost(12345);

      // Sets the extended cost to 12345 for this item'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any auction house operations are performed
    on the item, as it directly affects how the item is processed during bidding and
    purchase transactions. Implementation details include ensuring that the extended
    cost value corresponds to valid game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect auction house behavior
    or invalid item pricing. Care must be taken when setting the extended cost value
    to ensure it aligns with proper game balance and currency systems.
