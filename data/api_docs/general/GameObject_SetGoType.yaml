  class: GameObject
  method: SetGoType
  signature: void GameObject::SetGoType(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the game object type for a GameObject instance.
  description: The SetGoType method assigns a specific type to a GameObject, which
    determines how the game object behaves and interacts with the world. This method
    is used to categorize game objects based on their functional purpose, such as
    doors, buttons, or quest items. The type value influences the object's interaction
    behavior and can affect how players interact with it in-game.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer representing the type of game object. Valid values typically
      correspond to specific game object types like 0 for doors, 1 for buttons, 2
      for quest items, etc. The exact range depends on the implementation and game
      mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetGoType(0); // Set to door type'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      int type = 1;

      go->SetGoType(type);

      // This sets the game object to a button type, affecting its interaction behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used during object initialization or when setting
    up game object properties. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    change the object's visual appearance but rather its functional behavior in the
    game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect interaction behaviors
    with players, potentially causing game mechanics issues or unexpected results
    during gameplay.
