  method: RecordError
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::RecordError(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & errorType, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Records an error event for a specific bot with associated type and contextual
    information.
  description: The RecordError method logs error events occurring within a bot's performance
    analytics system. It captures the unique identifier of the affected bot, the type
    of error that occurred, and additional context about the circumstances surrounding
    the error. This method is typically used to track and analyze issues that may
    affect bot behavior or performance in the World of Warcraft environment. The recorded
    errors are stored for later analysis and reporting purposes, helping developers
    identify patterns and resolve problems in bot functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot instance that encountered
      the error. This value uniquely identifies the specific bot within the TrinityCore
      system.
  - name: errorType
    description: A string describing the type or category of error that occurred.
      Examples might include 'MovementFailure', 'AIPathfindingError', or 'ResourceAllocationFailed'.
  - name: context
    description: A detailed string providing additional context about the error situation,
      such as the location where it occurred, recent actions, or relevant environmental
      factors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Recording
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.RecordError(12345, "MovementFailure", "Failed to navigate to target
      position (x:100, y:200, z:300)");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording AI Pathfinding Error
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string context = "Pathfinding failed between nodes A and B at map ID: 0";

      analytics.RecordError(botGuid, "AIPathfindingError", context);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking. It should not
    interrupt the normal execution flow of bot operations. The actual storage mechanism
    for recorded errors may vary depending on implementation (e.g., in-memory cache,
    database logging, or file output). Developers should ensure that error types and
    contexts are properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters, so it's the caller's responsibility
    to ensure that botGuid is valid and that errorType and context strings are meaningful.
    Repeated calls with identical parameters may lead to performance degradation if
    not handled appropriately in the underlying storage system.
