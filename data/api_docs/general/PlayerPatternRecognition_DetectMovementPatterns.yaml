documentation:
  brief: Analyzes player movement data to detect and classify distinct movement patterns.
  description: The DetectMovementPatterns method processes sampled player movement
    data to identify recurring behavioral patterns such as walking, running, jumping,
    or other locomotion styles. This functionality is typically used in anti-cheat
    systems or game analytics to monitor for abnormal player behavior. The method
    takes a reference to an integer representing the number of samples to analyze
    and returns an integer identifier corresponding to the detected pattern type.
    It operates on internal movement data collected from the player's recent actions
    and requires sufficient sample data for accurate detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value that represents the detected movement pattern
    type. Possible values may include constants like 0 for idle, 1 for walking, 2
    for running, 3 for jumping, etc., though exact values depend on internal implementation
    and configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int pattern = playerPatternRecognition.DetectMovementPatterns(50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Pattern Analysis with Conditional Logic
    code: "int samples = 100;\nint detectedPattern = playerPatternRecognition.DetectMovementPatterns(samples);\n\
      if (detectedPattern == 2) {\n    // Player is running\n    std::cout << \"Detected\
      \ running pattern\" << std::endl;\n} else if (detectedPattern == 3) {\n    //\
      \ Player is jumping\n    std::cout << \"Detected jumping pattern\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player movement tracking data that must be
    sufficiently populated before calling. The accuracy of pattern detection improves
    with a higher number of samples. The implementation may use statistical analysis
    or machine learning techniques to classify movement behaviors.
  warnings: Calling this method without sufficient movement data may result in unreliable
    pattern classification. It is recommended to ensure that the player has performed
    meaningful movement actions prior to invoking this function for accurate results.
