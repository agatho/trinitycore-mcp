  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::UpdateInteractionPhase(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current interaction phase of an NPC for the given time difference.
  description: The UpdateInteractionPhase method is responsible for managing and advancing
    the state of an NPC's interaction with a player. It processes the time delta (diff)
    to determine if any interaction phase transitions should occur, such as moving
    from a greeting to a quest offer or closing the dialog. This method is typically
    called during the game loop to ensure that NPC interactions are properly timed
    and updated in real-time. The method handles internal state management for dialogue
    trees and may trigger associated events or actions based on the current interaction
    phase.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all active NPC interactions\n\
      \    for (auto& npc : m_activeNPCs)\n    {\n        npc->GetInteractionManager()->UpdateInteractionPhase(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked every game tick with the time difference
    since last update. It's important to ensure that this method is called regularly
    to maintain proper interaction timing and avoid stale dialogue states.
