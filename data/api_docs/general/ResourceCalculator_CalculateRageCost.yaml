  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::CalculateRageCost(uint32 spellId, int * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the rage cost for a specified spell based on the caster's properties
  description: The CalculateRageCost method determines the amount of rage required
    to cast a specific spell by evaluating the caster's attributes and the spell's
    defined cost. This method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's
    combat system to enforce resource management for warrior and other rage-based
    classes. It takes into account various factors such as spell properties, caster
    level, and any applicable modifiers or talents that might affect the rage expenditure.
    The method returns a uint32 value representing the calculated rage cost, which
    can then be used to validate whether the caster has sufficient resources before
    executing the spell.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which the rage cost is being
      calculated. This ID must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's level or attribute
      value that influences the rage calculation. The exact meaning depends on how
      the method is implemented internally, but typically refers to the caster's level
      or a modifier value.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the calculated rage cost required to
    cast the specified spell. A return value of zero may indicate no rage cost or
    an error in calculation if the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 rageCost = ResourceCalculator::CalculateRageCost(12345, &casterLevel);\n\
      if (rageCost > 0) {\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int casterLevel = 60;\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\nuint32 rageCost = ResourceCalculator::CalculateRageCost(spellId,\
      \ &casterLevel);\nif (rageCost == 0) {\n    // Handle invalid spell ID or calculation\
      \ error\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid spell ID or calculation failed for spell\
      \ %u\", spellId);\n} else {\n    // Use rageCost to validate player resources\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core resource management system in TrinityCore.
    It may be called frequently during combat simulations, so performance optimization
    is important. The internal implementation likely involves database lookups and
    formula calculations based on spell and caster data.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell entry;
    otherwise, the method might return incorrect or zero values. Also, make sure that
    the caster pointer points to a valid integer value to avoid undefined behavior.
