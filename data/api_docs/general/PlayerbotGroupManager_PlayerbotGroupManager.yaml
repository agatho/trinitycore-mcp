  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerbotGroupManager class
  description: The PlayerbotGroupManager constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for managing player bot groups within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up necessary member variables, registers event handlers,
    and prepares the manager to handle group operations such as adding/removing bots,
    managing group composition, and coordinating bot behavior within player groups.
    The initialization process ensures that the manager is ready to receive and process
    group-related commands from the game engine or external systems.

  - title: Creating a new PlayerbotGroupManager instance
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupManager = new PlayerbotGroupManager();

      // The manager is now initialized and ready to manage player bot groups'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing the player bot system.
    It performs essential setup operations that are required for proper group management
    functionality. The constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource
    allocation that would block the main thread.
