  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::HandleEmergencyDefensives()
documentation:
  brief: Executes emergency defensive abilities for the Brewmaster Monk class during
    combat situations.
  description: The HandleEmergencyDefensives method is responsible for activating
    emergency defensive measures specific to the Brewmaster Monk specialization in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates the current combat
    state and available resources to determine which defensive abilities should be
    prioritized. It typically includes actions such as using defensive cooldowns,
    applying protective auras, or triggering emergency mitigation effects when the
    monk is under significant threat. The method ensures that the Brewmaster Monk
    can respond appropriately to dangerous situations without requiring manual input
    from the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f)\n    {\n        m_brewmasterMonkRefactored.HandleEmergencyDefensives();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations where the
    monk is at risk of taking critical damage. The implementation assumes that the
    character object has valid references to its abilities and resources. It's recommended
    to check for valid target and combat state before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat may result in unintended behavior
    or resource waste. Ensure proper cooldown management as emergency defensives often
    consume significant resources such as brew charges or mana.
