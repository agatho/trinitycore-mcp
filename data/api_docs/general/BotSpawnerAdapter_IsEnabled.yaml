  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot spawner adapter is currently enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method checks the operational state of the BotSpawnerAdapter
    instance to determine if it is currently enabled. This method is typically used
    to verify that the bot spawning functionality is active before attempting to spawn
    or manage bots. The return value indicates whether the adapter has been initialized
    and is ready to process bot spawning requests. This check is important for preventing
    errors when trying to interact with a disabled or uninitialized spawner.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotSpawnerAdapter is enabled and operational, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the adapter has not
    been initialized properly or has been explicitly disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botSpawner->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning operations\n\
      \    botSpawner->SpawnBots();\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled state\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot spawner is not enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Management
    code: "void ManageBots() {\n    if (botSpawner->IsEnabled()) {\n        uint32\
      \ activeBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount();\n        if (activeBots < MAX_BOTS)\
      \ {\n            botSpawner->SpawnNextBot();\n        }\n    } else {\n    \
      \    sLog->outError(\"Cannot manage bots: spawner disabled\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should have minimal performance
    impact. The enabled state may be influenced by configuration settings, server
    startup sequence, or external system conditions. Developers should ensure proper
    initialization of the BotSpawnerAdapter before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly constructed BotSpawnerAdapter
    instance may lead to undefined behavior. Always verify that the adapter object
    is properly constructed before checking its enabled state.
