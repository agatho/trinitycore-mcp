  class: Map
  method: AddCorpse
  signature: void Map::AddCorpse(int * corpse)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a corpse object to the map, registering it for processing and cleanup.
  description: The AddCorpse method is responsible for registering a corpse object
    within the game map's internal data structures. This allows the server to track
    and manage corpse entities, including their position, respawn times, and cleanup
    behavior. The method typically handles the integration of corpse objects into
    the map's corpse management system, ensuring that corpses are properly placed
    in the world and can be interacted with by players or removed according to game
    rules. It is commonly invoked when a player dies and their corpse needs to be
    added to the map for a specified duration before despawning.
  parameters:
  - name: corpse
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the corpse object identifier or
      index within the map's corpse registry. This parameter is expected to point
      to a valid corpse entry that has been initialized and prepared for placement
      on the map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Corpse to the Map
    code: 'int corpseId = 12345;

      Map* map = player->GetMap();

      map->AddCorpse(&corpseId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    dies and their corpse is created. The actual corpse object may be managed separately,
    but this method ensures it's registered with the map for proper tracking. It's
    important to ensure that the corpse pointer passed in points to a valid, initialized
    corpse before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized corpse pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the corpse has been properly created and configured
    before attempting to add it to the map using this method.
