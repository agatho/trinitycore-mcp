documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the startup spawn orchestrator has completed its initialization
    process.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the StartupSpawnOrchestrator
    class has finished setting up all necessary components and data required for managing
    initial creature and game object spawns during server startup. This method is
    typically used to ensure that spawn operations are only performed after the orchestrator
    is fully ready, preventing race conditions or incomplete setups. The check involves
    verifying internal flags or state variables that indicate completion of initialization
    routines such as loading spawn data, registering handlers, and preparing spawn
    queues.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the StartupSpawnOrchestrator has completed its initialization
    process and is ready to manage spawns; otherwise returns false if initialization
    is still in progress or has not yet begun.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check initialization status
    code: "if (startupSpawnOrchestrator.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with spawn\
      \ operations\n    startupSpawnOrchestrator.SpawnAll();\n} else {\n    // Wait\
      \ or defer spawn operation\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Startup spawn orchestrator\
      \ not initialized yet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is generally non-blocking and performs a simple state check.
    It's commonly called during server startup phases to gate further operations until
    the system is ready. The implementation likely relies on atomic flags or mutex-protected
    state variables to ensure thread safety in multi-threaded environments.
