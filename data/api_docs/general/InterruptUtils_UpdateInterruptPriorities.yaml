documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority levels of all active interrupts within the system
  description: The UpdateInterruptPriorities method recalculates and adjusts the priority
    rankings of all currently active interrupt events in the TrinityCore framework.
    This utility function ensures that interrupts are processed according to their
    updated priority values, which may be influenced by various game states such as
    player actions, spell effects, or combat conditions. The method is typically invoked
    during critical system updates or when interrupt configurations change dynamically.
    It operates on internal interrupt queues and modifies their ordering based on
    recalculated priority metrics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    InterruptUtils::UpdateInterruptPriorities();\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may involve iterating through
    all active interrupts and performing priority recalculations. In high-frequency
    scenarios, consider batching updates to avoid performance degradation.
