documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat configuration settings for the enhanced bot AI.
  description: The GetCombatConfig method provides access to the current combat behavior
    configuration used by the EnhancedBotAI instance. This configuration defines how
    the bot should behave during combat situations, including tactics, spell usage,
    target selection, and other AI-driven decisions. The returned reference points
    to an immutable CombatAIConfig object that encapsulates all relevant combat parameters
    for the specific bot instance. This method is typically called internally by the
    AI system or when external systems need to inspect or validate current combat
    settings without modifying them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CombatAIConfig object containing all combat-related
    configuration parameters for this EnhancedBotAI instance. The returned object
    should not be modified as it represents the current active configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Configuration
    code: "const CombatAIConfig& config = botAI->GetCombatConfig();\nif (config.UseSpellRotation)\n\
      {\n    // Bot will use configured spell rotation\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"\
      Bot is using spell rotation\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatAIConfig reference is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime
    of the EnhancedBotAI instance. This method does not perform any expensive operations
    and returns immediately. The configuration object should be treated as read-only
    by external code.
