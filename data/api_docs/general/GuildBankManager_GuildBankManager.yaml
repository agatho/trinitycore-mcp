  signature: void GuildBankManager::GuildBankManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildBankManager instance with default settings and empty
    internal state.
  description: The GuildBankManager constructor initializes the internal data structures
    required for managing guild bank operations. This includes setting up empty containers
    for bank tabs, item storage, and access permissions. The method ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized to their default values before any bank-related
    operations can be performed. It does not perform any database operations or load
    existing guild bank data; this is typically handled separately by other methods
    in the class. The constructor also establishes the foundation for tracking which
    players have access to various bank tabs and items within the guild's bank system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuildBankManager instance
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankManager = new GuildBankManager();

      // The manager is now ready to handle guild bank operations

      // Note: This typically happens internally within the core system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is usually invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when a guild is created or loaded. Developers should not need to manually instantiate
    GuildBankManager objects unless implementing custom guild bank functionality.
    The class relies on proper initialization of the underlying database connection
    and configuration settings for full functionality.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of GuildBankManager should generally be avoided in
    favor of using the framework's built-in guild management system. Manual instantiation
    without proper context may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption if not
    all required dependencies are properly set up.
