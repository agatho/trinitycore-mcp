  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const BotWorldEntryMetrics & BotWorldEntry::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the metrics structure associated with this bot world entry for
    monitoring and analysis purposes.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a constant reference of the
    BotWorldEntryMetrics object that contains various statistical and performance-related
    data points for the bot world entry. This metrics structure typically includes
    information such as active bot counts, memory usage, processing times, and other
    diagnostic data used for system monitoring, performance tuning, and administrative
    oversight within the TrinityCore framework. The returned reference is immutable,
    ensuring that external code cannot modify the internal state of the metrics through
    this accessor. This method is commonly invoked by administrative tools, monitoring
    systems, or debug utilities to gather real-time data about bot behavior and resource
    consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the BotWorldEntryMetrics object associated with
    this bot world entry. The reference remains valid for the lifetime of the BotWorldEntry
    instance and provides read-only access to all collected metrics data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Bot Metrics for Logging
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = ...; // Assume entry is initialized\nconst BotWorldEntryMetrics&\
      \ metrics = entry->GetMetrics();\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"bot.system\", \"Active bots:\
      \ %u, Memory usage: %u KB\",\n            metrics.activeBots, metrics.memoryUsageKB);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Performance Over Time
    code: "void MonitorBotEntry(BotWorldEntry* entry) {\n    const BotWorldEntryMetrics&\
      \ metrics = entry->GetMetrics();\n    if (metrics.processingTimeMs > 1000) {\n\
      \        TC_LOG_WARN(\"bot.system\", \"High processing time detected: %u ms\"\
      ,\n                    metrics.processingTimeMs);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BotWorldEntryMetrics reference is guaranteed to be valid only
    during the lifetime of the BotWorldEntry object. The metrics data may be updated
    asynchronously by background processes, so repeated calls to GetMetrics() might
    return different values over time. This method is lightweight and does not perform
    any expensive operations.
  warnings: While the returned reference is const, it's important to note that the
    underlying metrics structure itself may be modified by internal TrinityCore systems.
    Therefore, if you need to store or cache metric data for later use, consider copying
    the data rather than holding onto the reference.
