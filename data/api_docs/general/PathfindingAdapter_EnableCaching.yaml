  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: EnableCaching
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::EnableCaching(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables pathfinding caching for the adapter instance.
  description: The EnableCaching method controls whether the PathfindingAdapter should
    cache computed paths to improve performance. When enabled, the adapter will store
    previously calculated paths in memory and reuse them when possible, reducing redundant
    computations. This is particularly useful in scenarios with frequent path requests
    for similar destinations. The caching mechanism helps optimize CPU usage and can
    significantly improve response times for pathfinding operations in high-traffic
    areas or during intensive AI behavior calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      pathfinding caching. When true, caching is activated; when false, caching is
      deactivated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable caching for a pathfinding adapter
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.EnableCaching(true);

      // Pathfinding operations will now cache results'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable caching to force fresh calculations
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.EnableCaching(false);

      // All pathfinding requests will compute new paths without using cached data'
    language: cpp
  notes: Caching is automatically managed by the adapter and does not require manual
    cleanup. Enabling caching may increase memory usage, especially in environments
    with many unique paths. The cache size and eviction policies are typically handled
    internally by the pathfinding system.
  warnings: Disabling caching can lead to performance degradation in scenarios with
    repeated path requests. Be cautious when disabling caching during high-frequency
    pathfinding operations as it may cause increased CPU load and slower response
    times.
