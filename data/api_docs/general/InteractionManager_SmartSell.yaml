  class: InteractionManager
  method: SmartSell
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SmartSell(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Sells items from the bot's inventory based on smart criteria such as item
    quality, value, and usefulness.
  description: The SmartSell method evaluates the player's inventory and sells items
    that meet predefined conditions to optimize the bot's gold accumulation. It typically
    filters out useful or rare items while selling common or low-value items. The
    method ensures that essential items like food, water, and quest-related objects
    are not sold unless explicitly overridden. This function is commonly used in automated
    bot scripts for managing inventory efficiently during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one item was successfully sold, false otherwise.
    If no items qualify for selling or an error occurs during the process, it returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SmartSell
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nbool result = sInteractionManager->SmartSell(bot);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Items sold successfully.\");\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"No items were sold.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal logic to determine which items are considered
    'worth selling'. The exact criteria may vary depending on the bot's configuration
    or settings. It is recommended to call this function periodically during bot operation
    to maintain an optimized inventory.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    SmartSell, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also,
    be cautious when using this method in automated scripts since it modifies the
    player's inventory directly.
