  method: Shutdown
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the advanced behavior manager, cleaning up all active behaviors
    and releasing associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the AdvancedBehaviorManager's operation
    by gracefully shutting down all currently active behaviors and releasing any allocated
    resources. This method ensures that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur
    during the shutdown process. It is typically called when the server is stopping
    or when the behavior manager needs to be reset for a new session. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple
    cleanup function. This operation is essential for maintaining stable server performance
    and preventing resource exhaustion in long-running instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = sObjectMgr->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the behavior manager is no longer
    needed. It's recommended to call this before server shutdown or when switching
    between different behavior configurations to prevent memory leaks and ensure clean
    state transitions.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on a behavior manager that is already shut down may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper state checking before invoking this method
    to avoid potential crashes or resource corruption.
