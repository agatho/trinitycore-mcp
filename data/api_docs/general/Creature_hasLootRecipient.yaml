  signature: bool Creature::hasLootRecipient() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature has a loot recipient assigned.
  description: This method checks if a creature has been assigned a loot recipient,
    which typically occurs when a player or group has looted the creature's corpse.
    The method returns true if the creature has a valid loot recipient assigned, indicating
    that loot has been claimed by a specific player or group. This is commonly used
    in loot management systems to prevent duplicate loot claims and ensure proper
    distribution of items from creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has a loot recipient assigned, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature's loot has been claimed by a specific
    player or group.
  examples:
  - title: Check Loot Recipient
    code: "if (creature->hasLootRecipient()) {\n    // Creature has loot recipient\n\
      \    // Do something with loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    to manage creature loot distribution. It's important to note that this method
    does not check if the creature has loot available, only that it has been claimed
    by a recipient.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments as
    it may not be thread-safe. The method may return false positives or negatives
    if the creature's loot recipient state changes during execution.
