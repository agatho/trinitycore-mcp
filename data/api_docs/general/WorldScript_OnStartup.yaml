  brief: Executes initialization code when the world server starts up
  description: The OnStartup method is a callback function that gets invoked during
    the World of Warcraft server startup process. This method is part of the WorldScript
    class and allows developers to execute custom initialization logic when the server
    begins running. It's called once at server boot time, before any world updates
    or player connections are processed. The method provides an opportunity to set
    up global systems, load configuration data, initialize custom modules, or perform
    any other necessary pre-run operations that should occur only once during the
    server lifecycle.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic WorldScript OnStartup Implementation
    code: "class MyWorldScript : public WorldScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnStartup()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Initialize custom system\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Custom system initialized\");\n        // Load configuration data\n        LoadCustomConfig();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called only once during server startup, making it ideal for
    one-time initialization tasks. It runs in the main server thread and should avoid
    long-running operations that could delay server startup. The method executes before
    any world updates or player connections are handled.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy I/O operations or blocking calls in this method
    as they can significantly delay server startup. Do not attempt to access player
    data or world state within this callback, as the server is still initializing.
