documentation:
  brief: Applies the Wild Growth spell effect to a group of targets
  description: The HandleWildGrowth method executes the Wild Growth ability for Restoration
    Druid class, which heals multiple targets within a specified area over time. This
    method processes the healing application to the designated group of players or
    creatures, taking into account the Druid's current mana, spell power, and target
    eligibility. The spell typically affects the caster and nearby allies, distributing
    healing across the group with diminishing returns for each additional target.
    It requires proper targeting and resource management to be effective in both PvE
    and PvP scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which set of targets to apply the
      Wild Growth effect to. Valid values are typically integer identifiers representing
      different group configurations or target sets within the Druid's spell targeting
      system.
  returns: Returns true if the Wild Growth spell was successfully applied to the specified
    group, false otherwise. The method may return false due to insufficient mana,
    invalid target selection, or other spell restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleWildGrowth
    code: "if (druid->HandleWildGrowth(1)) {\n    // Wild Growth successfully applied\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Wild Growth activated!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HandleWildGrowth with group validation
    code: "int targetGroup = GetPlayerGroup();\nif (targetGroup >= 0 && druid->HandleWildGrowth(targetGroup))\
      \ {\n    // Apply healing to the player's current group\n    LOG_INFO(\"druid\"\
      , \"Wild Growth applied to group {}\", targetGroup);\n} else {\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      Cannot cast Wild Growth at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the Druid's current spell power and mana resources.
    The healing distribution follows a diminishing returns formula where each additional
    target receives less healing than the previous one. The group parameter should
    be validated before calling to ensure proper targeting.
  warnings: Calling this method without sufficient mana will result in a failed cast
    and potential resource waste. The group identifier must correspond to an actual
    valid group in the game world, otherwise the spell may not apply correctly or
    could cause unexpected behavior.
