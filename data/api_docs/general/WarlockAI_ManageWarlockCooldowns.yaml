documentation:
  brief: Manages cooldowns for warlock abilities during AI execution
  description: The ManageWarlockCooldowns method is responsible for handling the cooldown
    tracking and management of warlock-specific abilities within the AI system. This
    method ensures that warlock spells are properly scheduled and executed according
    to their cooldown timers, preventing spamming of abilities and maintaining game
    balance. It typically checks the current state of the warlock's cooldowns, determines
    which abilities are ready for use, and updates internal tracking mechanisms accordingly.
    The method is called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain proper spell
    timing and resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageWarlockCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually outside of the AI framework. It relies on internal
    cooldown tracking mechanisms and assumes that the warlock's spell data has been
    properly initialized. The method may interact with the creature's current target
    and spell casting state to determine appropriate cooldown management.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI update loop as it
    depends on the AI framework's internal state management. Improper usage can lead
    to incorrect cooldown tracking and potential spell execution issues.
