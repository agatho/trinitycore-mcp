  method: IsInLunarEclipse
  signature: bool BalanceEclipseTracker::IsInLunarEclipse() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in Lunar Eclipse state.
  description: This method checks if the player character is currently affected by
    the Lunar Eclipse buff, which is a special state in the Balance Druid's spell
    rotation. When in Lunar Eclipse, certain spells deal increased damage and have
    different properties compared to normal gameplay. The method returns true only
    when the player has the specific Lunar Eclipse aura applied to their character.
    This check is commonly used within spell processing logic to modify spell behavior
    or damage calculations based on eclipse states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in Lunar Eclipse state, false otherwise.
    The method does not throw exceptions and always returns a boolean value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetBalanceEclipseTracker()->IsInLunarEclipse()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ lunar eclipse specific damage multiplier\n    spellDamage *= 1.2f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Eclipse State Before Casting
    code: "if (!caster->GetBalanceEclipseTracker()->IsInLunarEclipse()) {\n    //\
      \ Cast regular lunar spell\n    caster->CastSpell(target, LUNAR_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle eclipse-specific behavior\n    caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ ECLIPSE_LUNAR_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of eclipse effects. It
    should only be called after the player's eclipse state has been properly initialized
    and updated during combat. The method does not perform any additional checks for
    aura validity beyond checking if the Lunar Eclipse buff is active.
  warnings: Do not assume that this method will return accurate results outside of
    combat or in situations where eclipse states are not actively managed by the game
    engine. Always verify that the player has a valid eclipse tracker instance before
    calling this method to prevent potential crashes.
