documentation:
  brief: Executes emergency defensive abilities for a Blood Death Knight in response
    to high threat or incoming damage.
  description: The HandleEmergencyDefensives method is responsible for activating
    emergency defensive mechanisms specific to the Blood Death Knight class. This
    method typically triggers abilities such as Death Strike, Heart Strike, or other
    defensive cooldowns when the player's health drops below a certain threshold or
    when facing imminent danger. It serves as a core part of the AI logic that determines
    when to use defensive abilities in combat situations. The method evaluates the
    current state of the Death Knight and applies appropriate defensive actions based
    on threat levels, health percentage, and available resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyBloodDKAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player->GetHealth()\
      \ < m_player->GetMaxHealth() * 0.3f)\n    {\n        m_bloodDeathKnight.HandleEmergencyDefensives();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or threat
    evaluation system. It assumes that the Death Knight has access to defensive abilities
    and sufficient resources (rage, runic power) to execute them. The implementation
    may vary based on the specific AI behavior configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently to avoid spamming
    defensive abilities. Consider implementing cooldown checks or state validation
    before invoking this method in high-frequency update scenarios.
