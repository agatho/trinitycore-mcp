documentation:
  brief: Overrides the sparring health percentage for a creature.
  description: This method sets the health percentage used during sparring encounters,
    which is typically employed in PvP scenarios or specific encounter mechanics where
    creatures have custom health values. The override affects how much health the
    creature will have during sparring, potentially altering combat dynamics and difficulty.
    This method is primarily used for adjusting creature behavior in special PvP content
    or when implementing custom sparring mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: healthPct
    description: The percentage of maximum health to override with, ranging from 0
      to 100. Values below 0 or above 100 are invalid and may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->OverrideSparringHealthPct(50);

      // Sets creature''s sparring health to 50% of its maximum health'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal creature state during sparring encounters,
    and should be used carefully in conjunction with other sparring-related methods.
    It may affect combat behavior and AI decisions during PvP scenarios.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior during sparring
    encounters, potentially causing creatures to have incorrect health values or fail
    to properly engage in PvP combat mechanics.
