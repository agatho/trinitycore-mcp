  method: IsPartOfQuestChain
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::IsPartOfQuestChain(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified quest is part of a quest chain within the
    dynamic quest system.
  description: The IsPartOfQuestChain method checks if a given quest ID belongs to
    an active quest chain in the dynamic quest system. This functionality is essential
    for managing quest dependencies, progression tracking, and ensuring proper quest
    flow in World of Warcraft's questing mechanics. The method evaluates whether the
    specified quest has prerequisite or follow-up quests that form a logical chain.
    It returns true if the quest is connected to other quests in the system, indicating
    it's part of a larger quest sequence; otherwise, it returns false. This check
    is typically used during quest acceptance, completion, and status verification
    processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest ID is part of an active quest chain
    within the dynamic quest system, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem->IsPartOfQuestChain(12345)) {\n    // Quest is part\
      \ of a quest chain\n    printf(\"Quest %d is part of a chain\\n\", 12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Quest stands alone\n    printf(\"Quest %d is not part of any\
      \ chain\\n\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (dynamicQuestSystem->IsPartOfQuestChain(questId))\
      \ {\n        // Handle chain-based quest acceptance\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      This quest is part of a larger quest chain.\");\n    } else {\n        // Handle\
      \ standalone quest acceptance\n        player->SendNotification(\"This is a\
      \ standalone quest.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal quest chain data structures maintained by the
    DynamicQuestSystem. Performance is optimized through caching mechanisms, but frequent
    calls may impact performance in high-traffic scenarios. The system tracks quest
    relationships based on quest dependencies defined in the database and quest scripts.
  warnings: This method assumes that quest chain information has been properly initialized
    and loaded into memory. Calling this method before quest data is fully loaded
    may produce incorrect results. Additionally, modifications to quest chains during
    runtime might not be immediately reflected without proper synchronization.
