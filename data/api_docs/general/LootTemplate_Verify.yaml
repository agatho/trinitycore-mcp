  class: LootTemplate
  method: Verify
  signature: void LootTemplate::Verify(const LootStore & store, uint32 Id) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity of a loot template against its associated loot store.
  description: The Verify method performs a consistency check on a LootTemplate object
    to ensure that all entries within the template are valid and properly referenced
    within the provided LootStore. It checks for correct item IDs, proper chance values,
    and ensures that all referenced items exist in the store. This method is typically
    used during server startup or loot template loading to catch configuration errors
    before they cause runtime issues. The verification process helps maintain data
    integrity and prevents potential crashes or unexpected behavior when loot is distributed
    to players.
  parameters:
  - name: store
    description: Reference to the LootStore that contains the valid loot definitions.
      This store is used to validate that all items referenced in this template actually
      exist within the game's loot system.
  - name: Id
    description: The unique identifier for this specific loot template. Used primarily
      for logging and error reporting purposes to identify which template failed verification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Verification Usage
    code: "LootTemplate* lootTemplate = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplate(12345);\nif (lootTemplate)\n\
      {\n    lootTemplate->Verify(*sLootMgr, 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verification in Debug Mode
    code: '#ifdef TRINITY_DEBUG

      LootTemplate* template = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplate(67890);

      template->Verify(*sLootMgr, 67890);

      #endif'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when loot
    templates are loaded from database. It performs checks that may be expensive in
    terms of performance and is usually disabled in release builds. The method does
    not modify any data but will log warnings or errors if inconsistencies are found.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized LootTemplate can lead
    to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure the template and store parameters are
    valid before calling Verify. This method should not be called during active gameplay
    as it may cause performance issues.
