  class: CreatureGroup
  method: MemberEngagingTarget
  signature: void CreatureGroup::MemberEngagingTarget(Creature * member, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Instructs a creature group member to engage a specified target unit.
  description: The MemberEngagingTarget method is used to make a specific creature
    within a CreatureGroup begin engaging a given target unit. This typically occurs
    during AI behavior where a group member needs to initiate combat or follow-up
    on a target. The method likely updates the creature's AI state and sets its current
    target, potentially triggering associated combat behaviors or group coordination
    logic. It is commonly used in scripted creature behaviors or AI-driven group actions
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will engage the target. Must
      be a valid member of the current CreatureGroup.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the creature member will engage.
      Can be any valid Unit (player, creature, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (CreatureGroup*\
      \ group = me->GetCreatureGroup())\n    {\n        group->MemberEngagingTarget(me,\
      \ target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Engaging Target from Group Leader
    code: "void GroupLeaderAI::HandleAttack()\n{\n    if (CreatureGroup* group = GetCreatureGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        for (auto& member : group->GetMembers())\n        {\n      \
      \      if (member && member != me)\n            {\n                group->MemberEngagingTarget(member,\
      \ target);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature is already part of a valid CreatureGroup.
    It does not perform any validation on whether the member belongs to the group
    or if the target is valid for engagement. The actual behavior may depend on how
    the group's AI logic is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'member' and 'target' pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also,
    be cautious when calling this in rapid succession, as it might interfere with
    existing AI state transitions.
