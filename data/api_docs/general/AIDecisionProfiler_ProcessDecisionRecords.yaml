documentation:
  brief: Processes and analyzes AI decision records collected during gameplay to provide
    performance insights.
  description: The ProcessDecisionRecords method is responsible for analyzing and
    evaluating all AI decision records that have been gathered by the AIDecisionProfiler.
    This method typically iterates through stored decision data, calculates relevant
    metrics such as decision latency, success rates, or resource usage, and may generate
    reports or log findings for debugging and optimization purposes. It plays a crucial
    role in understanding how AI behavior performs under various conditions and helps
    developers identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the AI decision-making
    process. The method assumes that decision records have already been collected
    and stored within the profiler's internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      // ... collect AI decisions ...

      profiler.ProcessDecisionRecords(); // Analyze collected records'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after sufficient AI decision data has been
    collected. It may perform intensive processing and could impact performance if
    used too frequently during active gameplay. Consider calling this method during
    idle periods or at specific intervals for optimal results.
  warnings: Calling ProcessDecisionRecords without prior collection of decision records
    may result in undefined behavior or empty analysis results. Ensure that the profiler
    is properly initialized and that decision recording is enabled before invoking
    this method.
