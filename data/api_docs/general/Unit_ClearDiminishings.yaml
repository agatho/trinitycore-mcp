    diminishing returns. It is commonly used in scenarios where a unit needs to be
    reset for gameplay mechanics such as spell cooldowns or debuff durations. The
    method ensures that no further diminishing return effects will apply to the unit's
    actions until the next applicable trigger.

    diminishing return modifiers. It should be used carefully during gameplay events
    to avoid unintended side effects.
