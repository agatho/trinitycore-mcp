  class: CreatureAI
  method: OnSpellStart
  signature: void CreatureAI::OnSpellStart(const int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the start of a spell cast by the creature AI.
  description: The OnSpellStart method is invoked when a creature begins casting a
    spell. This method provides an opportunity for custom AI behavior during the spell
    casting process. It is typically called as part of the creature's AI update cycle
    and allows developers to implement specific actions or modifications when a spell
    starts. The method does not return any value, indicating that it performs side
    effects rather than computations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may represent spell ID, cast
      time, or other spell-related data. The exact meaning depends on the implementation
      context and how the AI system is configured.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnSpellStart(const\
      \ int* spellId) override {\n        // Custom logic when a spell starts\n  \
      \      if (spellId && *spellId == 12345) {\n            // Do something special\
      \ for spell ID 12345\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI interface and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. The parameter passed may vary depending on how the
    spell casting system triggers this event. Ensure that any modifications to creature
    state or behavior within this function do not cause race conditions or performance
    issues.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations inside OnSpellStart
    as it can affect the game's frame rate and responsiveness. Also, be cautious when
    modifying spell-related data structures directly from this callback without proper
    synchronization.
