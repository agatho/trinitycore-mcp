  method: IsMember
  signature: bool ArenaTeam::IsMember(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player with the specified GUID is a member of this arena
    team.
  description: The IsMember method determines if a player identified by their global
    unique identifier (GUID) is currently a member of the arena team. This method
    performs a lookup within the internal roster of the arena team to verify membership
    status. It is commonly used in arena-related game mechanics such as validating
    player participation in matches, checking eligibility for rewards, or managing
    team composition during battleground events. The method does not perform any database
    queries directly but relies on cached data structures representing the current
    team members.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a player with the specified GUID is found in the arena
    team's member list; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Team Membership
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team &&\
      \ team->IsMember(56789)) {\n    // Player with GUID 56789 is a member of arena\
      \ team 12345\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_MEMBER_CHECK, 56789);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsMember in Arena Match Validation
    code: "void ValidateArenaMatch(Player* player, uint32 arenaTeamId) {\n    ArenaTeam*\
      \ team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(arenaTeamId);\n    if (!team || !team->IsMember(player->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        player->SendArenaTeamCommandResult(ERR_ARENA_TEAM_NOT_MEMBER);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with match validation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the arena team's internal data structure is up-to-date
    and reflects the current roster. In a multi-threaded environment, it may be necessary
    to ensure thread safety when accessing arena team data concurrently. The method
    uses an efficient lookup mechanism, typically implemented with a hash map or similar
    structure for O(1) average-case performance.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks membership based on cached data
    and does not account for real-time changes unless the arena team's roster has
    been updated accordingly. If used outside of proper synchronization contexts,
    it may return stale results.
