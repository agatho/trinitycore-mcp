  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsAuraExclusiveBySpecificWith(const SpellInfo * spellInfo)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two spells are mutually exclusive based on their specific
    aura effects.
  description: This method checks if the current spell and the provided spellInfo
    are mutually exclusive due to their specific aura effects. It evaluates whether
    both spells can coexist or if they conflict with each other in terms of aura application.
    The method is commonly used in spell system logic to prevent conflicting spells
    from being applied simultaneously, particularly in scenarios involving player
    abilities, talent trees, or special effects that modify the same game mechanics.
    This function is essential for maintaining proper spell interaction rules and
    preventing game-breaking conflicts between different spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the two spells are mutually exclusive due to their specific
    aura effects; otherwise returns false. The method considers both spells' aura
    types, durations, and other specific properties to determine exclusivity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAuraExclusiveBySpecificWith(otherSpellInfo)) {\n    //\
      \ Handle mutually exclusive spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell interaction
    checks to ensure proper spell stacking and conflict resolution. Performance-wise,
    it involves comparing specific aura properties of two spells, which may require
    careful optimization for large-scale spell processing.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when determining spell conflicts,
    as incorrect implementation can lead to game balance issues or unexpected behavior
    in player abilities. It's important to ensure that the comparison considers all
    relevant aura parameters and not just specific ones.
