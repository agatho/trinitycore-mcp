  signature: bool DB2Manager::HasItemCurrencyCost(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the specified item has a currency cost associated with it
    in the DB2 database.
  description: The HasItemCurrencyCost method determines if a given item ID is linked
    to a currency cost within the TrinityCore database. This functionality is typically
    used to verify if an item can be purchased or acquired using in-game currencies
    such as Honor Points, Arena Points, or other reward currencies. The method performs
    a lookup in the DB2 storage structures that contain item-related currency requirements.
    It returns true if a currency cost entry exists for the specified item ID, and
    false otherwise. This check is commonly used during item purchase validation,
    loot distribution, and quest reward processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified item has a currency cost defined in the DB2
    database; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->HasItemCurrencyCost(12345)) {\n    // Item 12345 has a\
      \ currency cost\n    printf(\"Item has currency cost\\n\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Item 12345 does not have a currency cost\n    printf(\"Item has no currency\
      \ cost\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Item Purchase Logic
    code: "void HandleItemPurchase(Player* player, uint32 itemId) {\n    if (sDB2Manager->HasItemCurrencyCost(itemId))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with currency-based purchase logic\n        // e.g.,\
      \ check if player has enough currency\n        printf(\"Processing currency-based\
      \ item purchase\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Fall back to normal item acquisition\n\
      \        printf(\"Standard item acquisition\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on DB2 data structures which are loaded at server startup.
    The lookup is optimized for performance using internal hash tables or indexed
    structures. Ensure that the DB2 files containing currency cost information are
    properly loaded before calling this method.
  warnings: The method assumes that the item ID provided corresponds to a valid item
    in the game database. Invalid item IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results if not validated beforehand.
