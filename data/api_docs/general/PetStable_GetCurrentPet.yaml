  class: PetStable
  method: GetCurrentPet
  signature: const PetInfo * PetStable::GetCurrentPet() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the currently active pet information stored in the pet
    stable.
  description: The GetCurrentPet method retrieves a constant pointer to the PetInfo
    structure that represents the currently active pet within the pet stable. This
    method is typically used to access details about the player's current summoned
    or controlled pet, such as its GUID, entry ID, level, and other relevant properties.
    The returned pointer is valid only while the pet stable remains in scope and should
    not be modified directly. If no pet is currently active or stored in the stable,
    this method may return a null pointer depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a PetInfo object representing the current pet in
    the stable, or nullptr if no pet is active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const PetInfo* pet = petStable->GetCurrentPet();\nif (pet != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Current pet GUID: \" << pet->guid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Pet Validity
    code: "const PetInfo* currentPet = petStable->GetCurrentPet();\nif (currentPet\
      \ && currentPet->entry > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with pet operations\n    uint32\
      \ petEntry = currentPet->entry;\n    uint32 petLevel = currentPet->level;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to pet information and should not be
    used to modify internal pet data. The returned PetInfo pointer is only valid during
    the lifetime of the PetStable instance and any associated pet data structures.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the contents of the returned PetInfo structure,
    as it's marked as const. Accessing the returned pointer after the PetStable has
    been destroyed or cleared may result in undefined behavior.
