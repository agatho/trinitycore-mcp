documentation:
  brief: Applies active mitigation effects to the Brewmaster Monk's current target.
  description: The HandleActiveMitigation method is responsible for processing and
    applying active mitigation mechanics specific to the Brewmaster Monk class in
    TrinityCore. This method typically handles the logic for reducing incoming damage
    based on abilities such as Fortifying Brew, Guard, or other defensive cooldowns
    that are active during combat. It evaluates the current state of the monk's mitigation
    abilities, applies appropriate damage reduction calculations, and updates the
    target's damage absorption accordingly. The method is usually invoked during damage
    application phases to ensure proper mitigation is accounted for in combat calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler()\n{\n    BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monk = GetPlayerAsBrewmasterMonk();\n\
      \    if (monk)\n        monk->HandleActiveMitigation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the monk is in combat and has active
    mitigation abilities. The implementation assumes that damage reduction calculations
    are already properly initialized and that the target object is valid. Performance-wise,
    this method should execute quickly as it's typically called during critical combat
    phases.
  warnings: Ensure that the monk instance is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer exceptions. This method modifies internal state variables related
    to mitigation, so calling it outside of combat or with invalid targets may lead
    to unexpected behavior.
