documentation:
  brief: Processes idle phase for active quests in the quest manager.
  description: The ProcessIdlePhase method handles the internal logic for managing
    quests that are currently in an idle state. This typically involves checking quest
    progress, updating quest states, and performing any necessary cleanup or state
    transitions for quests that have not been actively engaged by the player. The
    method is usually invoked during periodic updates or when a player's session becomes
    inactive. It ensures that quest data remains consistent with game mechanics and
    player progression.

    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _questManager->ProcessIdlePhase();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player's update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually unless specifically required by custom quest logic.
    It may perform database operations to persist quest state changes.
