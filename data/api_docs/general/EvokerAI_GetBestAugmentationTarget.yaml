  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetBestAugmentationTarget
  signature: int * EvokerAI::GetBestAugmentationTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal target for applying augmentation effects
    based on current combat state and spell priorities.
  description: The GetBestAugmentationTarget method evaluates available targets within
    the Evoker's current threat list or aggro range to identify the most suitable
    candidate for applying augmentation spells. This method considers factors such
    as target health percentage, proximity, threat level, and the evoker's current
    spell rotation strategy. It is typically used during the AI decision-making process
    to prioritize which creature or player should receive an augmentation effect next.
    The returned pointer points to an integer identifier representing the target's
    GUID (Global Unique Identifier), which can be used to retrieve the actual GameObject
    or Unit object from the game world. If no valid target exists, it may return nullptr
    or a special invalid GUID value depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best augmentation
    target. Returns nullptr if no suitable target is found or if the AI state prevents
    targeting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Evoker AI logic
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = evokerAI->GetBestAugmentationTarget()) {\n    Unit*\
      \ target = evokerAI->GetUnit(*targetGuid);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with applying augmentation spell\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(target,\
      \ AUGMENTATION_SPELL_ID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's core AI behavior and should be called
    periodically during combat updates. The target selection logic may vary based
    on the evoker's current specialization or role (e.g., damage dealer vs. healer).
    Ensure that any returned GUID is validated before use to prevent access violations.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer will always point to a valid unit;
    always check for null or invalid values before dereferencing. Improper handling
    of the target GUID could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
