  class: UpdateTimeHistogram
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 UpdateTimeHistogram::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum recorded update time value from the histogram.
  description: The GetMax method returns the highest recorded update time value stored
    within the UpdateTimeHistogram instance. This histogram is typically used to track
    performance metrics for various game systems, such as how long different update
    operations take. The returned value represents the peak duration in milliseconds
    of all recorded updates since the histogram was initialized or last reset. This
    method is useful for performance monitoring and debugging purposes, allowing developers
    to identify bottlenecks in system updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum update time recorded in the histogram,
    measured in milliseconds. Returns 0 if no values have been recorded yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: "UpdateTimeHistogram updateHistogram;\n// ... some operations that populate\
      \ the histogram ...\nuint32 maxTime = updateHistogram.GetMax();\nif (maxTime\
      \ > 1000) {\n    // Log warning: Update took longer than 1 second\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Update operation exceeded 1s: %u ms\", maxTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other histogram methods
    like GetMin(), GetAverage(), and GetCount() to provide comprehensive performance
    analysis. The histogram may be reset periodically or after reaching a certain
    number of samples, depending on implementation details.
