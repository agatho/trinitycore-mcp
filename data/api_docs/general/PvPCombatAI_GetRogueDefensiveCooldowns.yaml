documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of available defensive cooldowns for a rogue player
    in PvP combat.
  description: The GetRogueDefensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the count
    of defensive abilities that are currently available to a rogue player during PvP
    encounters. This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class which manages AI behavior
    specific to player versus player scenarios. The returned value represents how
    many defensive cooldowns (such as Evasion, Feint, or Cloak of Shadows) can be
    used immediately without waiting for their cooldowns to expire. This information
    is crucial for determining optimal tactical decisions in PvP combat situations
    where timing and resource management are key factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of available defensive cooldowns
    for the rogue player. A value of 0 indicates no defensive abilities are currently
    usable, while higher values indicate more defensive options are available. The
    method returns -1 if the input player reference is invalid or null.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldowns = ai->GetRogueDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldowns > 0) {\n    // Player has defensive cooldowns available\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_EVASION, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking systems within
    the TrinityCore framework. The implementation may vary based on the specific rogue
    specialization and equipped talents. Performance is generally low as it only involves
    checking existing cooldown states rather than complex calculations.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter of type int* player, but the description
    indicates no parameters are expected. This discrepancy should be resolved in actual
    implementation. Using this method without proper null checks may lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior.
