  signature: void QuestCompletion::RecoverFromCompletionFailure(Player * bot, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover a bot player's quest state after a completion failure.
  description: The RecoverFromCompletionFailure method is designed to handle cases
    where a bot player has failed to complete a quest successfully. It resets the
    quest state for the specified quest ID, allowing the bot to retry the quest or
    proceed with other quest-related activities. This method typically involves clearing
    any incomplete quest data and potentially resetting quest timers or flags. The
    recovery process ensures that the bot's quest log remains consistent and functional
    after an unexpected failure during quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot player whose quest
      state needs to be recovered.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that failed to complete. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Recovery Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      uint32 failedQuestId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::RecoverFromCompletionFailure(myBot, failedQuestId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a quest completion failure has occurred.
    It modifies the player's internal quest state and may affect quest-related timers
    or flags. The recovery process does not re-initiate the quest itself, but rather
    prepares the player for potential retry.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the quest failure state
    may lead to inconsistent quest data. Ensure that the bot is in a valid state before
    calling this method to avoid unintended side effects.
