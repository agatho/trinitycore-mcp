documentation:
  brief: Removes a criteria progress from the scenario for the player
  description: The SendCriteriaProgressRemoved method is used to notify the client
    that a specific criteria progress has been removed from a scenario. This typically
    occurs when a player's progress toward completing a scenario objective is reset
    or invalidated, such as when a scenario is restarted or when certain conditions
    are met that cause progress to be cleared. The method sends a packet to the player's
    client to update their UI and remove the corresponding criteria progress display.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The ID of the criteria to be removed from the scenario progress tracking
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Criteria Progress in Scenario
    code: "void RemovePlayerCriteriaProgress(Player* player, uint32 criteriaId)\n\
      {\n    if (Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario())\n    {\n        scenario->SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(criteriaId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the criteria progress is actually
    removed from the scenario tracking system. It's important to ensure that the criteria
    ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing criteria in the scenario.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the criteria ID may result
    in undefined behavior or client-side UI issues. Ensure that the criteria ID exists
    in the scenario before calling this method.
