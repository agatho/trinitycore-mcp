  class: EquipmentManager
  method: GetRecommendedPotionLevel
  signature: uint32 EquipmentManager::GetRecommendedPotionLevel(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the recommended potion level for a player based on their current
    level and equipment.
  description: The GetRecommendedPotionLevel method calculates and returns the optimal
    potion level that a player should use, considering their character's current level
    and equipped items. This value is typically used to determine which health or
    mana potions to recommend or display in the UI. The method takes into account
    various factors such as player's level, gear quality, and potential potion effects.
    It ensures that players are not recommended potions that are too low-level for
    their current progression stage, nor are they suggested potions that exceed their
    character's capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's level. This parameter
      is used to determine the appropriate potion level recommendation based on the
      player's progression.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the recommended potion level. This number
    typically corresponds to the level of potions (e.g., 10, 20, 30) that should be
    recommended for use by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerLevel = 60;

      uint32 recommendedLevel = equipmentManager->GetRecommendedPotionLevel(&playerLevel);

      // Returns recommended potion level based on player level 60'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Object
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nint playerLevel = player->GetLevel();\n\
      uint32 potionLevel = equipmentManager->GetRecommendedPotionLevel(&playerLevel);\n\
      // Use potionLevel to filter available potions in UI or inventory\nif (potionLevel\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Display potions of recommended level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for UI display purposes and may not directly
    affect gameplay mechanics. The implementation likely considers the player's current
    gear, class-specific potion usage, and progression milestones to determine the
    appropriate recommendation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid integer representing
    the player's level. Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could lead to
    unexpected behavior or crashes.
