  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetScaleCurveProgress
  signature: float AreaTrigger::GetScaleCurveProgress(const int & scaleCurve, uint32
    timeTo) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the progress of a scale curve animation for an area
    trigger at a given time.
  description: The GetScaleCurveProgress method computes the interpolation progress
    of a scaling animation defined by a specific curve ID. It takes into account the
    current time relative to the total duration of the animation, returning a normalized
    float value between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents how far along the scale transition
    has progressed. This is commonly used in area triggers to control visual effects
    such as expanding or contracting shapes over time. The method requires a valid
    scale curve identifier and a target time point to determine the progress within
    that curve's timeline.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleCurve
    description: The identifier of the scale curve animation to evaluate. This typically
      corresponds to an entry in the AreaTriggerScript or related scaling data tables.
  - name: timeTo
    description: The absolute time value (in milliseconds) up to which the progress
      should be calculated. This determines where along the curve's timeline the method
      evaluates the current scale factor.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the normalized progress
    of the scale animation at the specified time. A value of 0.0 indicates the start
    of the animation, while 1.0 indicates completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float progress = areaTrigger->GetScaleCurveProgress(5, 2000); // Get progress
      at 2 seconds for curve ID 5
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Scale Calculation
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();

      float currentScale = areaTrigger->GetScaleCurveProgress(10, currentTime);

      float scaleValue = 0.5f + (currentScale * 0.5f); // Linearly interpolate between
      0.5 and 1.0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the area trigger has valid curve data associated
    with it. If the provided scaleCurve ID does not exist or is invalid, the result
    may be undefined or return a default value. The timeTo parameter should typically
    be passed in milliseconds to match TrinityCore's internal timing system.
  warnings: Ensure that the scaleCurve ID corresponds to an actual defined curve in
    the database; otherwise, unexpected behavior might occur. Also, this method is
    not thread-safe and should only be called from within a valid game context where
    time values are properly synchronized.
