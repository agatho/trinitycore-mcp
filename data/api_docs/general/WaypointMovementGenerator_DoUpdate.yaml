  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: DoUpdate
  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::DoUpdate(Creature * param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the waypoint movement generator for a creature, advancing its position
    along the defined path.
  description: The DoUpdate method is responsible for handling the logic of moving
    a creature along a predefined waypoint path. It calculates the next position based
    on the current waypoint and updates the creature's movement state accordingly.
    This method is typically called during each update tick in the game loop to ensure
    smooth movement behavior. The method returns true if the movement was successfully
    updated, or false when the creature has reached the end of its path or encountered
    an error condition.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that is following the waypoint path.
      This represents the entity whose movement state will be updated.
  - name: param1
    description: The update time delta in milliseconds since the last update call.
      Used to calculate precise movement timing and interpolation.
  returns: Returns true if the creature's position was successfully updated along
    the waypoint path, or false if the creature has reached the end of its path, is
    invalid, or encountered an error during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator\
      \ && m_movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType() == WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE)\n\
      \    {\n        WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = static_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(m_movementGenerator);\n\
      \        wpGen->DoUpdate(me, diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking movement completion
    code: "bool HandleWaypointMovement(Creature* creature, uint32 diff)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!creature || !creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE)\n        return false;\n\n    WaypointMovementGenerator*\
      \ wpGen = static_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(\n        creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \    \n    bool updated = wpGen->DoUpdate(creature, diff);\n    if (!updated)\n\
      \    {\n        // Path completed or error occurred\n        creature->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's movement system and integrates with
    the Creature's MotionMaster. The implementation handles waypoint interpolation,
    speed calculations, and ensures proper path completion detection. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called frequently but not excessively to avoid unnecessary
    overhead.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on a creature that is not currently using
    a WaypointMovementGenerator. Ensure the creature pointer is valid before calling
    to prevent crashes. The method assumes the waypoint data is properly initialized
    and accessible.
