  method: GetAoETargets
  signature: int DemonHunterAI::GetAoETargets(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of valid targets within the specified AoE
    range for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The GetAoETargets method determines how many enemy units are within
    a given range around the Demon Hunter AI's current position. This method is typically
    used during spell or ability casting to identify potential targets for area-of-effect
    attacks. It evaluates the current environment and returns a count of valid targets
    that meet the criteria for AoE engagement, such as being in combat range and not
    invulnerable. The method does not perform any actions itself but provides essential
    data for decision-making in AI behavior logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid targets found within
    the specified AoE range. A return value of 0 indicates no suitable targets were
    found, while a positive integer indicates the count of available targets for area-of-effect
    abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::ExecuteCombatAction()\n{\n    int targetCount = GetAoETargets(10.0f);\n\
      \    if (targetCount >= 3)\n    {\n        // Cast AoE spell\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_DEMON_BLADE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI target selection logic and may consider
    factors such as target visibility, threat level, and combat state. The range parameter
    is typically defined in yards and represents the maximum distance from the Demon
    Hunter's position to consider targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value passed to this method is appropriate for the
    intended spell or ability being used, as using an incorrect range may lead to
    ineffective targeting or casting.
