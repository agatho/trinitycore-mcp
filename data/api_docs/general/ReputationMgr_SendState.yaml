  method: SendState
  signature: void ReputationMgr::SendState(const FactionState * faction)
documentation:
  brief: Sends the reputation state for a specified faction to the player's client.
  description: The SendState method is responsible for transmitting the current reputation
    status of a specific faction to the player's game client. This includes details
    such as the faction's standing, any changes in reputation, and visual indicators
    like faction icons or text labels that reflect the player's relationship with
    that faction. The method typically gets invoked when a player's reputation with
    a faction changes or when the client needs an updated view of their faction standings.
    It ensures that the UI accurately reflects the player's current standing with
    various factions in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: faction
    description: A pointer to the FactionState structure containing the reputation
      data for a specific faction. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid faction entry within the game's faction system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Reputation State for a Specific Faction
    code: "ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nFactionState const*\
      \ factionState = repMgr->GetFactionState(1234); // Example faction ID\nif (factionState)\n\
      {\n    repMgr->SendState(factionState);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client-side UI rendering system,
    so it should only be called when necessary to avoid unnecessary network traffic.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with reputation change events or during initial
    login to synchronize faction states.
