documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 64-bit data value associated with the game object AI.
  description: The GetData64 method is used to retrieve a 64-bit unsigned integer
    value that is typically associated with the GameObjectAI instance. This method
    serves as a generic accessor for custom data stored within the AI system, often
    used in quest scripting or event handling where specific identifiers or flags
    need to be maintained. The method does not take any parameters and returns a uint64
    value representing the requested data. It's commonly implemented in custom GameObjectAI
    classes to provide access to unique identifiers, state information, or other game-specific
    values needed for complex interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer value that represents the requested data associated
    with this GameObject AI instance. The actual meaning of this value depends on
    how it was set by the implementing class and can vary based on use case, such
    as a GUID, state flag, or custom identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve stored data
    code: "uint64 data = gameObject->GetAI()->GetData64();\n// Use the retrieved data\
      \ for conditional logic\nif (data == 12345)\n{\n    // Perform specific action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetData64 in quest event handling
    code: "class QuestGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    uint64 GetData64(uint32\
      \ param0) const override\n    {\n        return m_questId;\n    }\n    \nprivate:\n\
      \    uint64 m_questId = 0;\n};\n\n// Later in quest code\nuint64 questId = go->GetAI()->GetData64();\n\
      if (questId == 54321)\n{\n    // Trigger quest-specific behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden in custom GameObjectAI implementations
    to provide specific data retrieval functionality. The returned value should be
    interpreted based on the implementation context, as it's designed to be flexible
    for various use cases. Since this is a const method, it should not modify any
    internal state of the GameObjectAI instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the implementing class properly initializes and manages the
    data being returned by GetData64. Calling this method without proper initialization
    may result in unexpected values or behavior. The method signature suggests it
    might be intended to accept a parameter for specifying what type of data to retrieve,
    but currently takes no parameters, so implementations should handle this appropriately.
