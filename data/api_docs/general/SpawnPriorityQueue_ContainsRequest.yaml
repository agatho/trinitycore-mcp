  signature: bool SpawnPriorityQueue::ContainsRequest(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific GUID exists within the spawn priority queue.
  description: The ContainsRequest method determines whether a given global unique
    identifier (GUID) is present in the spawn priority queue. This queue manages the
    order in which game objects or entities should be spawned during world initialization
    or dynamic spawning events. The method performs a lookup operation to verify if
    the specified GUID has been added to the queue, returning true if found and false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper spawn ordering
    and avoiding duplicate spawns in TrinityCore's entity management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified GUID exists in the spawn priority queue;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawnQueue.ContainsRequest(12345)) {\n    // Handle case where GUID\
      \ 12345 is already queued for spawning\n    printf(\"GUID 12345 is in the spawn\
      \ queue\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Duplicate Spawns
    code: "uint32 newGuid = GetNextSpawnGuid();\nif (!spawnQueue.ContainsRequest(newGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Add to queue only if not already present\n    spawnQueue.AddRequest(newGuid);\n\
      \    // Proceed with spawning logic\n} else {\n    // Skip spawning as it's\
      \ already queued\n    printf(\"Skipping duplicate spawn for GUID %u\\n\", newGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a linear search through the internal queue structure,
    so performance may degrade with large queues. It is recommended to use this method
    sparingly in performance-critical sections of code. The implementation assumes
    thread safety for read operations, but concurrent modifications should be avoided.
  warnings: This method does not modify the queue state; it only performs a read operation.
    Be cautious when using this in multithreaded environments where the queue might
    be modified concurrently by other threads without proper synchronization.
