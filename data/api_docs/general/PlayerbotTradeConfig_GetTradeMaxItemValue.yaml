  signature: uint32 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeMaxItemValue()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum item value allowed for trading in player bot trades.
  description: The GetTradeMaxItemValue method returns the configured maximum value
    of items that a player bot is allowed to trade. This value is typically used by
    the TrinityCore AI system to determine whether an item's worth exceeds the threshold
    for inclusion in a trade offer. The returned value represents the upper limit
    in copper coins, and it may be influenced by configuration settings or bot behavior
    rules. This method does not perform any validation on the item itself but rather
    returns a static or dynamic value based on the bot's trade configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum item value allowed for trading
    in copper coins. This value defines the upper bound of item worth that can be
    included in a trade offer by the player bot.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum trade item value
    code: "uint32 maxTradeValue = bot->GetTradeMaxItemValue();\nif (maxTradeValue\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with trade logic using maxTradeValue\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      playerbots\", \"Maximum trade item value is {} copper.\", maxTradeValue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotTradeConfig class and likely depends
    on configuration values defined in the TrinityCore AI settings. It may be affected
    by dynamic adjustments based on bot level, faction, or other contextual factors.
