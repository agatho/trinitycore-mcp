  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: PredictInterception
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::PredictInterception(const int & target, const int
    & targetVel, const int & interceptor, float interceptorSpeed)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the time until an interceptor reaches a moving target's predicted
    position.
  description: The PredictInterception method computes the interception time for a
    moving interceptor to reach a target that is also in motion. It uses basic kinematic
    equations to determine when and where the interceptor will meet the target's future
    location, assuming both move in straight lines at constant speeds. This function
    is commonly used in game AI systems for missile guidance, pet targeting, or spell
    trajectory calculations. The method requires knowledge of the target's current
    position and velocity, as well as the interceptor's starting position and speed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The initial position of the moving target (in game coordinates).
  - name: targetVel
    description: The velocity vector or speed component of the target's movement.
  - name: interceptor
    description: The starting position of the interceptor (in game coordinates).
  - name: interceptorSpeed
    description: The constant speed at which the interceptor moves towards the target.
  returns: Returns the time (in seconds or game ticks) until interception occurs.
    A negative value indicates no valid interception is possible, such as when the
    interceptor cannot catch up to a moving target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interception Calculation
    code: 'int targetPos = 100;

      int targetVelocity = 5;

      int interceptorPos = 0;

      float speed = 10.0f;

      int time = ObstacleUtils::PredictInterception(targetPos, targetVelocity, interceptorPos,
      speed);

      // Returns time until interception'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interception for Projectile AI
    code: "float projectileSpeed = 20.0f;\nint targetX = player->GetPositionX();\n\
      int targetVelX = player->GetSpeedX();\nint projectileX = cannon->GetPositionX();\n\
      int interceptTime = ObstacleUtils::PredictInterception(targetX, targetVelX,\
      \ projectileX, projectileSpeed);\nif (interceptTime >= 0)\n{\n    // Calculate\
      \ future position and aim accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes linear motion with constant velocity for both the target
    and interceptor. It does not account for acceleration, gravity, or complex movement
    patterns. The calculation may fail if the interceptor speed is insufficient to
    reach the target's projected path.
  warnings: The function returns a negative value when interception is impossible,
    which should be handled carefully in calling code. Be cautious of floating-point
    precision issues when dealing with very small differences in speeds or positions.
