  class: Guild
  method: SendEventPlayerLeft
  signature: void Guild::SendEventPlayerLeft(Member * leaver, Member * remover, bool
    isRemoved) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event notification when a player leaves the guild, including
    details about the leaver and remover.
  description: The SendEventPlayerLeft method is responsible for broadcasting a guild
    event message to all online guild members when a player exits the guild. This
    method handles the communication of player departure information, distinguishing
    between voluntary exits and forced removals by guild leaders or officers. It ensures
    that all guild members are notified of the change in membership, maintaining transparency
    and synchronization within the guild's communication system. The method takes
    into account whether the player was removed (as opposed to leaving voluntarily)
    and who performed the action, allowing for appropriate messaging and logging.
  parameters:
  - name: leaver
    description: Pointer to the Member object representing the player who left or
      was removed from the guild. This parameter cannot be null.
  - name: remover
    description: Pointer to the Member object representing the player who initiated
      the removal action (can be null if player left voluntarily).
  - name: isRemoved
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player was removed from the guild
      (true) or left voluntarily (false).
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Notify guild members when a player is removed
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      Member* leaver = guild->GetMember("PlayerName");

      Member* remover = guild->GetMember("OfficerName");

      guild->SendEventPlayerLeft(leaver, remover, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Notify guild members when a player leaves voluntarily
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      Member* leaver = guild->GetMember("PlayerName");

      guild->SendEventPlayerLeft(leaver, nullptr, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Guild class when handling
    player leave/remove operations. It sends a packet to all online guild members
    using the SMSG_GUILD_EVENT_PLAYER_LEFT opcode. The method does not perform any
    validation on the input parameters beyond ensuring they are not null (for leaver).
    Thread safety should be considered as this method may be called from different
    threads during guild operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Member pointers passed to this method are valid and represent
    actual guild members, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Do not call this
    method with a null leaver parameter as it will likely cause crashes or incorrect
    messaging. This method assumes all members are online and properly initialized
    for message delivery.
