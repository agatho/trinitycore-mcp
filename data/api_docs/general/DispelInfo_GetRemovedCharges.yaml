  signature: uint8 DispelInfo::GetRemovedCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of charges removed during a dispel effect.
  description: The GetRemovedCharges method retrieves the count of charges that were
    stripped from an aura or spell effect when a dispel operation occurred. This value
    is typically used in conjunction with dispel mechanics to determine how many applications
    of a buff or debuff were eliminated. The method provides insight into the effectiveness
    of dispel actions and can be crucial for calculating damage, healing, or stat
    modifications that depend on aura stacks. It's commonly invoked during spell processing
    and combat log events when dispels are applied to affected units.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of charges that were removed from
    the dispelled aura or effect. Returns 0 if no charges were removed or if the dispel
    was unsuccessful.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dispel Handler
    code: "void HandleDispel(Unit* caster, Unit* target, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    if (DispelInfo* dispelInfo = target->GetDispelInfo())\n    {\n      \
      \  uint8 removedCharges = dispelInfo->GetRemovedCharges();\n        if (removedCharges\
      \ > 0)\n        {\n            // Process the dispel effect based on number\
      \ of charges removed\n            SendDispelLog(caster, target, spellInfo, removedCharges);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after a successful dispel event has been
    processed. The returned value reflects the actual number of charges stripped from
    the aura, which may differ from the total stack count if only partial removal
    occurred. Developers should ensure that the DispelInfo object exists and has been
    properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null DispelInfo pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the target unit has active dispel information before
    invoking GetRemovedCharges().
