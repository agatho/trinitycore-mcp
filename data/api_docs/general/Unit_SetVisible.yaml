  class: Unit
  method: SetVisible
  signature: void Unit::SetVisible(bool x)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visibility state of the unit to visible or invisible.
  description: The SetVisible method controls whether a unit (such as a player or
    creature) is visible or invisible in the game world. When called with true, the
    unit becomes visible; when called with false, the unit becomes invisible. This
    method affects the unit's visibility status and can be used to control visibility
    for players, NPCs, or other units in the game. The visibility state impacts how
    other players see the unit and can affect gameplay mechanics such as stealth,
    invisibility, or visibility in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the unit should be visible (true)
      or invisible (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic visibility change example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetPlayer();


      // Make player visible

      target->SetVisible(true);


      // Make player invisible

      target->SetVisible(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    methods like SetDisplayId or SetFlag. It's important to note that setting visibility
    may not immediately affect the unit's appearance if other flags or states are
    also involved. The method may be called from various game contexts including combat,
    stealth, or general gameplay.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in combat situations without understanding
    of the implications on visibility and stealth mechanics. Using this method to
    set visibility during combat can cause unexpected behavior or visual artifacts
    for other players.
