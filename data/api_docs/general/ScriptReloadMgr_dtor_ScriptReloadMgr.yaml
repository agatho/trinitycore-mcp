documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ScriptReloadMgr instance and performs cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the ScriptReloadMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes releasing
    memory, unregistering callbacks, or performing other necessary cleanup tasks to
    ensure no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. In the context of
    TrinityCore, this class likely manages script reloading functionality, and its
    destructor ensures that all associated script-related resources are properly released
    before the object is removed from memory.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ScriptReloadMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ScriptReloadMgr* mgr = new ScriptReloadMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Triggers ~ScriptReloadMgr()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other threads are accessing
    the manager during destruction to prevent race conditions.
