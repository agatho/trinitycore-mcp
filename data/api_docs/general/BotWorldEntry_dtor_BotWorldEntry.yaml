documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotWorldEntry instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotWorldEntry class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method is automatically invoked when a BotWorldEntry object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation
    and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework. The destructor may
    also handle cleanup of internal data structures related to bot world entries,
    such as cached data or references to game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotWorldEntry object
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    BotWorldEntry entry;\n    // ... use the\
      \ entry ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when 'entry' goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotWorldEntry pointer
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();

      // ... use the entry ...

      delete entry; // Triggers destructor

      entry = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    principles. It's important to ensure that all derived classes properly call their
    base class destructors if they have any cleanup requirements. In TrinityCore,
    this destructor may be invoked during server shutdown or when bot instances are
    removed from the world.
  warnings: Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime. Calling a destructor directly on an already destroyed object
    leads to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other threads are accessing
    the object when its destructor is called.
