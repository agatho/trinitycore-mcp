documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a felhunter pet.
  description: The IsPetFelhunter method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a felhunter pet in the World of Warcraft game. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore server implementation to differentiate between various types of
    summoned pets, particularly those belonging to warlocks. It returns true if the
    minion is specifically a felhunter, and false otherwise. The check is performed
    based on internal pet type identification mechanisms within the Minion class hierarchy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a felhunter pet; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for felhunter pet
    code: "if (minion->IsPetFelhunter()) {\n    // Handle felhunter specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This minion is a felhunter.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic with pet management
    code: "Unit* owner = minion->GetOwner();\nif (owner && owner->IsPlayer() && minion->IsPetFelhunter())\
      \ {\n    Player* player = owner->ToPlayer();\n    // Apply felhunter-specific\
      \ effects or modifications\n    player->AddSpellCooldown(19505, 0, 30000); //\
      \ Felhunter's Shadow Bolt cooldown\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal pet type flags and should only be called on
    valid minion instances. The implementation assumes that the minion has been properly
    initialized and is associated with a valid owner. Performance impact is minimal
    as it's a simple flag check.
  warnings: Ensure that the minion pointer is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. This method should only be used when working with
    warlock pets, as felhunter is a specific pet type for warlocks.
