documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BGData class with default values for all
    member variables.
  description: The BGData constructor initializes a new instance of the BGData class,
    setting up internal data structures and member variables to their default states.
    This method is typically invoked when creating a new battleground data object,
    which holds information about battleground instances, players, teams, and related
    game state data. The constructor ensures that all internal fields are properly
    initialized before the object can be used in battleground operations such as player
    registration, team management, or scoring calculations. It does not accept any
    parameters and performs no complex initialization logic beyond setting default
    values for its members.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BGData instance
    code: 'BGData* battleground = new BGData();

      // The BGData object is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used for managing battleground data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when a BGData object is instantiated.
    It's important to note that while the object is initialized, it may not contain
    valid battleground-specific data until other methods like LoadFromDB() or SetBattlegroundId()
    are invoked. The class likely contains member variables for storing player counts,
    team scores, and battleground metadata.
