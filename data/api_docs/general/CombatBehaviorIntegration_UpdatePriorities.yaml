  method: UpdatePriorities
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::UpdatePriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority levels of combat behaviors based on current threat and
    target conditions.
  description: The UpdatePriorities method recalculates and adjusts the execution
    priorities of various combat behaviors within the CombatBehaviorIntegration system.
    This method is typically invoked during combat updates to ensure that the most
    relevant and effective behaviors are executed first, taking into account factors
    such as target threat level, player health, available resources, and combat state.
    It dynamically reorders behavior priorities to optimize combat performance and
    decision-making in real-time scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatAI::Update()\n{\n    m_combatBehaviorIntegration->UpdatePriorities();\n\
      \    // Execute highest priority behavior\n    m_combatBehaviorIntegration->ExecuteNextBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during combat updates, typically
    every tick or at regular intervals. It performs internal calculations that may
    involve checking target status, player stats, and behavior cooldowns. The implementation
    likely uses a priority queue or similar structure to manage behavior ordering.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat context may result in incorrect
    prioritization logic if behaviors depend on active combat state conditions. Ensure
    that the method is only invoked when appropriate combat state is active to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
