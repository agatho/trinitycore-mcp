  method: HasSpellCastItem
  signature: bool TradeData::HasSpellCastItem() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the trade contains an item that casts a spell upon being
    traded.
  description: The HasSpellCastItem method checks if any item in the current trade
    window has a spell effect associated with it, typically used for items that trigger
    spells when traded. This functionality is essential for handling special trade
    mechanics such as consumable items or quest items that have spell effects. The
    method returns true if at least one item in the trade data has a spell cast property;
    otherwise, it returns false. This check is commonly performed during trade validation
    and processing to ensure proper handling of spell-triggered items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any item in the trade data has a spell cast effect associated
    with it, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Spell-Cast Items in Trade
    code: "if (tradeData->HasSpellCastItem()) {\n    // Handle special trade logic\
      \ for items that cast spells\n    sLog->outString(\"Trade contains spell-cast\
      \ items\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal trade processing\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No spell-cast items in trade\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with trade validation logic
    to ensure that special items are handled correctly during the trading process.
    It may be called multiple times during a trade session, particularly when checking
    item validity or applying trade restrictions.
