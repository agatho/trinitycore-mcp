  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: CalculateSpawnInterval
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::CalculateSpawnInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the adaptive spawn interval in milliseconds for creature
    or game object spawning.
  description: The CalculateSpawnInterval method determines the appropriate time interval
    between spawns based on current server load, player activity, and configured throttling
    parameters. This adaptive mechanism helps balance server performance and gameplay
    experience by dynamically adjusting how frequently new creatures or game objects
    are spawned into the world. The returned value represents the delay in milliseconds
    before the next spawn event should occur. This method is typically used internally
    by the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class to manage spawn scheduling and prevent excessive
    resource consumption during peak player activity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated spawn interval in milliseconds.
    A value of 0 indicates that no spawn should occur immediately, while larger values
    indicate longer delays before the next spawn event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      uint32 interval = throttler.CalculateSpawnInterval();

      // Use interval to schedule next spawn event

      printf("Next spawn in %u milliseconds\n", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spawn Scheduler
    code: "class CreatureSpawner {\npublic:\n    void ScheduleNextSpawn() {\n    \
      \    AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\n        uint32 delay = throttler.CalculateSpawnInterval();\n\
      \        // Schedule timer for next spawn\n        sWorld->ScheduleBackgroundTask([delay]()\
      \ {\n            // Spawn logic here\n        }, delay);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently and should not perform heavy
    computations. The actual implementation likely considers factors such as current
    player count, server load average, and configuration settings from the world configuration.
    The return value is cached internally and may vary between calls based on dynamic
    conditions.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended throttling context as
    it relies on internal state that may not be properly initialized or updated in
    other scenarios. The returned interval values should be used directly for scheduling,
    not modified or interpreted as absolute timestamps.
