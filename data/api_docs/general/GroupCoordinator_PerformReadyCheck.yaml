  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::PerformReadyCheck()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a ready check for all group members
  description: The PerformReadyCheck method starts a ready check process for the current
    group, sending a ready check request to all group members. This mechanism is used
    in World of Warcraft to determine if all players in a group are prepared to proceed
    with an activity such as entering a dungeon, raid, or starting a quest. The method
    returns true if the ready check was successfully initiated, and false if it failed
    due to invalid group state or other conditions. During a ready check, each player
    has a limited time to respond with their readiness status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ready check was successfully initiated for all group
    members; returns false if the group is invalid, empty, or if the ready check could
    not be started due to game state restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PerformReadyCheck
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->PerformReadyCheck()) {\n    // Ready check initiated\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Ready check started for group\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Failed to initiate ready check\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to\
      \ start ready check\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the GroupCoordinator when a leader wants
    to ensure all group members are prepared before proceeding with an action. The
    actual ready check responses are handled asynchronously by the client and server,
    and this method only initiates the process.
