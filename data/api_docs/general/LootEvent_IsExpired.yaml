documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a loot event has expired based on its time-to-live or cooldown
    period.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a LootEvent object has exceeded
    its valid duration or cooldown period, making it no longer eligible for loot distribution.
    This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to
    manage dynamic loot systems such as quest rewards, creature drops, or event-based
    item acquisition. It evaluates internal timestamps or counters associated with
    the loot event and returns true if the event is no longer active, false otherwise.
    The expiration logic may be based on real-time elapsed duration, server tick counts,
    or specific game state conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot event has expired and can no longer be used for
    loot distribution; returns false if the event is still valid and active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: "if (lootEvent.IsExpired()) {\n    // Handle expired loot event\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Loot event has expired.\");\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal loot processing"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Expiration Before Reward Distribution
    code: "LootEvent* event = player->GetLootEvent();\nif (event && !event->IsExpired())\
      \ {\n    // Distribute rewards\n    player->AddItem(event->GetRewardItemId(),\
      \ event->GetRewardItemCount());\n} else {\n    // Notify player that reward\
      \ is no longer available\n    player->SendNotification(\"The loot event has\
      \ expired.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal time tracking mechanisms such as std::chrono
    or server tick counters to determine expiration. It's important to note that expired
    events may still exist in memory but are considered inactive for loot purposes.
    The exact expiration criteria (e.g., time-based, count-based) depend on how the
    LootEvent was initialized and configured.
  warnings: Do not assume that an event is valid just because IsExpired() returns
    false; always verify other conditions such as player eligibility or item availability
    before attempting loot distribution. Calling this method on a null pointer will
    result in undefined behavior.
