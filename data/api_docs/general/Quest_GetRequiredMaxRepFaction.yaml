  method: GetRequiredMaxRepFaction
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRequiredMaxRepFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum reputation faction required for quest completion.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum reputation faction that a player
    must reach to complete the specified quest. It is used in conjunction with the
    GetRequiredMinRepFaction method to determine the full reputation requirements
    for a quest. The returned value represents the faction ID that defines the upper
    limit of reputation needed for quest completion, typically used in quest reward
    calculations and reputation system interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the faction ID (uint32) representing the maximum reputation faction
    required for quest completion. This value corresponds to a specific faction in
    the game's reputation system, usually indicating the highest faction level that
    players must achieve to complete the quest successfully.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxRepFaction = quest->GetRequiredMaxRepFaction();\nif (maxRepFaction\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the faction ID\n    // This could be used to check\
      \ if player's reputation meets requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system's reputation management and should
    be used in conjunction with other reputation-related methods. It typically returns
    0 for quests that do not require reputation-based completion, indicating no faction-based
    requirement exists.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return 0 for quests without reputation requirements,
    which could lead to incorrect assumptions about quest completion conditions if
    not properly handled in code logic.
