  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: ApplyDiminishingReturns
  signature: float CooldownStackingOptimizer::ApplyDiminishingReturns(float baseMultiplier,
    uint32 stackCount) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies diminishing returns scaling to a cooldown multiplier based on stack
    count.
  description: The ApplyDiminishingReturns method modifies a base cooldown multiplier
    by applying a diminishing returns formula that reduces the effectiveness of additional
    stacks. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft mechanics where effects like
    haste or cooldown reduction follow diminishing returns as more stacks are applied.
    The method takes a base multiplier and a stack count, then returns the adjusted
    multiplier after applying the diminishing returns calculation. This ensures that
    stacking effects do not become overpowered by providing a mathematical curve that
    limits the maximum benefit from additional stacks.
  parameters:
  - name: baseMultiplier
    description: The initial cooldown reduction multiplier (e.g., 0.5 for 50% reduction).
      Must be a positive float value.
  - name: stackCount
    description: The number of stacks applied to the effect. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing how many times the effect has been stacked.
  returns: Returns the adjusted cooldown multiplier after applying diminishing returns
    scaling. The value will typically be less than or equal to the baseMultiplier,
    with the reduction becoming smaller as stackCount increases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float reducedCooldown = optimizer.ApplyDiminishingReturns(0.5f, 3); // Applies
      diminishing returns to 50% cooldown reduction with 3 stacks
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Count Effect Demonstration
    code: "for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {\n    float result = optimizer.ApplyDiminishingReturns(0.3f,\
      \ i);\n    std::cout << \"Stacks: \" << i << \", Multiplier: \" << result <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely implements a diminishing returns curve such as 1 - (1
    - baseMultiplier) / (1 + stackCount * diminishingFactor). The exact formula may
    vary depending on the specific implementation in TrinityCore. Performance is generally
    negligible for this type of calculation.
  warnings: Ensure that baseMultiplier is positive and stackCount is non-negative
    to avoid unexpected behavior or mathematical errors in the diminishing returns
    calculation.
