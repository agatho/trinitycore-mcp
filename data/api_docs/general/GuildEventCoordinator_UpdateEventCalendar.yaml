documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild event calendar for a specified event ID.
  description: The UpdateEventCalendar method synchronizes and refreshes the guild
    event calendar data for a given event identifier. This method is typically invoked
    when there are changes to event details, such as start time, end time, or event
    status, ensuring that all guild members see the most current information in their
    calendar views. It may also trigger notifications or updates to related systems
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates on a per-event basis and
    does not affect other events in the calendar.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild event to be updated. Must correspond
      to an existing event in the guild's calendar system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a Guild Event Calendar Entry
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventCalendar(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal event storage and may involve
    database synchronization. It is recommended to validate the existence of the event
    ID before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent eventId may lead to
    undefined behavior or errors in the calendar system. Ensure that the event exists
    prior to invoking this function.
