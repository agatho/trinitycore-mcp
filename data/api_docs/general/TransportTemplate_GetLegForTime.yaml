  method: GetLegForTime
  signature: const TransportPathLeg * TransportTemplate::GetLegForTime(int time) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the transport path leg corresponding to a given time during the
    transport's movement cycle.
  description: The GetLegForTime method calculates and returns the TransportPathLeg
    that is currently active at a specified time value within the transport's movement
    cycle. This method is typically used to determine which segment of a transport's
    path is being traversed at a particular moment, enabling accurate positioning
    and timing calculations for transports such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving
    objects in the game world. The time parameter is usually expressed in milliseconds
    and represents the elapsed time since the transport began its movement cycle.
    This method assumes that the transport's path legs are ordered sequentially and
    that the time value wraps around the total duration of the transport's cycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const TransportPathLeg object representing the leg of the
    transport path active at the specified time, or nullptr if the time does not correspond
    to any valid leg in the transport's path.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve the current transport leg for a given time
    code: "int currentTime = 5000; // 5 seconds into the cycle\nconst TransportPathLeg*\
      \ currentLeg = transportTemplate->GetLegForTime(currentTime);\nif (currentLeg\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the current leg information\n    printf(\"\
      Current leg ID: %d\\n\", currentLeg->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal structure of TransportPathLegs being properly
    ordered and the transport's total cycle time being correctly calculated. It may
    not be thread-safe if multiple threads access the same transport template concurrently
    without synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the time value passed to this method is within the expected
    range of the transport's movement cycle; otherwise, it may return nullptr or an
    incorrect leg. The method assumes sequential ordering of path legs and does not
    validate the integrity of the path data.
