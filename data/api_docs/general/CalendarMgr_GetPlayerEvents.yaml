documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all calendar events associated with a specific player identified
    by their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerEvents method fetches a collection of calendar events
    that are linked to a particular player within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's calendar system,
    where players can create, invite others to, and manage various in-game events
    such as raids, dungeons, or social gatherings. The returned CalendarEventStore
    contains all relevant event data for the specified player, including event details,
    invites, and associated timestamps. This method does not modify any state and
    is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CalendarEventStore object containing all calendar events for the specified
    player. If no events exist for the given GUID, an empty store is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Events for a Player
    code: "CalendarEventStore events = calendarMgr->GetPlayerEvents(12345);\nfor (const\
      \ auto& event : events)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event: \" << event->GetTitle()\
      \ << \" at \" << event->GetEventTime() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    character in the database. The returned CalendarEventStore may contain events
    from different types (raid, dungeon, holiday, etc.) and should be filtered or
    processed accordingly based on game logic requirements.
