  method: OnShutdown
  signature: void QuestManager::OnShutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for all active quests in the quest
    manager.
  description: The OnShutdown method is called during server shutdown to gracefully
    terminate all active quest sessions and release associated resources. This method
    ensures that no quest data is lost during server termination by properly saving
    quest states, notifying relevant subsystems, and cleaning up internal quest tracking
    structures. It typically iterates through all currently active quests, triggers
    any necessary cleanup callbacks, and resets the quest manager's internal state
    to prepare for shutdown. The method is designed to be called once during the server's
    finalization phase, ensuring that all quest-related data is properly persisted
    before the server process ends.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "void World::HandleShutdown()\n{\n    sQuestMgr->OnShutdown();\n    // Proceed\
      \ with other shutdown procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown sequence. It is
    not intended for regular quest management operations and may leave the quest manager
    in an inconsistent state if invoked outside of proper shutdown context.
  warnings: Calling OnShutdown() outside of the normal server shutdown process can
    result in data loss or undefined behavior. This method assumes that no other threads
    are actively using the quest manager during execution.
