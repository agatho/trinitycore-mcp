api:
  class: LootCoordination
  method: BroadcastLootRecommendations
  signature: void LootCoordination::BroadcastLootRecommendations(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts loot recommendations to group members for a specific item.
  description: The BroadcastLootRecommendations method sends loot recommendation data
    to all members of a specified group for a given loot item. This functionality
    is typically used in group loot scenarios, such as when a player rolls need or
    greed on an item and the system needs to communicate this decision to other group
    members. The method ensures that all relevant players within the group are informed
    about the loot distribution decisions made by individual members. It operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's loot coordination system, which manages how
    items are distributed among group members according to various loot rules and
    player preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose members
      will receive the loot recommendations. Must be a valid group instance with at
      least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being recommended for loot. This includes item ID, stack size, and
      other loot-related metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a loot recommendation for a group
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      // ... populate other item fields

      lootCoordination->BroadcastLootRecommendations(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot processing when a player makes
    a loot decision (need, greed, or pass). The implementation likely uses internal
    messaging systems to efficiently distribute the recommendation data to all group
    members without causing performance bottlenecks. It assumes that the group and
    item parameters are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The LootItem
    structure must be fully populated with valid data to avoid sending incorrect loot
    recommendations to players.
