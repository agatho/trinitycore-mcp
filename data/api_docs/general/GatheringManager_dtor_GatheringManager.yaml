  signature: void GatheringManager::~GatheringManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GatheringManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~GatheringManager destructor is automatically invoked when a GatheringManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, registered callbacks, or internal
    data structures used by the gathering system. It is part of the standard C++ RAII
    (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern and should not be called manually.
    The destructor guarantees that all resources are freed appropriately to prevent
    memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of GatheringManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    GatheringManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object's scope
    ends. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. It is safe to assume that all internal systems
    will be properly shut down during destruction.
