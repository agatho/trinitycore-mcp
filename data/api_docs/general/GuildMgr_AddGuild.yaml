  class: GuildMgr
  method: AddGuild
  signature: void GuildMgr::AddGuild(Guild * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a guild to the guild manager's internal collection for tracking and
    management purposes.
  description: The AddGuild method is responsible for registering a new Guild object
    within the GuildMgr system. This allows the server to maintain an up-to-date list
    of all active guilds, enabling features such as guild lookup, member management,
    and cross-guild communication. The method typically gets invoked during guild
    creation or when loading existing guild data from the database. It ensures that
    the guild is properly integrated into the game's guild infrastructure and can
    be accessed by other systems using the guild's unique identifier.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: A pointer to the Guild object that should be added to the manager's
      collection. This parameter must not be null, as passing a null pointer will
      likely result in undefined behavior or a crash.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a newly created guild
    code: 'Guild* newGuild = new Guild();

      // ... initialize guild properties ...

      GuildMgr::instance()->AddGuild(newGuild);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a guild loaded from database
    code: "Guild* loadedGuild = LoadGuildFromDB(guildId);\nif (loadedGuild)\n{\n \
      \   GuildMgr::instance()->AddGuild(loadedGuild);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game server during guild
    creation or loading phases. Developers should ensure that the Guild object passed
    to this method is fully initialized before calling AddGuild, as any incomplete
    initialization may lead to inconsistent behavior in other systems that rely on
    the guild data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that all Guild objects are properly allocated and initialized
    before adding them to the manager. Also, avoid calling AddGuild multiple times
    with the same Guild object as it may lead to duplicate entries or memory issues.
