documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement speed of a unit for a specific movement type.
  description: 'The SetSpeed method allows developers to modify the speed of a Unit
    object for a given movement type. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore to adjust unit movement speeds during various game events, such as
    combat, movement, or special abilities. The method accepts two parameters: the
    movement type and the new speed value. It directly affects how fast the unit moves
    in the game world, which can influence gameplay mechanics like combat timing,
    pathfinding, and ability cooldowns.'
  parameters:
  - name: mtype
    description: The movement type (UnitMoveType) to set the speed for. Valid values
      include MovementType, Walk, Run, Swim, Fly, and others. This parameter determines
      which movement type is affected by the speed change.
  - name: newValue
    description: The new speed value to set for the specified movement type. This
      value represents the speed in units per second, where 1.0 corresponds to normal
      speed. Values can be positive or negative, and may affect different aspects
      of unit movement depending on the movement type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      Unit::SetSpeed(target, UnitMoveType::Walk, 2.5f);

      // Sets the target''s walking speed to 2.5 times normal speed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = GetPlayer();

      Unit::SetSpeed(player, UnitMoveType::Run, 1.0f);

      // Sets the player''s running speed to normal speed

      // This is useful for adjusting speed after a special ability or buff'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly impacts unit movement behavior in the game world. It
    should be used carefully as it affects pathfinding, combat mechanics, and other
    game systems. The implementation typically involves updating internal movement
    speed parameters for the unit's specific movement type.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect movement behavior, such
    as units moving too fast or too slow, which may cause issues with combat mechanics
    or pathfinding. Care should be taken when setting negative values or values that
    exceed normal speed limits.
