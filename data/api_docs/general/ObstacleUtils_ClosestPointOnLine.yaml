  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: ClosestPointOnLine
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::ClosestPointOnLine(const int & point, const int &
    lineStart, const int & lineEnd)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the closest point on a line segment to a given point in 3D space.
  description: The ClosestPointOnLine method computes the point on a line segment
    defined by two endpoints (lineStart and lineEnd) that is closest to a specified
    point. This utility function is commonly used in pathfinding, collision detection,
    and AI behavior calculations within the TrinityCore framework. The method takes
    three integer parameters representing coordinates of the point and the line segment's
    start and end positions. It returns an integer value representing the calculated
    closest point on the line segment. The implementation typically uses vector mathematics
    to determine the orthogonal projection of the point onto the line and clamps it
    to the segment bounds if necessary.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: The coordinate of the point for which to find the closest point on
      the line. Represented as an integer value.
  - name: lineStart
    description: The starting coordinate of the line segment. Represented as an integer
      value.
  - name: lineEnd
    description: The ending coordinate of the line segment. Represented as an integer
      value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the closest point on the line segment to
    the specified point. The exact meaning depends on how coordinates are encoded
    in the system, but typically represents a position or index within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for finding closest point
    code: int closestPoint = ObstacleUtils::ClosestPointOnLine(100, 50, 150); // Find
      closest point on line from 50 to 150 to point at 100
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger obstacle detection system used in
    TrinityCore for pathfinding and movement calculations. The integer-based parameters
    suggest that coordinates may be stored or represented as discrete values rather
    than floating-point numbers, which could impact precision in certain scenarios.
  warnings: Since this function operates on integer values, it may lose precision
    when dealing with fractional positions. Ensure that the coordinate system used
    is appropriate for your specific use case and consider potential rounding errors
    in calculations.
