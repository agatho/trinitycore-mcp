  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: IsMovingToDestination
  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::IsMovingToDestination(int * bot, const int & destination,
    float tolerance)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is currently moving toward a specified destination with optional
    tolerance.
  description: The IsMovingToDestination method determines whether a given bot is
    actively navigating toward a specific target location. It evaluates the bot's
    current movement state and compares it against the provided destination coordinates,
    taking into account a configurable tolerance threshold to account for minor positional
    discrepancies. This utility is commonly used in AI pathfinding logic to determine
    if a bot should continue moving or has reached its intended location. The method
    requires valid bot and destination parameters to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's identifier or data structure. Must be a valid
      reference to an active bot instance.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to the destination coordinate or position. Should represent
      a valid target location in the game world.
  - name: tolerance
    description: Floating-point value defining acceptable deviation from the exact
      destination. Higher values allow for greater positional flexibility before considering
      the bot as having arrived.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is actively moving toward the specified destination
    within the given tolerance, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (BotMovementUtil::IsMovingToDestination(&botId, destinationCoord, 0.5f))\
      \ {\n    // Bot is moving towards destination\n    printf(\"Bot is en route\
      \ to destination\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nfloat tolerance = 2.0f;\nconst int destCoord = 56789;\n\
      \nif (BotMovementUtil::IsMovingToDestination(&botId, destCoord, tolerance))\
      \ {\n    // Bot is moving towards destination with higher tolerance\n    //\
      \ Perform additional actions like updating UI or logging progress\n} else {\n\
      \    // Bot has likely reached or stopped moving toward destination\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot movement tracking and may not reflect
    real-time updates if called outside of a consistent game loop. The tolerance parameter
    allows for flexible arrival detection, which is especially useful when dealing
    with dynamic environments or network latency.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and destination parameters are valid before calling
    this function to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect handling of pointers or invalid
    coordinates can lead to crashes or incorrect return values.
