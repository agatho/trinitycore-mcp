  class: Unit
  method: SetAIAnimKitId
  signature: void Unit::SetAIAnimKitId(uint16 animKitId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the AI animation kit ID for the unit, controlling its combat animations
    and movement.
  description: This method assigns an AI animation kit ID to a Unit, which determines
    the specific animations and behaviors that will be used during combat and movement.
    The animation kit ID controls how the unit's AI interacts with the game world,
    including its stance, movement patterns, and combat animations. This is particularly
    useful for NPCs or creatures that need to display specific animation behaviors
    based on their AI configuration. The method affects the unit's visual representation
    and behavior in combat, but does not directly influence the actual AI logic or
    decision-making process.
  parameters:
  - name: animKitId
    description: The animation kit ID to assign to the unit. This value determines
      which animations will be used for the unit's AI behavior, including combat and
      movement. Valid values are typically in the range 0-65535, with 0 indicating
      no specific animation kit (default behavior). Values above 65535 may cause undefined
      behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetAIAnimKitId(1234);

      // This sets the animation kit ID to 1234 for the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    and should be called during initialization or when changing the unit's behavior.
    The animation kit ID must be properly configured in the game database to ensure
    correct behavior. This method affects visual animations but not actual AI decision-making
    logic.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect animations or visual
    artifacts. Setting invalid animation kit IDs may cause errors or unexpected behavior.
    Care should be taken when using this method with creatures that have specific
    AI behaviors, as it may override default animations.
