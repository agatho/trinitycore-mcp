documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session has failed to log in.
  description: The IsLoginFailed method determines if a bot session encountered an
    authentication failure during the login process. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to manage bot behavior and error handling when
    connecting to the game server. It returns true if the login attempt was unsuccessful,
    and false otherwise. The result can be used by the calling code to decide whether
    to retry the connection or take alternative actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session failed to log in, false if the login was
    successful or has not yet been attempted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check login status
    code: "if (botSession.IsLoginFailed()) {\n    // Handle failed login\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot login failed for session %u\", botSession.GetSessionId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotSession class which manages automated player
    sessions in TrinityCore. The implementation likely checks internal state flags
    or error codes set during authentication attempts.
