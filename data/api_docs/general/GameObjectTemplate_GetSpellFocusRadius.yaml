documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell focus radius of the game object template.
  description: The GetSpellFocusRadius method retrieves the radius within which players
    can interact with the game object for spell focusing purposes. This value is typically
    defined in the game object's database entry and determines the effective interaction
    range for certain spells or abilities that require a specific focus point. The
    returned value represents the radius in yards, used primarily for determining
    valid spell targeting zones around the game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell focus radius of the game object template
    in yards. This value defines the maximum distance from the object's center where
    players can successfully cast spells that require focusing on this object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);

      uint32 focusRadius = goTemplate->GetSpellFocusRadius();

      printf("Spell focus radius: %u yards\n", focusRadius);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell targeting logic to validate whether
    a player is within range of a game object that serves as a spell focus. The value
    returned should be interpreted as a radius from the object's center, not a diameter.
    Performance-wise, this is a simple getter method with no computational overhead.
