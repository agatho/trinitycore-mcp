  method: operator!=
  signature: bool CTROptions::operator!=(const CTROptions & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two CTROptions objects for inequality and returns true if they are
    not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this CTROptions
    instance and another CTROptions object to determine if they are not equivalent.
    It typically compares all member variables or relevant fields of the two objects
    to check for differences. This operator is commonly used in conditional statements
    or when storing objects in containers that require comparison operations. In the
    context of TrinityCore, CTROptions likely represents configuration options for
    some system or feature, and this method allows developers to efficiently determine
    if two option sets differ.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The CTROptions object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      is const-reference to avoid unnecessary copying and to ensure the comparison
      doesn't modify the right-hand operand.
  returns: Returns true if the two CTROptions objects are not equal, false otherwise.
    The comparison is typically performed by checking each member variable for equality,
    and if any difference is found, the method returns true immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: "CTROptions options1;\nCTROptions options2;\n// ... set some values in options1\
      \ and options2 ...\nif (options1 != options2) {\n    // Handle the case where\
      \ options are different\n    std::cout << \"Options are not equal\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in container operations
    code: "std::vector<CTROptions> optionList;\nCTROptions newOptions;\n// ... populate\
      \ optionList with various options ...\nif (std::find(optionList.begin(), optionList.end(),\
      \ newOptions) == optionList.end()) {\n    // newOptions not found in list, so\
      \ add it\n    optionList.push_back(newOptions);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is usually implemented as the logical negation of the equality
    operator (operator==). It's important that both operators are consistently implemented
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The performance of this method depends on how many
    member variables need to be compared, but typically it's a fast operation since
    it's often implemented using simple field-by-field comparisons.
