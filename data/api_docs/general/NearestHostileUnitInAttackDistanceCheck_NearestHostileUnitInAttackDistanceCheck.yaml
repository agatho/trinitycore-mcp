  class: NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck
  method: NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck
  signature: void NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck::NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck(const
    NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck
    class with values from another instance.
  description: The NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck constructor is used to
    create a new instance of this class by copying the state from an existing instance.
    This class is typically employed within TrinityCore's AI system to determine the
    nearest hostile unit that is within attack range of a given creature or player.
    The constructor performs a shallow copy of the provided parameter, ensuring that
    any references or pointers are duplicated correctly for proper AI behavior execution.
    It is commonly used in AI decision-making processes where units need to identify
    and prioritize targets based on proximity and attackability.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck instance to
      copy values from.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new instance by copying an existing one
    code: 'NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck originalCheck(...);

      NearestHostileUnitInAttackDistanceCheck newCheck(originalCheck);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the AI system and should
    not be called directly in most user scripts. The class likely implements a copy
    constructor pattern to maintain consistency of AI target selection logic across
    different AI contexts.
