  method: GetPitch
  signature: float Vehicle::GetPitch()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the pitch angle of the vehicle in radians.
  description: The GetPitch method retrieves the current pitch angle of the vehicle,
    which represents the rotation around the vehicle's X-axis. This value is typically
    used to determine the tilt or inclination of the vehicle relative to the horizontal
    plane. The returned value is expressed in radians and can be positive or negative,
    indicating upward or downward tilt respectively. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this method is commonly used for vehicle animation, physics calculations,
    and determining vehicle orientation during movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the pitch angle of the vehicle in radians. Positive
    values indicate upward tilt, negative values indicate downward tilt, and zero
    indicates a level orientation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    float pitch\
      \ = vehicle->GetPitch();\n    // Use pitch value for calculations or logging\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Vehicle pitch: %f radians\", pitch);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Tilt Detection
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    float pitch\
      \ = vehicle->GetPitch();\n    if (pitch > 0.5f)\n    {\n        // Vehicle is\
      \ tilted significantly upward\n        sLog->outString(\"Vehicle is pitching\
      \ up\");\n    }\n    else if (pitch < -0.5f)\n    {\n        // Vehicle is tilted\
      \ significantly downward\n        sLog->outString(\"Vehicle is pitching down\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: "The pitch value returned by this method reflects the vehicle's current orientation\
    \ in 3D space. It's important to note that this value may change dynamically during\
    \ vehicle movement, especially when the vehicle is accelerating, braking, or navigating\
    \ uneven terrain. The method does not perform any normalization of the angle values,\
    \ so results may exceed typical ranges (e.g., greater than 2\u03C0 or less than\
    \ -2\u03C0)."
  warnings: This method should only be called on vehicles that are currently mounted
    by a player or controlled by an AI. Calling GetPitch on a null vehicle pointer
    will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, pitch values may not accurately
    reflect the visual orientation of the vehicle model if the vehicle has custom
    animations or transformations applied.
