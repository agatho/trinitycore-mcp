documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Brewmaster's current stagger state is classified as
    heavy.
  description: The IsHeavyStagger method checks the current stagger status of a Brewmaster
    character and returns true if the stagger level is categorized as 'heavy'. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with the Brewmaster's stagger tracking
    system to determine appropriate spell casting or ability usage based on the severity
    of damage received. The method does not modify any internal state but provides
    a read-only view into the current stagger classification. It is commonly called
    during combat situations to assess when a Brewmaster should use abilities like
    Detox or Purify to remove harmful effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current stagger level is classified as heavy, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the Brewmaster has received sufficient damage to
    be in a critical stagger state requiring immediate attention.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "if (player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker()->IsHeavyStagger()) {\n    //\
      \ Use Detox or other heavy stagger mitigation abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DETOX, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Stagger State Before Ability Usage
    code: "BrewmasterStaggerTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker();\n\
      if (tracker && tracker->IsHeavyStagger()) {\n    // Heavy stagger detected,\
      \ apply appropriate mitigation\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_PURIFY,\
      \ true);\n} else if (tracker && tracker->IsMediumStagger()) {\n    // Medium\
      \ stagger handling\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_SERENITY, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal stagger tracking system which updates
    based on incoming damage and the character's current stagger levels. The implementation
    may be affected by the Brewmaster's talent tree and abilities that modify stagger
    behavior. Ensure that the BrewmasterStaggerTracker instance is valid before calling
    this method to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a Brewmaster character is actively
    in combat or has recently taken damage, as the stagger state may not be properly
    initialized otherwise. Calling this method on a non-Brewmaster class will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes if the tracker is not properly implemented
    for that class.
