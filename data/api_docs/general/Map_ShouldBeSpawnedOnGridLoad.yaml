    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific spawn type should be spawned during grid loading.
  description: This method checks if a particular spawn type (such as creatures or
    GameObject) should be spawned when the grid is loaded. It evaluates the spawn
    conditions based on the spawn type and ID, returning true if the spawn should
    occur during grid initialization. The method is primarily used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to control which objects are loaded
    with the grid during map loading operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spawn type should be spawned on grid load,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the spawn object will be included in the
    grid's initial loading process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool shouldSpawn = map->ShouldBeSpawnedOnGridLoad(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE,\
      \ 12345);\nif (shouldSpawn) {\n    // Spawn creature with ID 12345 on grid load\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    grid loading operations. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    spawn objects, but rather determines whether they should be included in the spawning
    process when the grid loads.
  warnings: This method should only be called during grid loading operations. Calling
    it outside of proper context may lead to incorrect behavior or errors in object
    spawning.
