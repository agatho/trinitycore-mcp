documentation:
  brief: Creates a private scene object associated with the spell effect for the caster's
    client.
  description: The EffectCreatePrivateSceneObject method is responsible for generating
    and displaying a private scene object within the game world, typically used in
    conjunction with spell effects that require visual or spatial components. This
    method ensures that only the caster (or specific targets) can see the created
    scene object, making it useful for localized visual effects such as custom spell
    animations, environmental changes, or temporary object placements. It operates
    under the context of a spell's effect execution and is usually invoked during
    the spell's processing phase. The scene object is managed by the server and rendered
    client-side for appropriate players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect handler
    code: "void Spell::EffectCreatePrivateSceneObject()\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ creates a private scene object\n    // associated with the current spell and\
      \ caster\n    if (Unit* caster = GetCaster())\n    {\n        // Trigger client-side\
      \ scene object creation\n        caster->SendPrivateSceneObject();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during effect
    processing. Developers should ensure that any associated scene data is properly
    initialized before calling this method, as incorrect setup may result in visual
    artifacts or client-side errors. The object's lifetime is tied to the spell's
    duration and the caster's validity.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper scene initialization can cause
    client crashes or visual inconsistencies. Ensure that the spell effect is correctly
    configured for private scenes, as not all spells support this functionality.
