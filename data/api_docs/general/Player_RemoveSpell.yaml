    bool suppressMessaging)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a spell from the player's spell book.
  description: The RemoveSpell method removes a specified spell from the player's
    spell book, effectively unlearning the spell and making it unavailable for use.
    This method is commonly used in game mechanics to handle spell removals during
    quest completion, character level-ups, or when applying certain buffs/ debuffs.
    The method can optionally disable the spell in the spell book, learn lower rank
    versions, or suppress messaging related to the removal.
  parameters:
  - name: spell_id
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be removed. This is typically
      a value from the spell database or a spell ID used in game mechanics.
  - name: disabled
    description: When set to true, prevents the spell from being re-enabled later.
      This is useful for temporary removals that should not be reversible.
  - name: learn_low_rank
    description: If true, allows the player to learn lower rank versions of the spell
      after removal. This is commonly used when removing higher rank spells to maintain
      progression in spell learning.
  - name: suppressMessaging
    description: When set to true, prevents any messaging related to the spell removal
      from being displayed to the player. This is useful for avoiding spam during
      automated spell removals.
  returns: null

    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Removal with Options
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and interacts with the spell book
    system. It should be used carefully as removing a spell may affect gameplay progression
    or quest completion. The method is typically called during game events or when
    applying specific mechanics like spell removals.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell removals, affecting
    player progression and quest completion. Be cautious with the disabled parameter
    as it may prevent relearning of spells in some cases. Also, ensure that the spell_id
    exists in the database before calling this method.
