  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: IsEventViable
  signature: bool GuildEventCoordinator::IsEventViable(const GuildEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a guild event is viable for execution based on current
    game state and conditions.
  description: The IsEventViable method evaluates if a given guild event can be executed
    successfully at the current time. It checks various prerequisites such as player
    availability, resource requirements, and game mechanics constraints that must
    be met for the event to proceed. This method is typically called before attempting
    to start or process a guild event to ensure all conditions are satisfied. The
    evaluation considers factors like active participants, cooldown periods, and any
    required in-game items or currency. It serves as a validation step to prevent
    invalid or impossible events from being initiated.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: Reference to the GuildEvent object that needs to be evaluated for
      viability. This parameter contains all necessary information about the event
      including its type, required resources, and conditions.
  returns: Returns true if the guild event meets all necessary conditions and can
    be executed successfully; returns false otherwise. A return value of false indicates
    that at least one prerequisite or constraint has not been satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic viability check for a guild event
    code: "GuildEvent myEvent;\n// ... initialize event ...\nif (guildEventCoordinator.IsEventViable(myEvent))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with event execution\n    guildEventCoordinator.StartEvent(myEvent);\n\
      } else {\n    // Event cannot be executed\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Event is not\
      \ currently viable.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using viability check in event scheduling system
    code: "void ScheduleGuildEvent(GuildEvent& event) {\n    if (guildEventCoordinator.IsEventViable(event))\
      \ {\n        // Event is viable, schedule it\n        event.SetScheduledTime(GetNextAvailableTime());\n\
      \        AddToEventQueue(event);\n        SendNotification(\"Event scheduled\
      \ successfully.\");\n    } else {\n        // Check which condition failed and\
      \ notify user\n        if (!event.HasRequiredPlayers()) {\n            SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough players available for this event.\");\n        } else if (event.IsOnCooldown())\
      \ {\n            SendNotification(\"This event is currently on cooldown.\");\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs checks that may involve database queries or complex game
    state evaluations, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    sections. The implementation likely caches certain values to improve performance
    for repeated checks on the same event type.
  warnings: This method does not modify the event state or perform any side effects;
    it only evaluates conditions. Be aware that an event marked as viable may still
    fail during actual execution due to dynamic game conditions that change between
    viability check and execution time.
