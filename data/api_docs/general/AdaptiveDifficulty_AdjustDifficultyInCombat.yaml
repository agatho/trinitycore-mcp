  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: AdjustDifficultyInCombat
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustDifficultyInCombat(BotAI * bot, Player
    * opponent)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the difficulty level for a bot AI during combat based on opponent
    characteristics.
  description: The AdjustDifficultyInCombat method modifies the adaptive difficulty
    settings for a bot AI instance while in combat, dynamically adjusting the challenge
    level based on the opponent's attributes. This method is typically invoked when
    a bot enters combat with a player or creature to ensure that the encounter remains
    appropriately challenging. The adjustment considers factors such as the opponent's
    level, health, and other relevant combat statistics to modify the bot's behavior,
    decision-making, and difficulty scaling. It ensures that bots maintain a balanced
    and engaging experience for players without being overly simplistic or excessively
    difficult.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose difficulty settings will be adjusted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: opponent
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the opponent in combat.
      Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: "void OnCombatStart(BotAI* bot, Player* opponent)\n{\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustDifficultyInCombat(bot,\
      \ opponent);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with difficulty scaling logic
    code: "void HandleCombatUpdate(BotAI* bot, Player* opponent)\n{\n    if (opponent->GetLevel()\
      \ > bot->GetPlayer()->GetLevel() + 5)\n    {\n        AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustDifficultyInCombat(bot,\
      \ opponent);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive difficulty system designed to enhance
    gameplay balance in TrinityCore. It should be called only during active combat
    situations where both bot and opponent are valid objects. The implementation may
    internally use player level differences, health ratios, or other metrics to determine
    how to adjust the bot's behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'opponent' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method; passing null values could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method modifies internal AI state, so it should not be called outside of
    combat contexts unless carefully managed.
