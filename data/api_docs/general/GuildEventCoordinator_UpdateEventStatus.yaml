documentation:
  brief: Updates the status of a guild event with the specified event ID to the new
    status value.
  description: The UpdateEventStatus method is used to modify the current status of
    a specific guild event within the TrinityCore framework. This function allows
    administrators or system processes to change the state of an event, such as transitioning
    it from 'pending' to 'active', 'completed', or 'cancelled'. The method takes a
    unique event identifier and a new status value, updating the internal event tracking
    system accordingly. This functionality is crucial for managing guild activities,
    raids, and other time-sensitive events within the game world. The update operation
    typically involves validating the provided event ID exists and that the new status
    is a valid state for the event type.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier for the guild event to be updated. This value
      must correspond to an existing event in the system, otherwise the operation
      may fail or have no effect.
  - name: newStatus
    description: The new status value to assign to the event. This should be a valid
      enum or integer representing a recognized event state such as pending, active,
      completed, or cancelled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a guild raid event status
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventStatus(12345, EVENT_STATUS_ACTIVE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cancel an ongoing guild event
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 raidId = sGuildEventManager->GetLastRaidEventId();

      coordinator.UpdateEventStatus(raidId, EVENT_STATUS_CANCELLED);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal event state change handlers and may
    broadcast updates to connected guild members. The implementation should ensure
    thread safety when modifying shared event data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId may result in undefined behavior
    or silently fail. Ensure that the newStatus parameter is within the expected range
    of valid event states for the system.
