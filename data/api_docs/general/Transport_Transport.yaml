  method: Transport
  signature: void Transport::Transport()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new transport instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The Transport constructor initializes a new transport object, setting
    up its internal state and preparing it to function as a moving platform within
    the World of Warcraft environment. This method is responsible for initializing
    core transport properties such as position, orientation, movement data, and associated
    passenger information. It ensures that the transport is properly registered with
    the game world's transport system and ready to handle passengers and movement
    updates. The constructor also sets up necessary internal data structures required
    for maintaining the transport's state during runtime, including handling of waypoints,
    speed calculations, and synchronization with client-side expectations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Transport Instance
    code: 'Transport* myTransport = new Transport();

      // The transport is now initialized and ready for use

      myTransport->SetPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      myTransport->StartMovement();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new transport object
    from scratch. It does not handle loading from database or existing transport states.
    The transport must be properly registered with the world manager after construction
    to ensure it functions correctly in the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on existing transport objects as
    it will reset all internal state. Always use proper factory methods or object
    creation patterns when working with transports in TrinityCore.
