  class: Quest
  method: GetNextQuestInChain
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetNextQuestInChain() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the next quest in the chain.
  description: The GetNextQuestInChain method retrieves the quest ID of the next quest
    in the sequential chain following the current quest. This method is commonly used
    in quest scripting and quest progression logic to determine what quest should
    be triggered next after completing the current one. It typically returns a value
    that corresponds to the next quest in the quest chain, which may be zero if no
    further quests exist in the chain. The method is essential for managing quest
    progression and ensuring proper quest completion sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the quest ID of the next quest in the chain, or 0 if no subsequent
    quest exists. This value represents a unique identifier that corresponds to the
    next quest in the quest chain sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Chain Retrieval
    code: "uint32 nextQuestId = quest->GetNextQuestInChain();\nif (nextQuestId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with next quest\n    Quest::QuestLogEntry entry = quest->GetQuestLogEntry();\n\
      \    // Process next quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard quest progression system and should be
    used carefully when implementing quest logic. It's typically called during quest
    completion or when handling quest rewards to determine what quest comes next in
    the sequence.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in quest scripts as it may return zero
    if no further quests exist, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled
    properly. Also note that this method should be used with care in multi-threaded
    environments where quest progression might be modified by other threads.
