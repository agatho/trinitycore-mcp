documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Strategy object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~Strategy destructor is called automatically when a Strategy object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the strategy instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, strategies are used to define behavior
    patterns for NPCs, and their destruction is critical for preventing memory leaks.
    The destructor typically handles cleanup of internal data structures, such as
    action lists, condition checks, or references to other AI components that may
    have been allocated during the strategy's lifetime.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Strategy object
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    Strategy* strategy = new Strategy();\n    //\
      \ ... use strategy ...\n    delete strategy; // Triggers ~Strategy destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated Strategy destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction() {\n    Strategy strategy; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use strategy ...\n    // ~Strategy called automatically when going\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base Strategy class, allowing
    proper cleanup of derived strategy types. It's important to ensure that no other
    objects hold references to this strategy after destruction, as accessing freed
    memory can lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless you are implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor should only be invoked by the C++ runtime during
    object destruction or via delete operator.
