    guid)
documentation:
  brief: Writes a player's dump data to a string buffer for storage or transmission
  description: The WriteDumpToString method serializes a player's character data into
    a formatted string representation. This functionality is typically used for exporting
    character information, saving character states, or transferring player data between
    systems. The method takes a GUID parameter to identify which player's data should
    be serialized and returns a DumpReturn enum indicating success or failure of the
    operation. The resulting dump string contains structured data about the player
    including their attributes, inventory, skills, and other relevant game state information.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose data should be dumped
      to string format. This must be a valid player GUID that exists in the database.
  returns: DumpReturn enum value indicating the result of the dump operation. Possible
    values include DUMP_SUCCESS for successful serialization, DUMP_NOT_FOUND if no
    player with the given GUID exists, and DUMP_ERROR for internal processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to export player data
    code: "std::string dumpData;\nPlayerDumpWriter writer;\nDumpReturn result = writer.WriteDumpToString(dumpData,\
      \ 12345);\nif (result == DUMP_SUCCESS) {\n    // Successfully exported player\
      \ data\n    std::cout << \"Player dump: \" << dumpData << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to export player dump\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant database queries and data serialization
    operations, so it should not be called frequently in performance-critical code
    paths. The returned string format is typically structured for easy parsing and
    storage in external systems or databases.
  warnings: The method assumes the player with the specified GUID exists in the system.
    Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in DUMP_NOT_FOUND
    or undefined behavior. Ensure proper error handling when using this method in
    production code.
