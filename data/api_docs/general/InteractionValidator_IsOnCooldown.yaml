    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently on cooldown for a specified interaction type
  description: The IsOnCooldown method determines whether a given player character
    is currently under a cooldown period for a specific type of interaction. This
    is commonly used in AI behavior systems to prevent players from repeatedly performing
    the same action too quickly. The method evaluates the player's current state and
    any active cooldown timers associated with the specified interaction type. It
    returns true if the player cannot perform the interaction due to an active cooldown,
    and false if the interaction is available for use.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character being checked
      for cooldown status
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of interaction to check for
      cooldown. This typically represents different actions like spell casting, item
      usage, or ability activation
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the player is currently on cooldown for
    the specified interaction type. Returns true if cooldown is active, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown check for a player
    code: "if (validator.IsOnCooldown(player, InteractionType::SPELL_CAST)) {\n  \
      \  // Player cannot cast spells right now\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with spell\
      \ casting logic"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cooldown check in AI decision making
    code: "bool canInteract = !validator.IsOnCooldown(bot, InteractionType::ITEM_USE);\n\
      if (canInteract) {\n    // Bot can use item\n    bot->UseItem(itemGuid);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Bot should wait or try another action\n    bot->SetNextAction(ActionType::WAIT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal cooldown tracking systems within TrinityCore's
    player management. The exact cooldown duration and reset behavior depends on the
    specific interaction type and game mechanics. This check should be performed before
    attempting any interaction to prevent invalid actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Incorrect handling of null pointers may lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that cooldowns might be affected by various game effects like haste
    buffs or debuffs.
