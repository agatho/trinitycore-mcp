  method: GetBackstabPosition
  signature: int MeleePositionStrategy::GetBackstabPosition(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal backstab position relative to the target
    unit for a melee attacker.
  description: The GetBackstabPosition method determines the appropriate positioning
    strategy for a rogue or similar class character to execute a backstab attack.
    This method evaluates the angle between the attacking unit and its target, considering
    the target's orientation and the attacker's current facing direction. It returns
    an integer value that represents the calculated backstab position, which typically
    indicates whether the attacker is positioned correctly behind the target for maximum
    damage potential. The method is used in AI decision-making processes to optimize
    combat positioning during melee engagements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated backstab position. A positive
    value typically indicates a favorable backstab position, while negative values
    may suggest suboptimal positioning or that a backstab cannot be executed at this
    time. The exact meaning of specific values depends on internal implementation
    logic and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "int position = strategy.GetBackstabPosition(targetUnit);\nif (position\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Proceed with backstab attack\n    attacker->CastSpell(targetUnit,\
      \ BACKSTAB_SPELL_ID, true);\n} else {\n    // Move to better position or use\
      \ alternative attack\n    attacker->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on angle calculations between the attacker and
    target units. The implementation may consider factors such as target's facing
    direction, attacker's current orientation, and combat range thresholds. Performance-wise,
    this method should be lightweight as it's called frequently during AI processing.
  warnings: The return value interpretation might vary based on internal game mechanics
    and could change with different class behaviors or updates. Ensure proper handling
    of negative return values to avoid incorrect attack decisions.
