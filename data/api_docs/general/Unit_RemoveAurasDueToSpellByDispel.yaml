documentation:
  brief: Removes auras caused by a specific spell due to dispel mechanics.
  description: This method removes all auras that were applied by a specified spell,
    typically used in dispel mechanics where a spell is removed from a target based
    on the caster's influence. The method handles removal of auras based on the dispeller
    spell ID and caster GUID, with optional charge removal. It is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft mechanics for handling dispel effects, such as removing beneficial
    or harmful spells from targets during combat.

  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID that caused the aura to be applied on the target
  - name: dispellerSpellId
    description: The spell ID used to determine the dispel effect, typically a spell
      that triggers the removal of the aura
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster who applied the aura, used to determine which
      aura to remove
  - name: dispeller
    description: Pointer to the dispeller spell ID, used for additional filtering
      or removal logic

    description: Number of charges to be removed from the aura, if applicable
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      Unit* caster = GetCaster();

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      uint32 dispellerSpellId = 67890;

      int casterGUID = caster->GetGUID();

      int* dispeller = nullptr;

      uint8 chargesRemoved = 1;


      target->RemoveAurasDueToSpellByDispel(spellId, dispellerSpellId, casterGUID,
      dispeller, chargesRemoved);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is used in the context of spell mechanics and combat system.
    It requires careful handling of GUIDs and spell IDs to ensure correct removal
    of auras. The method may be used for both beneficial and harmful effects depending
    on the context of the spell being removed.
  warnings: The method may not work correctly if the spell ID or caster GUID is invalid
    or not properly initialized, leading to incorrect aura removal or no removal at
    all. Ensure that the spell IDs are valid before calling this method.
