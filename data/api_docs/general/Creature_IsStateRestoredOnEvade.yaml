  method: IsStateRestoredOnEvade
  signature: bool Creature::IsStateRestoredOnEvade() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature's state is restored after evading.
  description: This method checks if a creature's state is restored upon evading,
    which typically occurs when a creature returns to its original position or state
    after being engaged in combat and then fleeing. The method is used to determine
    if the creature has properly returned to its initial state following an evade
    action, particularly relevant for creatures that have specific behaviors related
    to their positioning and state management during combat. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics and ensuring that creatures behave
    correctly when they evade.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature's state is restored after evading, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature has successfully returned to its
    original state following an evade action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsStateRestoredOnEvade()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other state management
    functions to ensure that creatures properly return to their original positions
    after evading. It may be used in combat-related logic or during AI behavior implementation.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in combat situations without proper
    understanding of the creature's behavior and state management. Misuse can lead
    to incorrect behavior or game mechanics issues.
