documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the difficulty changed handler.
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the string identifier associated
    with this DifficultyChangedHandler instance. This name is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to uniquely identify different handler implementations
    within the difficulty change system. The method provides a consistent way to access
    the handler's name without exposing internal implementation details. It is commonly
    used for logging, debugging, or identifying specific handlers during runtime operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of this DifficultyChangedHandler
    instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DifficultyChangedHandler handler;

      std::string name = handler.GetHandlerName();

      // Returns the string identifier for this handler'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be a constant time operation as it typically returns
    a cached or pre-computed string value. The returned string should remain consistent
    throughout the lifetime of the handler instance.
