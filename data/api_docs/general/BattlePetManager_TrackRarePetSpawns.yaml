  class: BattlePetManager
  method: TrackRarePetSpawns
  signature: void BattlePetManager::TrackRarePetSpawns(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks rare pet spawns for the specified player.
  description: The TrackRarePetSpawns method monitors and records instances when rare
    battle pets spawn within the game world for a given player. This functionality
    is typically used to track player progress, achievements, or quest requirements
    related to encountering rare creatures. The method likely updates internal tracking
    structures or logs to maintain a record of these events. It may be invoked automatically
    by the game engine upon pet spawns or manually by external systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's rare pet spawn events should
      be tracked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of TrackRarePetSpawns
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      BattlePetManager* manager = BattlePetManager::GetSingleton();

      manager->TrackRarePetSpawns(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages battle pet encounters
    and tracking. It may interact with database systems or event handlers to persist
    spawn data. The implementation might include thread safety considerations if called
    from multiple contexts.
  warnings: Ensure the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active player
    session, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method should not be called with
    null pointers.
