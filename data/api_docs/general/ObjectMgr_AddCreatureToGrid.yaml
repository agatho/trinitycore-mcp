  signature: void ObjectMgr::AddCreatureToGrid(const int * data)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a creature to the grid system for spatial partitioning and visibility
    management.
  description: The AddCreatureToGrid method integrates a creature into the game world's
    grid-based spatial indexing system. This allows the server to efficiently manage
    which creatures are visible to players within their respective grids, improving
    performance by reducing unnecessary object updates. The method takes an array
    of data representing the creature's position and grid coordinates, ensuring that
    the creature is properly placed in the appropriate grid cells for visibility calculations
    and NPC behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: An array of integers containing creature data including position
      coordinates (x, y, z) and grid coordinates (grid_x, grid_y). The exact structure
      depends on internal TrinityCore conventions but typically includes at least
      the creature's location in world space and its associated grid cell indices.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a creature to grid using pre-defined data
    code: 'int creatureData[] = {100, 200, 300, 5, 6}; // x, y, z, grid_x, grid_y

      ObjectMgr::instance()->AddCreatureToGrid(creatureData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when creatures are
    spawned or moved between grids. It's crucial for maintaining proper visibility
    and performance in large-scale world environments. The method assumes that the
    provided data is valid and within expected ranges.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted data or out-of-bounds grid coordinates can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. This method should not be called directly with
    invalid parameters without prior validation.
