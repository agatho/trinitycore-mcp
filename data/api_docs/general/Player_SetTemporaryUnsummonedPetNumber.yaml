    temporarily unsummoned from the player's control. It is used primarily during
    pet management operations, such as when a pet is dismissed or summoned back into

    pet's state in relation to summoning and unsummoning events.

      pet. This value represents a specific pet instance that has been removed from

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet management functions
    and should be called when a pet is temporarily removed from the player's control.
    It does not affect the actual pet's summoning state but rather tracks the pet's
    identifier for future reference.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet tracking, potentially
    causing issues with pet summoning or removal in game. Care should be taken when
    calling this method during pet-related events.
