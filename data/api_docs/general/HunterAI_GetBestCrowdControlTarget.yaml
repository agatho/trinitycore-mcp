api:
  class: HunterAI
  method: GetBestCrowdControlTarget
  signature: int * HunterAI::GetBestCrowdControlTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the most suitable target for applying crowd control effects.
  description: The GetBestCrowdControlTarget method identifies and returns the optimal
    enemy target within the hunter's current threat range that is eligible for crowd
    control abilities. This method evaluates potential targets based on factors such
    as threat level, distance, and whether the target is currently under a crowd control
    effect. The returned value represents the unique identifier (GUID) of the selected
    target, which can be used to apply or check the status of crowd control spells.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining effective combat strategy in group
    scenarios where controlling enemy movement and positioning is essential.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best target for crowd
    control application, or nullptr if no suitable target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = hunterAI->GetBestCrowdControlTarget()) {\n    //\
      \ Apply crowd control spell to the target\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *targetGuid);\n    if (target) {\n        // Cast crowd control ability on\
      \ target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Validity
    code: "int* ccTarget = hunterAI->GetBestCrowdControlTarget();\nif (ccTarget &&\
      \ *ccTarget != 0) {\n    // Proceed with crowd control logic\n    Unit* target\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *ccTarget);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive()\
      \ && !target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_STUN)) {\n        // Safe to apply\
      \ crowd control\n    }\n} else {\n    // No valid target found\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used by the AI system to determine optimal targets
    for abilities like Fear, Scatter Shot, or other crowd control spells. The selection
    process considers current threat, distance, and target eligibility. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called sparingly during combat updates to avoid excessive
    processing overhead.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no suitable target is found, so always
    check for null before dereferencing. Also, ensure that the target GUID remains
    valid when using it later in the code, as targets can die or become invalid between
    calls.
