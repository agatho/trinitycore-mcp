documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the ticket object
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a ticket instance. In the context of TrinityCore's ticketing system, this
    identifier is used to uniquely identify and reference specific tickets within
    the database and game systems. The returned ID typically corresponds to the primary
    key in the ticket database table. This method is commonly used when interacting
    with ticket management systems, logging, or when referencing specific tickets
    in other game mechanics such as ticket resolution or player communication.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier of the ticket. This
    ID is typically a positive integer that serves as the primary key for the ticket
    record in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic ticket ID retrieval
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketById(12345);\nif (ticket)\n{\n  \
      \  int ticketId = ticket->GetId();\n    printf(\"Ticket ID: %d\\n\", ticketId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ticket ID in database operations
    code: "void HandleTicketCommand(ChatHandler* handler, uint32 ticketId)\n{\n  \
      \  Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketById(ticketId);\n    if (ticket)\n\
      \    {\n        int id = ticket->GetId();\n        // Use the ID for database\
      \ operations or logging\n        LOG_INFO(\"ticket\", \"Processing ticket with\
      \ ID: {}\", id);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the ticket object's
    state. The returned ID should be treated as immutable and should not be used to
    directly manipulate the ticket data in the database without proper validation.
    This method assumes that the ticket has been properly initialized with a valid
    ID.
  warnings: Ensure that the ticket object is valid before calling GetId() to avoid
    undefined behavior. While the method itself is safe, calling it on an uninitialized
    or destroyed ticket object may result in unpredictable return values.
