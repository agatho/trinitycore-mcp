  class: Player
  method: isTaxiCheater
  signature: bool Player::isTaxiCheater() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has enabled the taxi cheater feature.
  description: The isTaxiCheater method checks if a player has activated the taxi
    cheater cheat mode, which allows them to bypass normal flight path restrictions
    and travel without requiring the proper flight paths or quest requirements. This
    method is commonly used in debugging and testing scenarios where developers need
    to verify player behavior or check for cheating. The feature typically enables
    players to use any available flight path regardless of their current quest progress
    or faction requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has enabled the taxi cheater mode, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player can bypass normal flight path restrictions and
    travel freely through the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->isTaxiCheater()) {\n    // Player can use any flight path\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for debugging purposes and should not be used
    in production code. The implementation likely checks internal player flags or
    state that indicate whether the taxi cheater mode is active. Performance impact
    is minimal as it simply checks a boolean flag.
  warnings: Using this method in production code may cause unexpected behavior if
    players are not properly flagged as cheaters. This method should only be used
    in development environments or when testing specific game mechanics.
