  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: SetNumBids
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::SetNumBids(int numBids)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of bids for a black market item entry.
  description: The SetNumBids method updates the bid count associated with a specific
    black market item entry. This method is typically used within the context of World
    of Warcraft's black market auction system, where players can place bids on items.
    The number of bids reflects how many times a particular item has been bid upon.
    This value is often synchronized with the game's auction house mechanics and may
    affect the item's final sale price or auction duration.
  parameters:
  - name: numBids
    description: The new number of bids to assign to the black market entry. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the count of bids placed on this item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Bid Count for a Black Market Item
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);

      entry->SetNumBids(5); // Sets the bid count to 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the BlackMarketEntry object.
    It is recommended to validate input values before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior in auction mechanics.
  warnings: Modifying the number of bids directly may interfere with normal auction
    flow and could lead to inconsistencies if not properly synchronized with other
    systems like bid tracking or item ownership.
