documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the status of the warlock's pet during AI update cycles.
  description: The UpdatePetCheck method is responsible for evaluating the current
    state of a warlock's summoned pet within the AI system. It performs checks to
    determine if the pet needs to be resurrected, re-summoned, or if its behavior
    should be adjusted based on the warlock's current situation. This method is typically
    called during the AI update loop to ensure that the pet remains active and functional
    in combat scenarios. The implementation may consider factors such as pet health,
    summoning state, and the warlock's own condition to make decisions about pet management.

      \ ...\n    UpdatePetCheck();\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should be called regularly
    to maintain pet functionality. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    warlock class specialization or server configuration.
