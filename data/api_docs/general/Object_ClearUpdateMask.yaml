api:
  class: Object
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void Object::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the object's update mask, optionally removing it from the update queue
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of an Object
    instance, which is used by the TrinityCore server to track which fields of the
    object have been modified and need to be sent to clients. When remove is set to
    true, the object is also removed from the update queue, preventing further updates
    from being sent to players. This method is typically called during object destruction
    or when resetting an object's state to ensure clean synchronization with the client.
    The update mask is crucial for network efficiency as it prevents sending unnecessary
    data to clients.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, removes the object from the update queue in addition to
      clearing the mask. If false, only clears the update mask without removing from
      the queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to clear update mask
    code: 'Object* obj = ...;

      obj->ClearUpdateMask(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear update mask and remove from queue
    code: 'Object* obj = ...;

      obj->ClearUpdateMask(true); // Removes object from update queue'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine during object
    cleanup or state changes. It's important to understand that clearing the update
    mask without removing from the queue may lead to stale data being sent to clients
    if the object remains in the update system.
  warnings: Calling this method on objects still in use can cause synchronization
    issues with players. Ensure proper object lifecycle management before calling
    ClearUpdateMask with remove=true.
