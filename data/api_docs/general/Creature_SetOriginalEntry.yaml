  class: Creature
  method: SetOriginalEntry
  signature: void Creature::SetOriginalEntry(uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the original entry ID of a creature, preserving its initial template
    configuration.
  description: This method allows developers to change the original entry ID of a
    creature object, which is crucial for maintaining the creature's template information
    when its entry is modified during runtime. The original entry ID represents the
    base creature template that was used to spawn the creature, and this method ensures
    that the original template information is preserved even after modifications.
    This functionality is particularly important in scenarios where creatures are
    dynamically modified through scripting or game mechanics, such as in quest completion
    or NPC interaction changes. The method does not affect the current entry ID but
    rather stores the original entry for reference purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The new original entry ID to set for the creature. This value represents
      the base template entry that was used to create the creature, and must be a
      valid creature entry from the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Original Entry
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetOriginalEntry(12345);

      // The creature now has its original entry set to 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Preserving Template Information
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      uint32 originalEntry = creature->GetOriginalEntry();

      creature->SetOriginalEntry(54321);

      // Original entry remains 12345, but current entry is now 54321'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the creature's template
    information. It is recommended to use this method when modifying creature entries
    during runtime to ensure that the original template data is preserved for future
    reference or restoration.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect template information
    being stored, which could cause issues with creature behavior or quest completion.
    Always ensure that the entry value passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    creature template in the database.
