documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the map contains any player entities.
  description: The HavePlayers() method determines if there are any active player
    characters present on the map. This is a crucial utility function used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to manage player-related operations, such as updating
    player states, handling player events, and determining when certain map-based
    systems should be active. The method performs a quick check against the internal
    player list for the map and returns true if at least one player exists, false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for efficient resource management and
    ensures that map-specific logic only runs when necessary.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are any players currently on the map; returns false
    if no players are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Presence
    code: "if (map->HavePlayers()) {\n    // Perform actions that require players\
      \ to be present\n    map->UpdatePlayers();\n} else {\n    // Handle case when\
      \ no players are on the map\n    map->ClearInactiveObjects();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Map Update Logic
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    if (HavePlayers()) {\n        // Update\
      \ player-dependent systems\n        UpdatePlayerSystems(diff);\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Update only non-player systems\n        UpdateNonPlayerSystems(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the code
    where unnecessary processing should be avoided when no players are present. The
    implementation likely uses an optimized internal data structure to quickly determine
    player presence without iterating through all objects on the map.
