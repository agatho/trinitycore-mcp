documentation:
  brief: Sets the next level experience value for the pet.
  description: The SetPetNextLevelExperience method updates the amount of experience
    required for the pet to reach its next level. This method is typically used during
    pet leveling processes or when adjusting pet progression in game mechanics. The
    provided experience value determines how much more experience the pet needs before
    it can level up. This method does not trigger any level-up logic directly; it
    only sets the target experience threshold. It's commonly called internally by
    the core when pets gain experience or when modifying pet behavior through game
    scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The next level experience value to set for the pet. This should be
      a positive integer representing the amount of experience points required for
      the pet to level up.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Next Level Experience for a Pet
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->SetPetNextLevelExperience(1000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Pet Experience Based on Level
    code: "Pet* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet)\n{\n    uint32 nextLevelXP = pet->GetLevel()\
      \ * 500;\n    pet->SetPetNextLevelExperience(nextLevelXP);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal experience tracking of the pet.
    It should be used carefully as it bypasses normal experience gain mechanics. The
    value set here will be used by the core's level-up system when the pet accumulates
    enough experience.
  warnings: Modifying next level experience values manually may cause unexpected behavior
    if not aligned with the expected progression curve. Ensure that the XP value is
    appropriate for the pet's current level to avoid issues with level progression
    or experience display.
