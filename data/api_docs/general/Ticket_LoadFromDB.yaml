documentation:
  brief: Loads ticket data from the database into the Ticket object's member variables.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes a Ticket object's internal state
    by extracting data from a database row represented by the Field array parameter.
    This method is typically invoked during the ticket creation process when a ticket
    record is fetched from the database, ensuring that all relevant ticket information
    such as ticket ID, player GUID, message content, and status are correctly populated
    within the object instance. It serves as part of the object-relational mapping
    mechanism for ticket records in TrinityCore's ticketing system.

  examples:
  - title: Loading a Ticket from Database Query Result
    code: "QueryResult result = LoginDatabase.Query(\"SELECT id, player_guid, message,\
      \ created_time FROM gm_tickets WHERE id = 123\");\nif (result)\n{\n    Field*\
      \ fields = result->Fetch();\n    Ticket ticket;\n    ticket.LoadFromDB(fields);\n\
      \    // Ticket is now populated with data from the database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Field array contains valid data in the correct
    order matching the expected column structure of the gm_tickets table. It's typically
    called internally by the Ticket constructor or factory methods, not directly by
    user code.
