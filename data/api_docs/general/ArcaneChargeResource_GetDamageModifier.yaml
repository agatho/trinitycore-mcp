  class: ArcaneChargeResource
  method: GetDamageModifier
  signature: float ArcaneChargeResource::GetDamageModifier() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage modifier applied by arcane charge resources.
  description: The GetDamageModifier method retrieves the current damage multiplier
    that is applied to spell or attack damage based on the arcane charge resource
    state. This value typically reflects how many charges are currently active and
    their contribution to increasing damage output. The method is commonly used in
    spell processing or combat calculations where arcane magic effects scale with
    resource accumulation. It does not modify internal state but returns a computed
    floating-point value representing the cumulative damage boost.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current damage modifier. This value is typically
    greater than or equal to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates no additional damage bonus from
    arcane charges, and values above 1.0 indicate increasing damage based on active
    arcane charge levels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Processing
    code: 'float modifier = player->GetArcaneChargeResource()->GetDamageModifier();

      float finalDamage = baseDamage * modifier;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Modifier to Damage Calculation
    code: "if (player->HasArcaneChargeResource()) {\n    float damageMod = player->GetArcaneChargeResource()->GetDamageModifier();\n\
      \    spellInfo->damage *= damageMod;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat calculations to ensure
    up-to-date damage modifiers. The returned value may vary depending on the number
    of arcane charges accumulated and their individual contribution to damage scaling.
  warnings: Ensure that the ArcaneChargeResource object is valid before calling this
    method, as accessing a null resource can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
