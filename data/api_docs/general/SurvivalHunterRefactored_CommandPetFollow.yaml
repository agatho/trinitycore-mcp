  method: CommandPetFollow
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::CommandPetFollow()
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to follow the hunter.
  description: The CommandPetFollow method instructs the hunter's current pet to begin
    following the hunter. This method is typically invoked when the hunter issues
    a 'follow' command through the game interface or via AI logic. It adjusts the
    pet's movement behavior to maintain proximity to the hunter, ensuring that the
    pet remains within a specified distance and does not wander off. The implementation
    likely involves setting the pet's AI state to follow mode and updating its target
    position to match the hunter's location.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_hunter->GetPet() &&\
      \ m_hunter->GetPet()->IsAlive())\n    {\n        m_hunter->GetPet()->GetAI()->CommandPetFollow();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter has an active pet and that the pet is
    alive. It does not validate these conditions internally, so calling code should
    ensure proper preconditions are met. The actual movement behavior may be influenced
    by the pet's current AI state and any existing movement restrictions.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a pet exists or is alive can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always check for valid pet presence before
    invoking CommandPetFollow.
