  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateDiamondFormation(uint32 memberCount, float
    spacing) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a diamond-shaped formation for group members based on specified
    parameters.
  description: The GenerateDiamondFormation method calculates and applies a diamond
    formation layout for a group of players in World of Warcraft. This formation is
    commonly used for raid or party positioning where members are arranged in a diamond
    pattern to optimize visibility, spell casting, or tactical positioning. The method
    takes into account the number of group members and spacing between them to determine
    optimal positions. It returns an integer value indicating success or failure of
    the formation generation process.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of group members that will be positioned in the
      diamond formation. Must be a positive integer representing valid group size.
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance between each group member in the formation. Should be
      a positive floating-point value defining the spacing in game units.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the result of the formation generation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient group members for
    formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Diamond Formation Generation
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nint result = formation.GenerateDiamondFormation(5,\
      \ 3.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Formation generated successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Diamond formation created for 5 members with 3.0 spacing\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to generate diamond formation\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Based on Group Size
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nuint32 groupSize = player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();\n\
      float spacing = 2.5f;\nint result = formation.GenerateDiamondFormation(groupSize,\
      \ spacing);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Apply the generated formation to group\
      \ members\n    // Implementation depends on how formation data is stored and\
      \ applied\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group positioning systems in TrinityCore.
    The actual implementation may depend on available space, terrain, and other environmental
    factors within the game world. Performance impact is minimal as it's a calculation-based
    operation.
  warnings: Ensure that memberCount is greater than zero to avoid undefined behavior.
    Verify that spacing value is positive to prevent incorrect formation layouts.
    This method may not be thread-safe if used concurrently with other group positioning
    operations.
