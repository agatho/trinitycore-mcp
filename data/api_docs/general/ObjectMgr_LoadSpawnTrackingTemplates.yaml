documentation:
  brief: Loads spawn tracking templates from the database into memory for use during
    world object spawning.
  description: The LoadSpawnTrackingTemplates method initializes and loads spawn tracking
    template data from the database into internal memory structures. This functionality
    is crucial for tracking and managing how creatures and game objects are spawned
    in the world, particularly for dynamic or conditional spawns. The method typically
    executes during server startup or reload operations to ensure that all configured
    spawn templates are available for runtime use. It processes template definitions
    stored in database tables related to spawn tracking, which may include criteria
    such as spawn conditions, timers, and grouping rules. This method is part of the
    ObjectMgr class's initialization sequence and directly affects how the world manages
    object spawning behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n   \
      \ sObjectMgr->LoadSpawnTrackingTemplates();\n    // Continue with other loading\
      \ operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It's important to ensure that the underlying database tables containing spawn
    tracking templates are properly populated before calling this method. The loaded
    templates are used by the SpawnManager and related systems to determine when and
    how objects should be spawned in the world.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started and objects have already
    been spawned may lead to inconsistent behavior or unexpected spawn patterns. It's
    recommended to only call this during initialization phases or controlled reload
    scenarios.
