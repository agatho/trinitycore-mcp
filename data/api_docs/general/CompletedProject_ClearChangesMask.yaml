documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the completed project, resetting its modification
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a CompletedProject instance. This operation typically indicates that any
    pending modifications or updates to the project have been acknowledged and committed,
    effectively clearing the 'dirty' flag that tracks whether the project has been
    modified since last saved or synchronized. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this method is commonly used when synchronizing player
    progress or quest completion states with the database or when preparing a project
    for serialization. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CompletedProject* project = new CompletedProject();

      project->ClearChangesMask();

      // The changes mask is now cleared, indicating no pending modifications.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked after a successful save or synchronization
    operation to ensure that subsequent checks for modified state are accurate. It's
    important to note that clearing the mask does not affect the actual data within
    the project; it only resets the tracking mechanism.
