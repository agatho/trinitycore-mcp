documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager class
  description: The VengeanceSoulFragmentManager constructor initializes the internal
    state and data structures required for managing soul fragments in the context
    of vengeance mechanics. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to handle special soul fragment interactions, particularly those related to player
    vengeance abilities or quest mechanics. The constructor sets up default values
    and prepares the object for subsequent operations such as fragment creation, management,
    or destruction. It ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and initialized
    before the object can be used in gameplay scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of VengeanceSoulFragmentManager
    code: 'VengeanceSoulFragmentManager fragmentManager;

      // The object is now ready for use with vengeance soul fragment operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation that would be considered expensive. It's designed to be lightweight
    and fast, as it's typically called during object creation in game systems. The
    actual functionality of managing soul fragments is handled by other methods in
    the class.
