  class: LootCoordination
  method: HandleLootNinja
  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleLootNinja(Group * group, uint32 suspectedPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Processes loot coordination for a group, identifying and handling suspected
    players in loot distribution.
  description: The HandleLootNinja method is responsible for managing loot coordination
    within a group context, specifically targeting scenarios where a player may be
    suspected of inappropriate loot behavior. This method typically handles the logic
    for identifying such players, potentially removing them from loot distribution
    rights, or triggering appropriate game mechanics to maintain fair play. The method
    operates on a Group object and takes a suspected player's identifier as input.
    It is part of TrinityCore's loot coordination system that helps prevent loot exploitation
    and ensures balanced distribution among group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which loot
      coordination is being handled. Must be a valid group instance with active members.
  - name: suspectedPlayer
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player suspected of inappropriate
      loot behavior. This value should correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleLootNinja
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 suspectedGUID = 12345;

      LootCoordination::HandleLootNinja(myGroup, suspectedGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot distribution events when a player's
    behavior raises suspicion. It may modify internal loot state and potentially send
    notifications to group members about the coordination changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid group could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    The suspectedPlayer GUID must correspond to a real player in the game world.
