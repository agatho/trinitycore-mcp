  class: PhasingHandler
  method: AddVisibleMapId
  signature: void PhasingHandler::AddVisibleMapId(WorldObject * object, uint32 visibleMapId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a visible map ID to the phasing system for the specified object.
  description: The AddVisibleMapId method registers a map ID as visible for a given
    WorldObject within the TrinityCore phasing system. This allows the object to be
    seen and interacted with in the specified map context, even if it's not physically
    located there. The phasing system is used to manage visibility of objects based
    on player conditions, quests, events, or other game mechanics. This method typically
    integrates with the broader phasing framework to update an object's visibility
    state across different maps.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject for which the visible map ID is being
      added. Must not be null.
  - name: visibleMapId
    description: The numeric ID of the map that should become visible for the object.
      This ID must correspond to a valid map in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Visible Map ID to a Player Object
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhasingHandler::AddVisibleMapId(player, 1234); // Makes map 1234 visible to
      the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Visible Map IDs for an NPC
    code: 'Creature* npc = ...;

      PhasingHandler::AddVisibleMapId(npc, 5678);

      PhasingHandler::AddVisibleMapId(npc, 9012); // Makes two maps visible to the
      NPC'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal phasing flags or visibility masks associated
    with the object. It may trigger a re-evaluation of visibility for nearby players
    or objects. The effect is typically immediate but depends on how the phasing system
    is implemented in the specific TrinityCore version.
  warnings: Ensure that the visibleMapId corresponds to an actual map in the game
    world; invalid IDs could cause undefined behavior or errors. This method should
    not be called with null object pointers, as it will likely result in a crash or
    assertion failure.
