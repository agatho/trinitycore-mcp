documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat resurrection for players in the instance
  description: The UseCombatResurrection method is responsible for handling the combat
    resurrection mechanic within an instance script. This method typically triggers
    when a player dies during combat and allows for the resurrection process to begin,
    often involving the use of combat resurrection abilities or items. It manages
    the state transitions and ensures proper resurrection mechanics are applied within
    the context of the instance's combat system. The method is commonly used in dungeon,
    raid, or battleground scripts where combat-based resurrection is required.

    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ Update(uint32 diff) override\n    {\n        // Trigger combat resurrection\
      \ when needed\n        UseCombatResurrection();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player death events in combat zones. Developers should ensure proper instance
    state management before calling this method, as it may depend on specific combat
    conditions or player states.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat contexts may result
    in unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the instance and player states are
    valid before invoking this method.
