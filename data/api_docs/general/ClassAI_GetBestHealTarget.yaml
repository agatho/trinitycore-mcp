  signature: int * ClassAI::GetBestHealTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the most beneficial target for healing within the AI's
    current threat list
  description: The GetBestHealTarget method identifies and returns the GameObject
    or Unit GUID of the target that should be prioritized for healing by the AI-controlled
    healer. This method evaluates the current health status, threat level, and proximity
    of potential targets to determine the optimal healing priority. The returned value
    represents a unique identifier (GUID) which can be used to reference the specific
    target in subsequent AI actions or game logic. The method is typically called
    during the AI's decision-making cycle when healing abilities are available and
    appropriate.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best healing target,
    or nullptr if no suitable target exists within the AI's current scope
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Heal Logic
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = ai->GetBestHealTarget()) {\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *targetGuid);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive()) {\n        // Execute\
      \ healing ability on target\n        DoHeal(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void ClassAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->GetVictim() && me->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n        if (int* healTarget = GetBestHealTarget()) {\n            // Prioritize\
      \ healing over attacking\n            if (DoCastSpellIfCan(*healTarget, SPELL_HEALING_TOUCH)\
      \ == CAST_OK) {\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\
      \    // Continue with normal AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making framework and should be
    called only when the AI has sufficient context about its current combat state.
    The returned GUID may become invalid if the target dies or leaves the AI's detection
    range. The implementation considers factors such as health percentage, distance,
    and threat level to determine priority.
  warnings: The method returns a pointer to an internal value that should not be modified
    directly. Always validate the returned GUID against object existence before using
    it in operations. If multiple heal targets are equally valid, the AI may return
    any one of them based on internal priority logic.
