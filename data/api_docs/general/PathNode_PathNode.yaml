  class: PathNode
  method: PathNode
  signature: void PathNode::PathNode(const int & pos, float spd)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new path node with specified position and speed values.
  description: The PathNode constructor initializes a path node object with the given
    position and speed parameters. This method sets up the internal state of the path
    node, which is typically used in navigation and movement calculations for AI-controlled
    creatures or game entities. The position parameter defines where the node is located
    in the world, while the speed parameter determines how fast an entity should move
    through this node during path following. This constructor is part of the pathfinding
    system that enables NPCs to navigate complex environments in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position index or identifier
      within the pathfinding grid. This value typically corresponds to a specific
      node in the navigation mesh.
  - name: spd
    description: Float value representing the speed at which movement should occur
      through this path node. This affects how quickly entities traverse between nodes
      in the calculated path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PathNode Initialization
    code: 'PathNode node(5, 3.5f);

      // Creates a new path node at position 5 with speed 3.5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple PathNodes for AI Navigation
    code: 'std::vector<PathNode> waypoints;

      waypoints.emplace_back(0, 2.0f);

      waypoints.emplace_back(1, 2.5f);

      waypoints.emplace_back(2, 3.0f);

      // Initializes a series of path nodes for NPC movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the pathfinding system
    when building navigation paths. Developers should be aware that the position parameter
    must correspond to valid indices in the underlying navigation grid, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. The speed value affects movement calculations but
    does not directly control animation speeds.
  warnings: Using invalid position values (e.g., out-of-bounds indices) can lead to
    memory corruption or crashes. Ensure that all path node positions are validated
    against the current navigation mesh before construction. Avoid calling this constructor
    with negative speed values unless specifically intended for special movement behaviors.
