documentation:
  brief: Executes periodic effect update handlers for a specific aura effect
  description: This method processes and triggers the periodic update handlers associated
    with a given aura effect, typically used in conjunction with periodic spells such
    as damage over time or healing over time. It ensures that the effect's periodic
    behavior is properly handled during each tick of the aura's duration. The method
    is called internally by the Aura system when updating periodic effects, and it
    may involve multiple handler calls depending on the type of effect and its implementation.

      \    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling mechanism and should not
    be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked during the aura update
    process to ensure periodic effects are properly applied.
