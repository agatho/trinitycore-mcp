  method: HasEscortState
  signature: bool EscortAI::HasEscortState(int escortState)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if theEscortAI instance has a specific escort state flag set.
  description: The HasEscortState method determines whether a given escort state flag
    is currently active within the EscortAI instance. This method is typically used
    to evaluate the current behavior or status of an escorted NPC during quest progression.
    It allows for conditional logic based on the escort's current operational mode,
    such as whether it is moving, paused, or completed. The method performs a bitwise
    check against internal state flags to determine if the specified state is set.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified escort state flag is currently active; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Check
    code: "if (escortAI->HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_MOVING))\n{\n    // Perform actions\
      \ while escort is moving\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Escort State
    code: "if (!escortAI->HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_ESCORTING))\n{\n    // Start\
      \ escort if not already escorting\n    StartEscort();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Continue\
      \ existing escort\n    UpdateEscort();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal state flags that are managed by the EscortAI
    class. The escort states are typically defined as bit flags, allowing multiple
    states to be active simultaneously. Developers should be aware that the exact
    values of these flags may vary between different versions of TrinityCore and should
    consult the relevant header files for current definitions.
  warnings: Ensure that theEscortState parameter value corresponds to a valid escort
    state flag defined in the codebase. Using an invalid or undefined flag may result
    in unexpected behavior or incorrect state evaluation.
