documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot database connection pool, releasing all active connections
    and cleaning up resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all active database connections within
    the BotDatabasePool, ensuring that no pending operations are left unresolved.
    It is typically invoked during server shutdown or when the bot system needs to
    be temporarily disabled. This method ensures proper cleanup of database resources
    and prevents potential memory leaks or connection exhaustion. The pool will not
    accept new requests after this method is called until it is explicitly restarted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server shutdown procedures to gracefully
    close all database connections. It's important to ensure that no active bot operations
    are running before calling this method to avoid data corruption or incomplete
    transactions.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while active bot processes are running may result in
    abrupt termination of those processes and potential loss of unsaved data. Always
    verify that all bot activities have completed or been properly suspended before
    invoking this method.
