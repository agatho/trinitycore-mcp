  signature: AuraEvent AuraEvent::AuraApplied(int target, int caster, uint32 spellId,
    uint8 stacks, bool harmful)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuraEvent instance representing an aura application
    event.
  description: The AuraApplied method constructs and initializes a new AuraEvent object
    that represents when an aura is applied to a target. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to track and process aura application events
    in the game world. The created event encapsulates information about the target
    unit, the caster, the spell ID, stack count, and whether the aura is harmful.
    It serves as part of the aura management system that handles buffs, debuffs, and
    other magical effects in World of Warcraft-style gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The GUID or identifier of the unit receiving the aura. This represents
      the target of the aura application.
  - name: caster
    description: The GUID or identifier of the unit applying the aura. This represents
      the caster who triggered the aura application.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that created the aura. This is
      used to determine what type of effect is being applied.
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks applied to the target. This indicates how many
      times the aura has been applied or stacked on the target.
  - name: harmful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is harmful (true) or beneficial
      (false). This determines the nature of the effect being applied.
  returns: Returns a newly constructed AuraEvent object representing the aura application
    event with all provided parameters properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application Event Creation
    code: AuraEvent event = AuraEvent::AuraApplied(12345, 67890, 123456, 1, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Stacked Harmful Aura Event
    code: 'AuraEvent event = AuraEvent::AuraApplied(playerGuid, casterGuid, 789012,
      5, true);

      // Represents a harmful aura with 5 stacks applied to a player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura event system and should be
    used within the appropriate context where aura application events are being processed.
    The returned AuraEvent object can then be passed to event handlers or systems
    that process aura-related logic.
  warnings: Ensure all GUIDs provided are valid and represent existing units in the
    game world. Invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes during event
    processing.
