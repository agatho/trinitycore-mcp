  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: PredictMovement
  signature: int FollowBehaviorUtils::PredictMovement(Unit * unit, float timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of a unit based on its current movement behavior
    and time ahead.
  description: The PredictMovement method calculates where a given unit will be located
    after a specified amount of time, taking into account its current movement state
    such as speed, direction, and any ongoing movement behaviors like fleeing or following.
    This utility is commonly used in AI systems to anticipate unit positions for pathfinding,
    targeting, or decision-making logic. The method returns an integer status code
    indicating success or failure of the prediction calculation.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose future position is to be predicted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: The time duration in seconds into the future for which to predict
      movement. Should be a positive value.
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the outcome of the prediction: 0 for success,
    negative values for errors (e.g., invalid input parameters), and potentially positive
    values for specific status codes depending on internal implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Assume this is a valid unit\nint result = FollowBehaviorUtils::PredictMovement(target,\
      \ 2.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Movement prediction was successful\n  \
      \  // Proceed with further logic using predicted position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Unit* player = ...;\nfloat timeToPredict = 5.0f;\nint status = FollowBehaviorUtils::PredictMovement(player,\
      \ timeToPredict);\nif (status < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to predict movement for unit %u\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      } else if (status == 0) {\n    // Prediction succeeded\n    // Use predicted\
      \ position for AI decision making\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal movement state of the unit and may not
    account for all dynamic factors such as sudden changes in speed or direction.
    It is recommended to call this function only when the unit's movement behavior
    is stable or predictable. Performance-wise, it should be used sparingly in tight
    loops due to potential computational overhead.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for the 'unit' parameter; doing so may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, very large values for 'timeAhead' might
    lead to inaccurate predictions due to movement state changes over time.
