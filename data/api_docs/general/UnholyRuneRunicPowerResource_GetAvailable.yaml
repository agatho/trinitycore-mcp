  signature: uint32 UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total available runic power that can be spent
    by an Unholy Death Knight.
  description: The GetAvailable method computes the current amount of runic power
    that is immediately accessible to an Unholy Death Knight for spending on abilities.
    This value represents the sum of all currently active runes and any accumulated
    runic power from passive regeneration, excluding any pending or locked resources.
    The method is typically used by the game engine to determine how much power a
    player can spend in their current state without triggering resource limitations
    or cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total available runic power points that
    can be immediately consumed by abilities. This value is capped at the maximum
    possible runic power (typically 1000) and reflects the player's current resource
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Available Runic Power Before Casting
    code: "uint32 availablePower = player->GetRuneResource()->GetAvailable();\nif\
      \ (availablePower >= 500)\n{\n    // Cast a high-cost ability\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEATH_COIL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for temporary resource modifiers or buffs that
    may affect runic power generation. It returns only the base available amount based
    on current rune states and passive regeneration.
