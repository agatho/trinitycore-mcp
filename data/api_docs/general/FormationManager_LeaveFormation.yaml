  signature: bool FormationManager::LeaveFormation()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the current unit from its formation and resets formation-related
    flags.
  description: The LeaveFormation method removes the calling unit from its current
    formation, if it is part of one. This method handles the cleanup of formation-specific
    data such as formation GUIDs, formation positions, and related flags. It ensures
    that the unit no longer follows formation movement patterns or maintains formation-specific
    behavior. The method returns true if the unit was successfully removed from a
    formation, or false if the unit was not in a formation to begin with. This functionality
    is typically used when a unit needs to break free from a group formation, such
    as during combat, movement changes, or when the formation is disbanded.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit was successfully removed from its formation, false
    if the unit was not in a formation or if the operation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LeaveFormation
    code: "if (player->GetFormationManager()->LeaveFormation()) {\n    // Unit successfully\
      \ left formation\n    sLog->outString(\"Player left formation.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player was not in a formation\n    sLog->outString(\"Player was not\
      \ in a formation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the unit is currently part of a formation and will
    clean up internal formation state. It may be called during combat or movement
    changes to allow units to act independently. The method does not trigger any AI
    events or callbacks related to formation changes, so additional logic may be required
    for custom behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit that is not in a formation will return false
    but will not cause an error. Ensure proper checks are made before calling this
    method if the unit's formation status is uncertain.
