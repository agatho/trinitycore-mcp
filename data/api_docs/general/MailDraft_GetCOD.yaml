documentation:
  brief: Returns the cash-on-delivery amount associated with the mail draft
  description: The GetCOD method retrieves the cash-on-delivery (COD) amount that
    was set for a mail draft. This value represents the amount of gold that the recipient
    must pay upon receiving the mail, typically used when sending items with a cost
    attached. The returned value is expressed in copper units (1 gold = 100 silver
    = 10000 copper). This method is commonly used in conjunction with mail systems
    to handle transactions where the sender wants to ensure payment before delivery
    of items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the cash-on-delivery amount in copper units.
    Returns 0 if no COD was set for the mail draft.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve COD amount from a MailDraft
    code: "MailDraft draft(\"Subject\", \"Body\");\ndraft.SetCOD(50000); // Set COD\
      \ to 5g\nuint64 codAmount = draft.GetCOD(); // Returns 50000\nif (codAmount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process COD payment\n    sLog->outString(\"Mail requires COD\
      \ payment of %u copper\", codAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of mail system implementations
    where items are sent with a monetary condition. The returned value should be interpreted
    as copper units, which is the standard currency representation in TrinityCore.
    Ensure that the COD amount is properly validated before processing payment.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate whether the COD amount is
    within reasonable limits or if it's been set at all. It simply returns whatever
    value was previously assigned to the mail draft. Also, in some cases, a value
    of 0 may indicate either no COD was set or an error condition.
