documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotHealthCheck instance by copying data from an existing
    BotHealthCheck object.
  description: The BotHealthCheck constructor initializes a new instance of the BotHealthCheck
    class by performing a deep copy of another BotHealthCheck object. This method
    is typically used when creating duplicate instances or when transferring health
    check configurations between different bot entities within the TrinityCore framework.
    The copied object maintains identical state and configuration as the source object,
    ensuring consistent behavior across multiple bot instances. This constructor follows
    standard C++ copy semantics and is essential for proper object management in the
    context of AI-driven bot systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'BotHealthCheck original;

      // Configure original...

      BotHealthCheck copy(original); // Uses the copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void CreateBotWithHealthCheck() {\n  \
      \      BotHealthCheck defaultCheck;\n        BotHealthCheck newBotCheck(defaultCheck);\
      \ // Copy health check settings\n        // Apply newBotCheck to new bot instance\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the object's internal state.
    If the BotHealthCheck class contains pointers or dynamic memory allocations, developers
    should ensure proper deep copying behavior is implemented in the assignment operator
    to prevent memory issues. The constructor does not perform any validation on the
    source object's data, so it assumes the input is valid.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor with objects that contain non-trivial
    members (e.g., pointers). If the class manages resources, ensure that copy semantics
    are properly implemented to avoid double-free errors or resource leaks. This constructor
    may not be suitable for objects that require special initialization logic beyond
    simple data copying.
