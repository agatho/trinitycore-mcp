  class: GossipHandler
  method: ContainsKeywords
  signature: bool GossipHandler::ContainsKeywords(const std::string & text, const
    int & keywords) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given text contains specified keywords.
  description: The ContainsKeywords method evaluates whether a provided string contains
    any of the specified keywords. This functionality is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft's gossip system to filter and match player input or NPC dialogue with
    predefined keyword sets. The method performs a case-insensitive search within
    the text for each keyword and returns true if at least one keyword is found. It
    is typically employed in quest systems, NPC interactions, and dialogue management
    where specific user inputs need to be recognized and responded to appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: The string to search within for keywords. This represents the text
      content that will be scanned for keyword matches.
  - name: keywords
    description: An integer identifier representing a set of keywords to search for.
      In TrinityCore's implementation, this is typically a bitmask or lookup value
      that maps to specific keyword definitions in the database.
  returns: Returns true if any of the keywords specified by the 'keywords' parameter
    are found within the 'text' string; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Keyword Search
    code: "if (gossipHandler.ContainsKeywords(\"Hello there, adventurer!\", 1234))\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where keywords 1234 are found\n    player->SendGossipMenu(1001,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with NPC Dialogue
    code: "std::string playerInput = \"I want to buy something\";\nif (gossipHandler.ContainsKeywords(playerInput,\
      \ 5678)) {\n    // Trigger shop dialogue\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(npc->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a case-insensitive search which means it will match keywords
    regardless of their capitalization in the input text. The 'keywords' parameter
    is expected to be a valid identifier that maps to actual keyword definitions stored
    in the TrinityCore database tables, typically found in gossip_menu_option or similar
    tables.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'keywords' parameter corresponds to valid entries in the
    database; otherwise, the method may not behave as expected. Be cautious when using
    this method with large text inputs as performance could be affected by extensive
    string searching operations.
