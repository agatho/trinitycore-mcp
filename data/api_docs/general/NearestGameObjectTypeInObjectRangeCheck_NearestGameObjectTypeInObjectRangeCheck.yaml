  class: NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck
  method: NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck::NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck(const
    NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a nearest game object type in object range check with another
    instance of the same class.
  description: The NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes
    a new instance by copying the state from an existing instance of the same class.
    This class is typically used within TrinityCore's AI and object interaction systems
    to find the nearest game object of a specific type within a given range of another
    object. It's commonly employed in pathfinding, quest triggering, or NPC behavior
    logic where proximity to certain game objects matters. The constructor performs
    a shallow copy of internal state variables but does not perform deep copying of
    complex data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source instance of NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck from
      which to copy the initialization state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an existing check instance
    code: 'NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck originalCheck(gameObjectType, range);

      NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck newCheck(originalCheck); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor implementation. The class likely contains internal
    state tracking for game object types and ranges, which are copied during construction.
    Be aware that if the class holds pointers or references to external objects, this
    may lead to shallow copying behavior.
