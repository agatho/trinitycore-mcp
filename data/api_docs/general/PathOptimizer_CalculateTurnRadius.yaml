  signature: float PathOptimizer::CalculateTurnRadius(float speed, float angle) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the turn radius for a unit based on its speed and angle of movement.
  description: The CalculateTurnRadius method computes the radius of the turn that
    a unit will make when moving at a given speed and turning at a specified angle.
    This is used in pathfinding and movement calculations within the TrinityCore engine
    to determine how sharply a unit can turn while traveling along a path. The calculation
    takes into account both the movement speed of the unit and the angle it needs
    to turn, which affects the turning radius required for smooth navigation. This
    method is typically invoked during AI path optimization to ensure realistic and
    efficient movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: speed
    description: The current movement speed of the unit (in yards per second). Must
      be a positive value representing the unit's velocity.
  - name: angle
    description: "The angle of turn in radians. This represents the direction change\
      \ needed for the unit's movement path. Values are typically between 0 and \u03C0\
      \ (180 degrees) for turns."
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated turn radius in yards.
    A larger radius indicates a wider, more gradual turn, while a smaller radius indicates
    a tighter turn. The result is always non-negative.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Turn Radius Calculation
    code: float radius = optimizer.CalculateTurnRadius(5.0f, 0.785f); // 5 yards/sec,
      45 degree turn
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Turn Radius in Movement Logic
    code: 'float speed = unit->GetSpeed(MOVE_RUN);

      float angle = CalculateAngleToTarget(unit, target);

      float turnRadius = optimizer.CalculateTurnRadius(speed, angle);

      // Use turnRadius to adjust pathfinding or movement behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that speed and angle are valid positive values. The implementation
    likely uses physics-based calculations to simulate realistic turning behavior
    for game units. Performance is generally good as it's a simple mathematical computation,
    but frequent calls should be monitored in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: "Ensure that the speed parameter is not zero or negative, as this could\
    \ lead to incorrect results or division by zero errors in underlying calculations.\
    \ The angle should typically be within reasonable bounds (0 to \u03C0 radians)\
    \ for meaningful turn radius computations."
