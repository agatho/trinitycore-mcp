  class: LOSCache
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics LOSCache::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the line-of-sight cache usage and
    performance.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing detailed
    metrics about the LOSCache's internal state, including cache hit/miss ratios,
    total entries, and memory usage. This method is typically used for debugging,
    performance monitoring, or optimizing the line-of-sight calculation system within
    TrinityCore. The returned statistics provide insights into how efficiently the
    cache is being utilized and can help identify potential bottlenecks in visibility
    calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing various metrics such as hit count, miss
    count, total entries, and memory consumption related to the LOSCache's operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'LOSCache cache;

      // ... populate cache with data ...

      LOSCache::Statistics stats = cache.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Hits: " << stats.hit_count << ", Misses: " << stats.miss_count
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without locking.
    The Statistics object returned is a snapshot at the time of the call and may not
    reflect real-time changes in cache state.
