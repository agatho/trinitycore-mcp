  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: RequiresTeleport
  signature: bool FollowBehaviorUtils::RequiresTeleport(Player * bot, Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player requires teleportation to maintain follow
    behavior with a leader player.
  description: The RequiresTeleport method evaluates if a bot player needs to be teleported
    to keep up with their leader player during follow behavior. This typically occurs
    when the distance between the bot and leader exceeds a predefined threshold, or
    when the bot is in an area where movement is restricted. The method considers
    factors such as world boundaries, instance limitations, and movement mechanics
    to decide if teleportation is necessary for maintaining the follow state. It returns
    true if teleportation is required, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that may require
      teleportation
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader whose position
      the bot is following
  returns: Returns true if the bot requires teleportation to maintain follow behavior
    with the leader; returns false if no teleportation is needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a follow behavior context
    code: "if (FollowBehaviorUtils::RequiresTeleport(botPlayer, leaderPlayer)) {\n\
      \    // Initiate teleportation logic\n    botPlayer->TeleportTo(leaderPlayer->GetMapId(),\
      \ leaderPlayer->GetPositionX(), leaderPlayer->GetPositionY(), leaderPlayer->GetPositionZ(),\
      \ leaderPlayer->GetOrientation());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateFollowBehavior(Player* bot, Player*\
      \ leader) {\n        if (FollowBehaviorUtils::RequiresTeleport(bot, leader))\
      \ {\n            // Handle teleportation\n            bot->TeleportTo(leader->GetMapId(),\
      \ leader->GetPositionX(), leader->GetPositionY(), leader->GetPositionZ(), leader->GetOrientation());\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Continue normal movement\n            bot->MoveTowards(leader);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI behavior systems for
    managing group dynamics in World of Warcraft. The decision logic may vary based
    on server configuration settings and game mechanics such as instance limits, map
    boundaries, or special zone restrictions.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and leader pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent null pointer exceptions. Be cautious when implementing teleportation
    logic as it can disrupt smooth movement animations and may cause unexpected behavior
    if not handled properly in the context of group mechanics.
