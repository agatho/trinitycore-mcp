api:
  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: GenerateStateDiagram
  signature: std::string GroupStateMachine::GenerateStateDiagram()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a visual state diagram representation of the group state machine.
  description: The GenerateStateDiagram method creates and returns a string representation
    of the current state diagram for the GroupStateMachine. This diagram visually
    illustrates the possible states and transitions within the group management system,
    which is crucial for understanding how groups are managed during various game
    events such as player joining, leaving, or disbanding. The output typically follows
    a graphviz-compatible format that can be rendered into visual diagrams for debugging
    or documentation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the state diagram representation in a format suitable
    for visualization, typically following graphviz DOT syntax that represents states
    as nodes and transitions as directed edges with labels indicating trigger conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupStateMachine gsm;

      std::string diagram = gsm.GenerateStateDiagram();

      // Output can be saved to file or displayed in debug console

      std::cout << diagram << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and documentation purposes.
    The generated diagram may include internal state identifiers that are not directly
    exposed through public APIs. It's recommended to use this method in development
    environments rather than production code due to potential performance overhead
    from generating textual representations.
  warnings: The output format of the diagram might change between different TrinityCore
    versions, so relying on specific formatting for external tools may break in future
    updates. Also, this method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks
    internally, so calling it from multiple threads simultaneously could result in
    inconsistent outputs.
