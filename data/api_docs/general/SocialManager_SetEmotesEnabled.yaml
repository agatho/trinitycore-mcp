  class: SocialManager
  method: SetEmotesEnabled
  signature: void SocialManager::SetEmotesEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables emote functionality for a player in the social system.
  description: The SetEmotesEnabled method controls whether a player can use emotes
    within the game's social system. When enabled, players can perform emotes such
    as waving, cheering, or other animations. When disabled, emote commands are effectively
    ignored by the server. This setting is typically managed through player permissions,
    game rules, or administrative controls. The change takes effect immediately for
    the affected player and may influence interactions with other players in the same
    zone or instance.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether emotes should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Emotes for a Player
    code: player->GetSocial()->SetEmotesEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Emotes Based on Player Status
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat())\n{\n    player->GetSocial()->SetEmotesEnabled(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->GetSocial()->SetEmotesEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the SocialManager class.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other social settings like friend lists
    or ignore lists. The change does not persist across sessions unless explicitly
    saved to the database.
  warnings: Calling this method may affect player experience and social interactions.
    Disabling emotes for players in active combat zones could lead to unexpected behavior
    or user frustration if not handled carefully.
