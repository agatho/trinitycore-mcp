  brief: Initializes a new combat reference by copying data from an existing combat
    reference object.
  description: The CombatReference constructor initializes a new combat reference
    instance by copying all relevant data from another CombatReference object. This
    method is typically used when creating duplicate references or when transferring
    combat state information between different combat-related entities in the TrinityCore
    framework. The copied data includes combat metrics, target information, and any
    associated combat flags or states that define the current combat scenario. This
    constructor ensures proper initialization of combat references without requiring
    manual setup of individual properties.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an Existing Combat Reference
    code: 'CombatReference originalRef(...); // Assume this is initialized

      CombatReference newRef(originalRef); // Creates a copy of originalRef'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the combat reference data. If
    the CombatReference contains pointers or complex objects, care should be taken
    to ensure proper deep copying behavior if required by the specific implementation.
    The method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore combat system.
