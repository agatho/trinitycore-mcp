documentation:
  brief: Loads complaint ticket data from the database into the object's member variables.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes a ComplaintTicket object's internal
    state by extracting data from a database row represented by the Field array parameter.
    This method is typically invoked during the creation or retrieval of complaint
    tickets from the database, ensuring that all relevant ticket information such
    as ticket ID, player GUID, timestamp, and complaint details are properly populated
    within the object. It serves as part of the object-relational mapping process
    for complaint tickets in the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Loading a Complaint Ticket from Database
    code: 'ComplaintTicket ticket;

      Field* fields = new Field[5];

      // Assume fields are populated with database data

      .ticket.LoadFromDB(fields);

      // Ticket is now initialized with data from the database row'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Field array passed to it contains valid data
    corresponding to the expected columns in the complaint ticket database table.
    The implementation likely relies on specific column ordering and data types matching
    the database schema.
