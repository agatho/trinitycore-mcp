  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: SetAutoAccept
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::SetAutoAccept(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic acceptance of group invitations for the player.
  description: The SetAutoAccept method configures whether a player's character will
    automatically accept incoming group invitations without manual confirmation. When
    enabled, the player will automatically join any group invitation they receive.
    When disabled, the player must manually accept or decline each invitation. This
    setting affects the player's group invitation behavior in World of Warcraft and
    is typically used to streamline gameplay for players who frequently join groups.
    The method does not validate whether the player is currently in a group or has
    pending invitations; it only changes the automatic acceptance behavior for future
    invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      automatic group invitation acceptance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Accept for Group Invitations
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.SetAutoAccept(true); // Automatically accept all group invitations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Accept for Group Invitations
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.SetAutoAccept(false); // Require manual confirmation for group invitations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the player's invitation handling behavior at runtime.
    The setting persists across sessions until changed again, and affects all future
    group invitations received by the player. It does not impact existing group memberships
    or ongoing group activities.
