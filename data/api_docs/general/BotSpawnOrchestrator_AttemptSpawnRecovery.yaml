  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::AttemptSpawnRecovery(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover and spawn a bot based on the provided request identifier.
  description: The AttemptSpawnRecovery method is responsible for handling the logic
    required to respawn or recover a bot within the TrinityCore framework. It takes
    a request identifier as input, which typically corresponds to a specific bot or
    spawn configuration. The method evaluates whether the recovery process can be
    initiated and performs the necessary steps to spawn the bot if conditions are
    met. This functionality is commonly used in bot management systems where bots
    may need to be respawned after death or when their state becomes invalid. The
    method ensures that appropriate checks are performed before attempting to spawn
    a new instance of the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific bot recovery request.
      This value is typically used to determine which bot configuration or spawn point
      should be used for the recovery process.
  returns: Returns true if the bot recovery and spawning process was successfully
    initiated; otherwise, returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient resources, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Recovery Attempt
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\nint recoveryRequest = 12345;\nbool\
      \ success = orchestrator.AttemptSpawnRecovery(recoveryRequest);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Bot recovery initiated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot state tracking and spawn point
    management systems. Developers should ensure that the request parameter is valid
    and corresponds to an existing bot configuration before calling this method to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the request parameter
    may lead to undefined behavior or failed spawning attempts. Ensure that all preconditions
    for bot recovery are satisfied prior to invocation.
