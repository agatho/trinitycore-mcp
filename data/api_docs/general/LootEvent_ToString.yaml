documentation:
  brief: Converts a LootEvent object into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of the LootEvent
    object, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying event information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly employed in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to serialize loot-related events for monitoring and analysis purposes.
    The output string usually includes key identifiers such as the event type, associated
    player GUID, item information, and other relevant metadata that helps developers
    understand the context of the loot event without requiring deep inspection of
    internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the LootEvent object.
    The string typically includes identifiers such as event type, player GUID, item
    ID, quantity, and other relevant properties that define the loot event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'LootEvent event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("loot", "Loot Event: {}", eventString);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Loot Events in Game Server
    code: "void HandlePlayerLoot(Player* player, Item* item) {\n    LootEvent event;\n\
      \    // ... initialize event with player and item data ...\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      loot\", \"Player {} looted item {}: {}\", \n        player->GetName(), item->GetEntry(),\
      \ event.ToString());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and logging purposes. The
    exact format of the returned string may vary based on implementation details within
    TrinityCore's loot system. It should not be relied upon for parsing or programmatic
    logic, as the format might change between versions.
  warnings: The ToString method does not validate input data or handle error conditions
    gracefully. If the LootEvent object is in an invalid state, the resulting string
    may contain garbage values or incomplete information. Ensure that all required
    fields are properly initialized before calling this method.
