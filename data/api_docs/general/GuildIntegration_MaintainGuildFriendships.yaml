  signature: void GuildIntegration::MaintainGuildFriendships(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains guild friendship relationships by updating player guild affiliations
    and friendship status.
  description: The MaintainGuildFriendships method is responsible for ensuring that
    guild member friendships are properly maintained within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely handles synchronization of guild-related friendship data, updates
    player guild affiliations, and manages any friendship status changes that occur
    when players join or leave guilds. It operates on a per-player basis using the
    provided player identifier to ensure that all relevant friendship relationships
    are correctly updated in the game state. The method may also handle cleanup of
    stale friendship entries or validation of existing guild relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for whom guild friendships need to be maintained. This parameter is used
      to identify which specific player's guild relationships should be updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.MaintainGuildFriendships(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Player Object Reference
    code: "Player* playerObj = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nif (playerObj)\n{\n    int playerId = playerObj->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.MaintainGuildFriendships(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations to synchronize friendship
    data and may involve multiple internal calls to update guild membership tables.
    It should be called whenever a player's guild status changes to ensure proper
    relationship maintenance. The method signature suggests it works with a pointer
    to an integer, which is typical for GUID handling in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual online or existing player. Passing an invalid or null GUID could result
    in undefined behavior or database corruption. This method may be performance-intensive
    when processing large guilds due to the need to update multiple friendship relationships.
