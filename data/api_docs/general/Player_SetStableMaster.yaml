  method: SetStableMaster
  signature: void Player::SetStableMaster(int stableMaster)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the stable master for the player to manage their pet's stable slots.
  description: This method assigns a stable master to the player, allowing them to
    access and manage their pet's stable slots. The stable master is typically a NPC
    that provides services for storing and retrieving pets. This method is used in
    conjunction with other pet management functions to enable players to control their
    pet's storage location within the game world. The function does not directly handle
    any pet-related operations but rather sets up the connection between the player
    and the stable master.
  parameters:
  - name: stableMaster
    description: The ID of the stable master NPC that will manage the player's pet's
      stable slots. This value typically corresponds to an NPC's entry ID in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Stable Master
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetStableMaster(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when the player is near a stable master NPC.
    The implementation likely involves setting up internal references to the stable
    master, and may require the player to be in proximity to the NPC for proper functionality.
  warnings: The stable master parameter must correspond to an existing NPC entry in
    the database. If an invalid ID is used, the method may fail silently or cause
    issues with pet storage. This method should not be called while the player is
    in combat or during other critical game states.
