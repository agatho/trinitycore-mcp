  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: BotAIInitializer
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::BotAIInitializer(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot AI system with the provided bot identifier.
  description: The BotAIInitializer method is responsible for setting up and configuring
    the artificial intelligence behavior for a specific bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically prepares the necessary data structures and initializes
    the AI state machine that governs how the bot will interact with the game world,
    including movement, combat decisions, and quest handling. It ensures that the
    bot's AI is properly linked to its character instance and ready to execute commands
    or respond to events in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer identifier representing the unique bot instance.
      This value is used to associate the AI initialization with a specific bot character
      within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Initialization
    code: 'int botId = 42;

      BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.BotAIInitializer(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a bot has been created and registered
    in the game world. The initialization process may involve loading AI scripts,
    setting up behavior trees, or configuring decision-making parameters based on
    the bot's role (e.g., healer, tank, damage dealer).
  warnings: Ensure that the bot identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing bot instance; otherwise, the method may cause undefined behavior
    or crashes.
