  class: Corpse
  method: ReplaceAllCorpseDynamicFlags
  signature: void Corpse::ReplaceAllCorpseDynamicFlags(int dynamicFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all dynamic flags on the corpse with the specified value.
  description: The ReplaceAllCorpseDynamicFlags method updates the dynamic flags of
    a Corpse object to the provided integer value. Dynamic flags in TrinityCore represent
    various temporary states or properties of game objects, such as whether a corpse
    is looted, has been flagged for decay, or is protected from certain interactions.
    This method directly modifies the internal dynamic flags field of the corpse instance.
    The operation affects how the corpse behaves within the game world, including
    visibility, interaction capabilities, and loot availability. This method should
    be used carefully as it can alter the corpse's state in ways that may impact player
    experience or server mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: dynamicFlags
    description: An integer value representing the new dynamic flags to set on the
      corpse. This value is typically a bitmask combining various flag constants defined
      for corpse behavior, such as being looted, decayed, or protected from despawning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Corpse as Looted
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      const int LOOTED_FLAG = 0x01;

      corpse->ReplaceAllCorpseDynamicFlags(LOOTED_FLAG);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing All Dynamic Flags
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      const int NO_FLAGS = 0x00;

      corpse->ReplaceAllCorpseDynamicFlags(NO_FLAGS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Corpse object. It
    should only be called when necessary, as improper flag manipulation can lead to
    unexpected behavior in corpse handling or player interactions. The dynamic flags
    are typically managed by the server logic and may be automatically updated during
    normal gameplay.
  warnings: Modifying dynamic flags manually can interfere with normal server operations
    or cause inconsistencies if not done correctly. Ensure that the provided flag
    values are valid and appropriate for the intended behavior. Incorrect usage might
    result in corpses not despawning properly or being interacted with in unintended
    ways.
