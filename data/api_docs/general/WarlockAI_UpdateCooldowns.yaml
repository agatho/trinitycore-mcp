  signature: void WarlockAI::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for warlock abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown states of various warlock abilities within the AI system. This method
    is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure that abilities are properly
    tracked for when they become available again. It handles internal cooldown tracking
    logic, including resetting ability availability once their cooldown periods have
    elapsed. The method takes a time delta parameter to accurately calculate how much
    time has passed since the last update, which is essential for proper cooldown
    management in real-time game scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) since the last update call.
      This value is used to determine how much time has passed and whether any cooldowns
      should be reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Usage
    code: "void WarlockAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    // Perform regular AI actions\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    \n    // Use abilities based on cooldown status\n    if (CanCastSpell(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT))\n\
      \    {\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. The 'diff' parameter must represent actual elapsed
    time in milliseconds for correct behavior. Cooldowns are managed internally by
    the AI system and do not require external management.
  warnings: Do not call this method without providing a valid time delta value. Passing
    incorrect or zero time deltas may cause unexpected behavior in cooldown calculations.
    Ensure that UpdateCooldowns is called consistently within the AI update cycle
    to maintain proper ability availability tracking.
