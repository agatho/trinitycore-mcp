documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootItem object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~LootItem destructor is automatically invoked when a LootItem object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory or resources associated with the loot item,
    such as references to item templates or internal data structures. In the context
    of TrinityCore's loot system, this destructor plays a vital role in preventing
    memory leaks when items are removed from loot caches or when loot containers are
    destroyed. The destruction process typically involves releasing any held references
    and ensuring that no dangling pointers remain in the system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of LootItem
    code: "void ProcessLoot()\n{\n    LootItem* item = new LootItem();\n    // ...\
      \ use item ...\n    delete item; // Triggers ~LootItem destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: LootItem in Container Context
    code: "std::vector<LootItem> lootContainer;\n{\n    LootItem item1, item2;\n \
      \   lootContainer.push_back(item1);\n    lootContainer.push_back(item2);\n}\
      \ // ~LootItem called for each item upon container destruction"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. Developers should ensure that no external references to the
    LootItem object exist before it goes out of scope, as this could lead to undefined
    behavior if the destructor attempts to clean up resources that are still being
    accessed.
