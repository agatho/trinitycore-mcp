documentation:
  brief: Validates a bot session and returns true if the session is valid and active.
  description: The ValidateSession method checks whether a given bot session is currently
    valid and active within the TrinityCore framework. This typically involves verifying
    that the session has not expired, the associated player character is still logged
    in, and all necessary resources are properly initialized. The method ensures that
    only legitimate and operational bot sessions are processed further by the system.
    It serves as a crucial gatekeeping function to maintain system integrity and prevent
    operations on stale or invalid sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session is valid and active; otherwise returns false
    if the session has expired, is inactive, or fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Validation
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = botSessionFactory->CreateSession(playerGuid);\n\
      if (botSessionFactory->ValidateSession(session)) {\n    // Proceed with bot\
      \ operations\n    session->ExecuteCommand(\"move forward\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle invalid session\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Invalid bot session for\
      \ player {}\", playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before performing any operations on a bot
    session to ensure it's still valid. It may perform checks such as verifying the
    player's login status, checking session timeouts, and confirming that required
    subsystems are initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already destroyed or invalid session pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure proper lifetime management of BotSession
    objects before calling ValidateSession.
