documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of available bot sessions in the resource pool
  description: The GetAvailableSessionCount method retrieves the number of bot sessions
    that are currently free and ready to be assigned to players. This method is typically
    used by the bot management system to determine how many additional bots can be
    spawned or allocated. The returned value represents the current capacity of the
    resource pool for bot sessions, which may be limited by server configuration or
    available system resources. This count is essential for maintaining optimal performance
    and preventing resource exhaustion when managing multiple bot instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available bot sessions in the
    pool. Returns zero if no sessions are available or if the pool has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Available Sessions
    code: "uint32 availableCount = botResourcePool->GetAvailableSessionCount();\n\
      if (availableCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with allocating a bot session\n \
      \   LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Available bot sessions: {}\", availableCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Available Count for Session Management
    code: "uint32 maxBots = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_MAX_BOT_COUNT);\nuint32 available\
      \ = botResourcePool->GetAvailableSessionCount();\n\nif (available > 0 && totalActiveBots\
      \ < maxBots)\n{\n    // Allocate a new bot session\n    BotSession* session\
      \ = botResourcePool->AllocateSession();\n    if (session)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Assign the session to a player\n        session->AssignToPlayer(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the internal session
    counter. The value returned may change between calls if other threads are allocating
    or deallocating bot sessions concurrently. The resource pool maintains an internal
    lock to ensure consistency of this count.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned count will remain constant between multiple
    calls. Concurrent modifications by other threads can cause the available count
    to fluctuate. Always verify the current availability before attempting to allocate
    a session.
