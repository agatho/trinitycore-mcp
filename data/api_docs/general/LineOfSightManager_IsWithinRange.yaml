  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsWithinRange
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsWithinRange(const int & from, const int &
    to, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two objects are within a specified maximum range of each
    other.
  description: The IsWithinRange method checks if the distance between two objects,
    identified by their unique identifiers (from and to), is less than or equal to
    the provided maximum range. This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as spell targeting, line-of-sight calculations, and proximity-based interactions.
    The method performs a fast distance check without considering obstacles or terrain
    height differences, making it suitable for determining basic spatial relationships
    between entities.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the first object from which to measure
      distance.
  - name: to
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the second object to which distance
      is measured.
  - name: maxRange
    description: The maximum allowed distance between the two objects. Must be a positive
      value greater than zero.
  returns: Returns true if both objects exist and are within the specified range;
    otherwise returns false. The method will also return false if either object does
    not exist or if maxRange is less than or equal to zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check
    code: "if (sLineOfSightManager->IsWithinRange(playerGuid, targetGuid, 30.0f))\
      \ {\n    // Player and target are within 30 yards\n    SendSpellCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_OUT_OF_RANGE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Spell Targeting
    code: "Unit* caster = GetCaster();\nUnit* target = GetTarget();\nif (!sLineOfSightManager->IsWithinRange(caster->GetGUID(),\
      \ target->GetGUID(), 40.0f)) {\n    // Spell fails due to range\n    SendCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_OUT_OF_RANGE);\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Proceed with spell logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a simple Euclidean distance calculation and does not account
    for height differences or obstacles. It's optimized for performance and should
    be used in scenarios where quick range checks are needed, such as during spell
    casting or AI decision-making processes.
  warnings: Ensure that both GUIDs refer to valid objects before calling this method;
    otherwise behavior is undefined. Also note that this check does not consider line-of-sight
    obstruction, so it may return true even when the objects cannot actually see each
    other due to walls or terrain.
