  class: Player
  method: SetSkillRank
  signature: void Player::SetSkillRank(uint32 pos, uint16 rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the skill rank for a specified skill position in the player's skill
    list.
  description: The SetSkillRank method allows developers to modify the rank of a specific
    skill in a player's skill list. This method is commonly used in custom scripts
    or game master commands to adjust player skill levels. The skill position parameter
    determines which skill to update, while the rank parameter specifies the new skill
    level. This method directly affects the player's skill database and can influence
    various gameplay mechanics such as crafting, professions, or combat abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The skill position in the player's skill list. This typically corresponds
      to a specific skill index within the player's skill database.
  - name: rank
    description: The new skill rank value to set for the specified skill position.
      Valid values range from 0 to 45000, representing the skill level in the game
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a skill rank to maximum
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillRank(1, 45000);

      // Sets the first skill to maximum rank'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting skill rank for crafting profession
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillRank(3, 300);

      // Sets the third skill (e.g., Enchanting) to rank 300'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's skill database and should be used
    carefully as it bypasses normal game progression mechanics. The method may trigger
    updates to related systems such as skill points allocation or profession bonuses.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay, especially
    when setting skills beyond normal limits. This method does not validate the skill
    position or rank values, so developers must ensure correct parameter usage to
    avoid corrupting player data.
