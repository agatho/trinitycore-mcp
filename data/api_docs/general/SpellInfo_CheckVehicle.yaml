  brief: Checks if the spell can be cast on a vehicle
  description: The CheckVehicle method evaluates whether a spell can be cast on a
    vehicle, typically used during spell casting validation to ensure that the target
    vehicle meets the necessary requirements for the spell. This method is part of
    the SpellInfo class and provides a mechanism to validate vehicle-specific conditions
    before allowing spell execution. The method returns a SpellCastResult indicating
    whether the spell can proceed or if there are specific errors preventing its use.
  parameters: []
  returns: SpellCastResult representing the result of the vehicle check, where 'SUCCESS'
    indicates the spell can be cast on the vehicle, and other values indicate various
    failure conditions such as 'FAILED' or 'DENIED'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spellInfo->CheckVehicle(caster);\nif (result ==\
      \ SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell validation
    methods to ensure proper handling of vehicle-based spell mechanics. It may involve
    checking for valid vehicle requirements such as passenger capacity, vehicle state,
    or specific vehicle abilities.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context; it's intended
    for internal spell validation routines and may not be suitable for direct use
    in game logic without careful consideration of the spell's requirements.
