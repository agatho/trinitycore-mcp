documentation:
  brief: Assigns target units to a DPS player based on enemy count in dungeon environment
  description: The AssignDpsTargets method is responsible for determining and assigning
    appropriate target units to a DungeonBehavior's DPS player during dungeon encounters.
    This method evaluates the current number of enemies present and selects optimal
    targets for the DPS player to engage, typically prioritizing high-value or threat-generating
    enemies. The assignment process considers factors such as enemy positioning, threat
    levels, and the overall dungeon encounter mechanics. This method is crucial for
    maintaining balanced combat distribution and ensuring effective DPS allocation
    during dungeon encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character that
      will receive target assignments
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the current number of enemies
      present in the dungeon encounter area
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DPS Target Assignment
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get reference to\
      \ player\n    int enemyCount = 5;\n    dungeonBehavior.AssignDpsTargets(player,\
      \ enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Assignment During Encounter
    code: "void updateDungeonEncounter() {\n    Player* dpsPlayer = GetDpsPlayer();\n\
      \    int currentEnemies = GetEnemyCount();\n    if (currentEnemies > 0) {\n\
      \        dungeonBehavior.AssignDpsTargets(dpsPlayer, currentEnemies);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal dungeon AI systems to determine
    optimal target priority. The implementation may consider player class-specific
    abilities and gear when assigning targets. Method should be called during appropriate
    encounter phases to ensure valid targeting.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could cause undefined behavior. The enemy count parameter
    must accurately reflect current encounter state for proper target assignment.
