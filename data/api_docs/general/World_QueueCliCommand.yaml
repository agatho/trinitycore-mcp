  class: World
  method: QueueCliCommand
  signature: void World::QueueCliCommand(CliCommandHolder * commandHolder)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a CLI command for execution by the world thread.
  description: The QueueCliCommand method schedules a CliCommandHolder object to be
    executed asynchronously by the World thread. This allows CLI commands to be processed
    without blocking the main game loop. The method is typically used internally by
    the TrinityCore system when commands are received from connected clients or administrative
    interfaces. Commands are queued in a thread-safe manner and will be executed in
    the order they were submitted. The method does not return any value as it only
    initiates the queuing process.
  parameters:
  - name: commandHolder
    description: Pointer to a CliCommandHolder object containing the command to be
      queued for execution. This object must be properly initialized with command
      data before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CLI Command Queueing
    code: 'CliCommandHolder* holder = new CliCommandHolder("reload all", nullptr,
      "admin", 0);

      world->QueueCliCommand(holder);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates in a thread-safe manner and is designed to handle concurrent
    access from multiple threads. The actual command execution occurs asynchronously
    on the World thread, which may introduce a slight delay between queuing and execution.
    The CliCommandHolder object should not be deleted immediately after calling this
    method as it will be managed by the World system.
