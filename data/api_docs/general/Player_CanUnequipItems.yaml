documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player can unequip items based on inventory constraints and item
    requirements
  description: The CanUnequipItems method evaluates whether a player can unequip specific
    items from their inventory, taking into account various game mechanics such as
    item restrictions, inventory space availability, and equipment slot requirements.
    This method is typically used to validate potential unequipping actions before
    proceeding with actual unequipping operations. It returns an integer value indicating
    the success or failure of the unequipping operation, where positive values usually
    signify successful unequipping while negative values indicate errors or constraints
    preventing the action.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: The item ID to check for unequipping. This represents the unique
      identifier of an item in the game database.
  - name: count
    description: The number of items to attempt unequipping. This parameter specifies
      how many instances of the item should be considered for unequipping.
  returns: Returns a positive integer value indicating successful unequipping, or
    negative values representing errors or constraints preventing the action. The
    exact meaning depends on the specific implementation and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unequipping Check
    code: "int result = player->CanUnequipItems(12345, 1);\nif (result > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Item can be unequipped\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item cannot be unequipped\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely checks against inventory
    constraints, equipment slot availability, and item requirements before allowing
    unequipping. Performance considerations may include checking inventory space and
    item restrictions efficiently.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for unequipping items without
    proper validation; it's designed to check feasibility rather than perform actual
    unequipping operations.
