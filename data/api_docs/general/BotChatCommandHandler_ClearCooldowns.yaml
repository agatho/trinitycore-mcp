  method: ClearCooldowns
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::ClearCooldowns(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all cooldowns for a specified player bot
  description: The ClearCooldowns method removes all active cooldowns from a player
    bot identified by its GUID. This functionality is typically used in automated
    bot systems to reset cooldown states, allowing bots to immediately use abilities
    or items that would otherwise be restricted by cooldown timers. The method operates
    on the player's cooldown data within the TrinityCore framework, ensuring that
    subsequent ability usage is not delayed by previous cooldown restrictions. This
    is particularly useful for testing, debugging, or implementing custom bot behaviors
    where cooldowns should be bypassed.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player bot whose cooldowns are
      to be cleared. Must correspond to a valid player entity in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear cooldowns for a specific bot
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      handler.ClearCooldowns(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal cooldown tracking system of
    TrinityCore. It should be used carefully to avoid unintended side effects in gameplay
    mechanics. The operation is performed synchronously and may impact performance
    if called frequently for many bots simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or invalid player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the player bot exists before invoking
    this method. This action bypasses normal cooldown restrictions, which could be
    exploited in inappropriate game scenarios.
