  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetTypeBySlot
  signature: uint8 ArenaTeam::GetTypeBySlot(uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena team type associated with the given slot index.
  description: The GetTypeBySlot method returns the arena team type (e.g., 2v2, 3v3,
    5v5) corresponding to a specific slot within the arena team system. This method
    is typically used to determine the bracket or format of an arena team based on
    its position in the internal arena team array. The slot parameter represents the
    index of the arena team entry, and the returned value indicates the type of arena
    match (2v2 = 1, 3v3 = 2, 5v5 = 3). This functionality is essential for managing
    and identifying different types of arena teams within the game's matchmaking and
    roster systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 value representing the arena team type. Possible values are: 1
    for 2v2, 2 for 3v3, and 3 for 5v5. Returns 0 if the slot is invalid or no team
    exists at that index.'
  examples:
  - title: Get Arena Team Type by Slot
    code: "uint8 teamType = arenaTeam->GetTypeBySlot(0);\nif (teamType == 1)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle 2v2 team\n}\nelse if (teamType == 2)\n{\n    // Handle 3v3 team\n\
      }\nelse if (teamType == 3)\n{\n    // Handle 5v5 team\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that arena teams are stored in a sequential array or
    list where each slot corresponds to a specific arena type. The implementation
    likely relies on internal data structures that map slots to team types, and may
    throw an assertion or return an error if the slot index is out of bounds.
  warnings: Ensure that the slot parameter passed to this method is valid and within
    expected range to avoid undefined behavior. This method should not be called with
    invalid indices unless proper bounds checking is implemented in the calling code.
