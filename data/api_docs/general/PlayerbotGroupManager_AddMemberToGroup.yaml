  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: AddMemberToGroup
  signature: bool PlayerbotGroupManager::AddMemberToGroup(uint32 groupId, Player *
    member, GroupRole preferredRole)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player member to a specified group with a preferred role.
  description: The AddMemberToGroup method attempts to add a given player to a specific
    group within the playerbot system. It assigns the player to the group based on
    the provided group ID and sets their preferred role within that group. This method
    is typically used in bot management systems where players are organized into groups
    for coordinated actions or quests. The method returns true if the addition was
    successful, false otherwise. It may fail if the group does not exist, the member
    is already in a group, or if there are insufficient permissions to modify the
    group.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the target group to which the player will
      be added. Must correspond to an existing group in the system.
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be added to the group. Must
      be a valid player instance and not null.
  - name: preferredRole
    description: The GroupRole enum value indicating the preferred role for the member
      within the group. This determines how the bot will behave in group activities
      such as tanking, healing, or DPS.
  returns: True if the player was successfully added to the group with the specified
    role; false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, existing membership,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddMemberToGroup
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nuint32 groupId =\
      \ 1;\nGroupRole role = GROUP_ROLE_TANK;\nbool success = botGroupManager->AddMemberToGroup(groupId,\
      \ player, role);\nif (success) {\n    // Player successfully added to group\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple players to a group
    code: "std::vector<Player*> players = {player1, player2, player3};\nuint32 groupId\
      \ = 5;\nfor (Player* player : players) {\n    if (!botGroupManager->AddMemberToGroup(groupId,\
      \ player, GROUP_ROLE_DPS)) {\n        // Handle failure case\n        LOG_ERROR(\"\
      playerbots\", \"Failed to add player {} to group {}\", player->GetName(), groupId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Player object is already initialized and valid.
    The GroupRole parameter should be one of the predefined roles in the GroupRole
    enum, such as GROUP_ROLE_TANK, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, or GROUP_ROLE_DPS. The method
    does not perform automatic group creation; it only adds members to existing groups.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an actual existing group, otherwise
    the method will fail. Also, be cautious when assigning roles since incorrect role
    assignments may lead to inefficient bot behavior in group activities.
