documentation:
  brief: Compares two TriggerResult objects for ordering in a sorted container.
  description: The operator() method of TriggerResultComparator is a comparison function
    object used to define the ordering of TriggerResult instances. It typically implements
    a strict weak ordering that allows TriggerResult objects to be sorted or stored
    in associative containers like std::set or std::map. This comparator is commonly
    used within TrinityCore's trigger system to manage and sort trigger events based
    on their properties, such as priority, timestamp, or other relevant criteria.
    The method returns true if the first argument should appear before the second
    argument in the sorted sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the first TriggerResult 'a' should be ordered before the
    second TriggerResult 'b'; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Using TriggerResultComparator with std::set
    code: 'std::set<TriggerResult, TriggerResultComparator> triggerSet;

      TriggerResult result1, result2;

      // Inserting elements will automatically sort them using the comparator

      triggerSet.insert(result1);

      triggerSet.insert(result2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's trigger management
    system. It should not be called directly in most user code unless implementing
    custom sorting logic for trigger results. The actual comparison criteria (e.g.,
    priority, time, ID) are implementation-specific and depend on how TriggerResult
    objects are designed.
