documentation:
  brief: Manages guild bank permissions for a specified player
  description: The ManageGuildBankPermissions method handles the assignment and modification
    of guild bank access rights for a given player. This function is typically invoked
    when a player's guild rank or role changes, affecting their ability to withdraw,
    deposit, or manage items within the guild bank. The method likely checks the player's
    current guild membership status, their assigned permissions level, and updates
    internal data structures accordingly. It may also trigger synchronization events
    to ensure all connected clients reflect the updated permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permission Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageGuildBankPermissions(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild data structures and may
    require the player to be currently logged in. The implementation might involve
    database synchronization and network communication to update all connected clients.
  warnings: Improper handling of player GUIDs or failure to validate permissions can
    lead to unauthorized access to guild bank items. This function should only be
    called after verifying that the player is a valid guild member.
