  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: ResetStatistics
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::ResetStatistics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Resets farming statistics for a specified player.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all farming-related data and progress
    for a given player identified by their GUID. This includes resetting crop counts,
    harvest records, and any other farming-specific metrics stored in the database
    or in-memory structures. The operation is typically invoked when a player's farming
    data needs to be cleared, such as during account transfers, data cleanup, or administrative
    resets. The method ensures that all relevant statistics are wiped clean while
    preserving the player's core account information.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose farming statistics
      will be reset. This value must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 playerId = 12345;

      coordinator.ResetStatistics(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with both database storage and in-memory caching
    systems to ensure consistency across all farming-related data. It may also trigger
    notifications or events to update client-side UI elements.
