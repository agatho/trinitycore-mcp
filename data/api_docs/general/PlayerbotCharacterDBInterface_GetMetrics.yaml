  signature: const Metrics & PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the metrics data structure associated with the player bot character.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a Metrics object that contains
    performance and behavioral statistics for a specific player bot character. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore's playerbot system to retrieve
    diagnostic information about how a bot is performing in terms of actions, decisions,
    and resource usage. The returned reference points to internal data managed by
    the database interface, ensuring consistency with the current state of the bot's
    metrics. This method does not modify any data but solely provides read access
    to the metrics structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Metrics object containing statistical and performance
    data for the player bot character. The Metrics object includes information such
    as action counts, decision timestamps, and other relevant behavioral indicators
    that help in analyzing bot performance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Bot Metrics
    code: 'const Metrics& metrics = playerbot->GetMetrics();

      uint32 actionCount = metrics.actionCount;

      uint32 decisionCount = metrics.decisionCount;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Metrics object is managed internally by the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    and should not be modified directly. Accessing this data structure is thread-safe
    as long as no concurrent modifications occur. The metrics are updated periodically
    during bot operation, so repeated calls may return different values.
  warnings: Do not store the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    instance, as it may become invalid. Avoid modifying the Metrics object through
    this reference, as it could lead to inconsistent internal state or data corruption.
