  class: FleeingMovementGenerator
  method: GetPoint
  signature: void FleeingMovementGenerator::GetPoint(int * owner, Position & position)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and sets a flee point position for the fleeing movement generator.
  description: The GetPoint method computes a valid flee destination point for an
    AI-controlled unit that is fleeing from its current position. This method is typically
    invoked during the fleeing movement generation process to determine where the
    unit should move next to escape from an enemy or threat. It calculates a suitable
    position that is at a certain distance away from the owner's current location,
    taking into account the unit's movement capabilities and environmental constraints
    such as terrain and obstacles. The calculated point is then stored in the provided
    Position object for use in pathfinding and movement execution.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the fleeing
      unit or owner. This value is used to determine the starting position from which
      the flee point is calculated.
  - name: position
    description: Reference to a Position object where the calculated flee destination
      will be stored. The method modifies this object to contain the x, y, z coordinates
      of the computed flee point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement
    code: 'int ownerId = 12345;

      Position fleePoint;

      FleeingMovementGenerator fleeingGen;

      fleeingGen.GetPoint(&ownerId, fleePoint);

      // fleePoint now contains the calculated flee destination coordinates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with movement system
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateFleeMovement() {\n        int\
      \ ownerGuid = GetOwner()->GetGUID();\n        Position fleePos;\n        fleeingGenerator.GetPoint(&ownerGuid,\
      \ fleePos);\n        \n        // Use fleePos to initiate movement\n       \
      \ MoveTo(fleePos);  \n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and should only be called
    during active fleeing behavior. The actual flee point calculation may vary based
    on unit type, threat level, and environmental factors. The method assumes that
    the owner parameter points to a valid entity with accessible position data.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a fleeing movement context as it may
    produce incorrect results or cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the 'owner'
    parameter points to a valid object before calling to prevent segmentation faults.
