  class: EquipmentManager
  method: ~EquipmentManager
  signature: void EquipmentManager::~EquipmentManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the EquipmentManager instance and cleans up associated equipment
    data.
  description: The EquipmentManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all equipment-related resources when an EquipmentManager instance is destroyed.
    This includes releasing any allocated memory for equipment sets, clearing internal
    equipment caches, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor typically
    ensures that character equipment state is properly handled during player logout,
    creature death, or when an EquipmentManager object goes out of scope. The method
    performs necessary cleanup operations to maintain system stability and prevent
    resource leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of EquipmentManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    EquipmentManager* manager = new EquipmentManager();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete manager; // Destructor automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an EquipmentManager object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method
    should not be called directly unless you have a specific reason, as it's part
    of the standard C++ object lifecycle management.
