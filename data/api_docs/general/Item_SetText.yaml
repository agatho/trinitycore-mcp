  class: Item
  method: SetText
  signature: void Item::SetText(const std::string & text)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the text content of the item's book page.
  description: This method assigns a string value to the item's text field, which
    is typically used for books or items that contain textual content. The text can
    represent the content of a book page, quest text, or other textual information
    associated with the item. This method allows developers to modify the textual
    content of an item without requiring a database update. It is particularly useful
    when creating custom items or modifying existing ones with textual content.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: The string value representing the text content to be set on the item.
      This can include book content, quest text, or any other textual information
      associated with the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Book Text
    code: 'Item* item = Item::CreateItem(12345);

      item->SetText("This is a book page text content.");

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the item's text field, which means it affects
    the item's internal state. This operation should be used carefully as it may impact
    game mechanics related to item usage or quest completion. The text content is
    typically stored in the item's database fields and may require a database update
    for persistence.
  warnings: This method does not validate the text content, so developers must ensure
    that the text is appropriate for the item type and context. Setting inappropriate
    text content may lead to game-breaking issues or incorrect quest completion.
