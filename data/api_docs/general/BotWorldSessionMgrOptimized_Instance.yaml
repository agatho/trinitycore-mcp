documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's bot system to access
    the global session management functionality that handles world sessions for bot
    characters. The returned reference provides access to all session-related operations
    such as adding, removing, and managing bot world sessions. This pattern is essential
    for maintaining consistent state and avoiding resource conflicts when multiple
    parts of the codebase need to interact with the same session manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance. The method
    never returns null as it's implemented as a singleton with guaranteed instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized& sessionManager = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();

      // Use sessionManager to access bot session functionality

      sessionManager.AddBotSession(botSession);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance in a bot management context
    code: "void HandleBotLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized&\
      \ manager = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = manager.GetSessionForPlayer(player);\n    if (session)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Process bot session\n        manager.UpdateBotSession(session);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is created during application
    startup and accessed through a static reference. The implementation follows standard
    singleton patterns used throughout TrinityCore's architecture for session management
    components.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances manually
    or bypassing this method to ensure consistent behavior across the bot system.
    Modifying the singleton instance in one part of the code may affect all other
    components that rely on it.
