documentation:
  brief: Updates the protection shield tracker state and handles shield-related logic.
  description: The Update method in ProtectionShieldTracker is responsible for maintaining
    and processing the state of protective shields applied to a unit. This method
    typically runs on each game tick and evaluates active shield effects, updates
    their duration, reduces damage taken, and manages shield removal or transfer when
    conditions are met. It integrates with the combat system to ensure proper shield
    behavior during damage events and player actions. The method does not require
    any external parameters as it operates on internal tracker state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'ProtectionShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(); // Updates shield state internally'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked by the game's main update loop or triggered
    by combat events. It may perform calculations related to damage absorption, shield
    decay, and effect expiration. Developers should ensure that shield effects are
    properly initialized before calling Update.
