  method: ShouldUseBladestorm
  signature: bool ArmsWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseBladestorm() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Arms Warrior should use Bladestorm ability based on
    current combat state and resource levels.
  description: This method evaluates various conditions to decide if the Arms Warrior
    should activate the Bladestorm ability. It considers factors such as available
    rage, number of targets in melee range, and current combat situation. The decision
    is made within the context of the warrior's specialization and current gameplay
    state. This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making process
    to determine optimal spell usage for maximum damage output.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Bladestorm should be used, false otherwise. The decision
    is based on combat conditions such as target count, rage availability, and current
    threat level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warrior->ShouldUseBladestorm()) {\n    warrior->CastSpell(BLADESTORM_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::DoCombatAction() {\n    if (ShouldUseBladestorm())\
      \ {\n        // Execute Bladestorm\n        CastSpell(BLADESTORM_SPELL_ID);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with other combat actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks for minimum rage requirements and target count
    thresholds. The implementation may vary based on the specific version of TrinityCore
    and patch updates. Performance impact is minimal as it only performs boolean evaluations
    and simple comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in situations where spell casting
    is prohibited or when the warrior is in an invalid state (e.g., stunned, feared).
    Calling this method without proper context may result in inappropriate ability
    usage.
