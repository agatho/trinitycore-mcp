  method: ClearExtraScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ClearExtraScaleCurve()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the extra scale curve data associated with the area trigger.
  description: The ClearExtraScaleCurve method removes any previously set extra scale
    curve data from the AreaTrigger instance. This operation resets the scaling behavior
    of the area trigger's visual effects or animations that are controlled by a curve.
    The method is typically used when the area trigger needs to be reset to its default
    scale state, or when transitioning between different animation states where the
    previous curve data should no longer apply. It ensures that subsequent operations
    on the area trigger do not inadvertently use outdated scaling curves.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Area Trigger Scale Curve
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->ClearExtraScaleCurve();

      // The area trigger now uses default scaling behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the visual representation of the area trigger.
    It should be called before applying new scale curve data to ensure clean state
    management. The operation is immediate and does not require additional processing
    or synchronization.
