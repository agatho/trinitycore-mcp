  class: GuildBankManager
  method: AutoOrganizeGuildBank
  signature: void GuildBankManager::AutoOrganizeGuildBank(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically organizes the guild bank items based on predefined sorting
    rules and item types.
  description: The AutoOrganizeGuildBank method reorganizes the contents of a guild's
    bank vault by sorting items according to predefined rules such as item type, quality,
    and other categorization criteria. This function ensures that guild members can
    easily locate items within the bank, improving overall usability and efficiency.
    The method typically runs when a player triggers the auto-organize feature in
    the guild bank interface or when specific conditions are met within the game's
    internal logic. It may also be invoked programmatically by other systems or scripts
    to maintain consistent organization of the guild's inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who initiated the auto-organize request. This parameter is used to validate
      permissions and track which player triggered the operation.
  returns: None. The method performs its operations directly on the guild bank data
    without returning any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AutoOrganizeGuildBank
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager* guildBankMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildBankManager();

      guildBankMgr->AutoOrganizeGuildBank(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the context of a player's interaction
    with the guild bank UI. It modifies the internal state of the guild bank and may
    trigger updates to client-side displays. The organization rules are defined by
    the game's configuration and may vary between different server settings or expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    member of a guild with sufficient permissions to modify the guild bank. Invoking
    this method without proper validation could lead to unexpected behavior or access
    violations.
