  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: AdjustForMechanics
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::AdjustForMechanics(Player * bot, const
    int & dangerZones)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the bot's positioning based on combat mechanics and danger zones.
  description: The AdjustForMechanics method modifies a bot's position in response
    to combat-related environmental factors and threat levels. It evaluates the player's
    current location, nearby hazards, and role-specific positioning requirements to
    determine optimal movement or adjustment strategies. This method is typically
    invoked during combat scenarios where positioning significantly impacts survival
    and effectiveness. The function considers the dangerZones parameter to assess
    risk levels and adapt behavior accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose positioning
      will be adjusted. Must not be null.
  - name: dangerZones
    description: Integer value indicating the number or severity level of danger zones
      in the current area. Used to determine how aggressively the bot should adjust
      its position.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: "void MyCombatAI::Update()\n{\n    Player* player = GetBot();\n    int dangerLevel\
      \ = GetDangerZoneCount();\n    RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;\n   \
      \ positioning.AdjustForMechanics(player, dangerLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic threat assessment
    code: "void AdvancedCombatManager::HandleCombat()\n{\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n\
      \    int dangerZones = CalculateDangerZones();\n    if (dangerZones > 0)\n \
      \   {\n        RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;\n        positioning.AdjustForMechanics(bot,\
      \ dangerZones);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the role-based combat AI system and should only be
    called during active combat situations. The implementation likely involves pathfinding
    algorithms to determine safe positioning while maintaining optimal engagement
    distance.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this function, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, avoid calling
    this method too frequently in rapid succession as it may impact performance.
