documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistical tracking data within the position strategy base class.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and initializes all internal statistics
    tracking variables within the PositionStrategyBase class. This method is typically
    invoked when a new positioning strategy session begins or when existing statistical
    data needs to be cleared to avoid carryover effects between different scenarios.
    The method ensures that all counters, accumulators, and tracking metrics are reset
    to their default initial states, allowing for clean statistical analysis of position-related
    data. It does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new PositionStrategyBase();

      strategy->ResetStats();

      // Statistics are now reset to initial state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI pathfinding and positioning systems where
    statistical data about movement patterns, distances, or angles needs to be tracked
    and then cleared for new calculations. It's important to call this method before
    starting a new analysis cycle to ensure accurate results.
