  signature: void SoloCombatStrategy::InitializeActions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the actions and behavior for solo combat strategies in the AI
    system.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up all necessary action nodes, priorities,
    and decision-making logic for a SoloCombatStrategy instance. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI behavior tree to configure how
    a player or NPC should act when engaged in single-target combat. It establishes
    the core combat actions such as melee attacks, spell casting, movement patterns,
    and defensive behaviors based on the character's class, level, and equipped gear.
    The method ensures that all required action nodes are properly registered with
    the AI context and that their priorities are correctly set to enable effective
    solo combat decision-making.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SoloCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeActions();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in solo combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a SoloCombatStrategy
    object. Repeated calls may result in duplicate action nodes or unexpected behavior.
    The method relies on the AI context being properly set up before execution.
