  class: LootDistribution
  method: SetGroupLootMethod
  signature: void LootDistribution::SetGroupLootMethod(Group * group, int method)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot distribution method for a specified group in the game.
  description: The SetGroupLootMethod function configures the loot distribution behavior
    for a given group within the World of Warcraft instance. This method determines
    how loot items are distributed among group members, such as using free-for-all,
    round-robin, or master loot systems. The function takes a pointer to a Group object
    and an integer representing the desired loot method. It updates the internal state
    of the group's loot settings without returning any value. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining proper game balance and player experience in group-based
    content like dungeons and raids.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the loot method will be set.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid group in the game world.
  - name: method
    description: Integer value specifying the loot distribution method. Valid values
      typically correspond to predefined constants such as 0 (free-for-all), 1 (round-robin),
      or 2 (master loot). The exact mapping depends on the TrinityCore implementation
      and game version.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Master Loot Method for a Group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    LootDistribution::SetGroupLootMethod(myGroup,\
      \ 2); // Set to master loot method\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Group Loot Based on Difficulty
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && player->GetMap()->IsRaid())\n\
      {\n    // For raid content, use master loot\n    LootDistribution::SetGroupLootMethod(raidGroup,\
      \ 2);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // For normal dungeons, use free-for-all\n    LootDistribution::SetGroupLootMethod(raidGroup,\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the group's loot settings and should be called
    carefully to avoid unexpected behavior. The group must be valid and active in
    the game world for this function to work properly. Changes made using this method
    take immediate effect on all group members.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Be cautious when
    changing loot methods during active loot distribution events, as it could disrupt
    ongoing loot rolls.
