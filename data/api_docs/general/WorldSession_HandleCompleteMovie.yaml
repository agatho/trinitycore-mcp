documentation:
  brief: Handles the completion of a movie sequence sent by the client
  description: The HandleCompleteMovie method processes a packet indicating that a
    movie sequence has been completed by the player. This typically occurs when a
    cinematic or in-game movie finishes playing, and the server needs to acknowledge
    the completion and potentially trigger related events or actions. The method is
    part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and is invoked automatically
    when the client sends a CompleteMovie packet. It may be used to unlock achievements,
    advance quest progress, or perform other game state updates that depend on movie
    completion.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCompleteMovie(WorldPackets::Misc::CompleteMovie&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Acknowledge movie completion\n    // Trigger any associated\
      \ quest or achievement events\n    // Update player state accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the WorldSession's message processing
    loop when a CompleteMovie packet is received from a client. It should not be invoked
    directly by other methods unless specifically required for testing or special
    circumstances.
