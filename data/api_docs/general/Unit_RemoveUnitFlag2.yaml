  signature: void Unit::RemoveUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified unit flags from a Unit object
  description: The RemoveUnitFlag2 method removes the specified UnitFlags2 flags from
    a Unit object, effectively clearing those flags from the unit's state. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to manage unit behavior and
    status during gameplay mechanics. The operation affects the unit's internal flag
    state and can influence various game systems such as movement, combat, and interaction
    with other units.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitFlags2 flags to be removed from the unit. This parameter
      specifies which flags should be cleared from the unit's state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;


      // Remove specific flags

      target->RemoveUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);


      // The unit no longer has the flag set'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: '// Assuming a unit with multiple flags set

      Unit* player = new Unit;


      // Remove multiple flags at once

      player->RemoveUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_PVP);

      player->RemoveUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_SILENCED);


      // The unit no longer has these flags set'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and operates on the unit's internal flag state.
    Performance considerations are minimal as it only modifies internal flag values.
    Developers should be aware that removing flags may affect game mechanics such
    as combat behavior or player interaction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in unit interactions,
    especially if flags are removed without proper consideration of their impact on
    gameplay mechanics. Always ensure that flag removal aligns with intended game
    state.
