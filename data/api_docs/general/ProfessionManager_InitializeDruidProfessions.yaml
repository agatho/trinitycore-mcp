  brief: Initializes druid profession abilities and associated data for the player
  description: The InitializeDruidProfessions method sets up all necessary druid profession
    entries, including spell learning, skill levels, and related game mechanics for
    druids within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically called during
    player login or profession initialization to ensure that all druid-specific abilities
    are properly configured in the game world. It handles the setup of druid crafting
    skills, herbalism, skinning, and other druid-related professions that players
    can pursue.

  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    sProfessionManager->InitializeDruidProfessions();\n\
      \    // Additional login logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the player object is fully initialized
    and has valid profession data. The method internally manages spell learning, skill
    point allocation, and profession-specific database entries for druids.
  warnings: Calling this method before player initialization may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required subsystems are initialized before
    invoking this method.
