documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name set identifier associated with this game object model
    owner.
  description: The GetNameSetId method returns a unique uint8 identifier that represents
    the name set configuration for the GameObjectModelOwnerBase instance. This identifier
    is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine which set of names
    should be applied to the game object's model, particularly in scenarios involving
    dynamic naming or localization. The method provides read-only access to an internal
    state variable and does not modify any data. It is commonly used during object
    initialization, name generation, or when applying specific visual or behavioral
    traits based on predefined name sets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the identifier of the name set associated with
    this game object model owner. Valid values are typically in the range 0-255, where
    each value corresponds to a predefined configuration in the game's name set database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint8 nameSetId = gameObjectModelOwner->GetNameSetId();\nif (nameSetId\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Handle default name set\n    printf(\"Using default name\
      \ set\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Name Set
    code: "uint8 id = gameObjectModelOwner->GetNameSetId();\nswitch (id)\n{\n    case\
      \ 1:\n        // Apply special naming rules for set 1\n        break;\n    case\
      \ 2:\n        // Apply different naming rules for set 2\n        break;\n  \
      \  default:\n        // Default handling\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that accesses an internal member variable.
    It should be called frequently as it has no side effects and does not involve
    heavy computation. The returned value is initialized during object construction
    or assignment and remains constant throughout the object's lifetime.
