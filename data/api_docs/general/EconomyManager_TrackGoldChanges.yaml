  brief: Starts tracking gold changes for the economy manager.
  description: The TrackGoldChanges method initializes the process of monitoring and
    recording gold transactions within the economy system. This method is typically
    invoked to begin logging player gold modifications, such as gains from quests,
    loot drops, or purchases, and can be used in conjunction with other economy-related
    functions to maintain accurate financial records. It does not take any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations; instead, it sets internal flags or registers
    callbacks necessary for tracking subsequent gold changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economy = sEconomyMgr;

  notes: This method should be called before any gold modification events occur to
    ensure proper tracking. It may internally register event listeners or enable specific
    tracking mechanisms depending on the implementation details of the EconomyManager
    class.
