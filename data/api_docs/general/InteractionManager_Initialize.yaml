  class: InteractionManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool InteractionManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the interaction manager system, setting up required resources
    and data structures for handling player interactions.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the InteractionManager class for operation
    by allocating necessary memory, registering event handlers, and configuring internal
    state variables. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    the interaction system needs to be reinitialized. It ensures that all dependent
    systems are properly set up before any interaction processing can occur. The method
    performs validation checks on configuration settings and initializes internal
    collections used for tracking active interactions. If initialization fails due
    to missing dependencies or invalid configurations, the method returns false, indicating
    that interaction services may not function correctly until a successful reinitialization
    occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly allocated; returns false if initialization failed due to configuration
    errors, missing dependencies, or resource allocation issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "InteractionManager* interactionMgr = new InteractionManager();\nbool success\
      \ = interactionMgr->Initialize();\nif (success)\n{\n    // Interaction manager\
      \ is ready for use\n    LOG_INFO(\"interaction\", \"Interaction manager initialized\
      \ successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      interaction\", \"Failed to initialize interaction manager.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an InteractionManager
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior. The
    initialization process is not thread-safe and should be performed in a single-threaded
    context during server startup.
  warnings: Calling Initialize after the manager has already been initialized may
    cause memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that all dependencies
    required by the interaction system are available before calling this method.
