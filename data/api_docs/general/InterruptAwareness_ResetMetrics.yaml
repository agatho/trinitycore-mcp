documentation:
  brief: Resets all interrupt-related metrics and counters within the InterruptAwareness
    system.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated interrupt statistics
    and performance data tracked by the InterruptAwareness class. This function is
    typically invoked to reset internal tracking mechanisms, allowing for clean measurement
    of interrupt behavior during specific intervals or events. It ensures that subsequent
    interrupt detection and analysis are based on fresh data rather than historical
    metrics. The method does not require any input parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or before starting new interrupt
    analysis sessions to ensure accurate metric reporting. It is designed to be thread-safe
    and can be safely invoked from any context within the TrinityCore framework.
