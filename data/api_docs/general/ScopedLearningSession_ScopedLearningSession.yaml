  class: ScopedLearningSession
  method: ScopedLearningSession
  signature: void ScopedLearningSession::ScopedLearningSession(uint32_t botGuid, BotAI
    * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new scoped learning session for a bot with the specified GUID
    and AI instance.
  description: The ScopedLearningSession constructor initializes a new learning session
    for a bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal state
    tracking for the bot's AI behavior, allowing it to learn and adapt based on interactions
    and environmental feedback. The session is scoped to the lifetime of the object,
    ensuring proper cleanup when the session ends. It associates the bot's unique
    identifier (GUID) with its AI instance to manage learning processes effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will participate in
      the learning session. This value must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing
      an existing bot in the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance associated with the bot. This parameter
      must not be null and should point to a valid AI object that manages the bot's
      behavior during the learning session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Learning Session
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAI* ai = new BotAI();

      ScopedLearningSession session(botGuid, ai);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when a bot
    begins a new learning phase. The session object should be created on the stack
    to ensure automatic cleanup upon scope exit.
