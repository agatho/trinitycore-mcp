  class: Minion
  method: InitStats
  signature: void Minion::InitStats(int * summoner, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the statistics and properties of a minion summoned by a player.
  description: The InitStats method sets up the initial combat attributes, health,
    mana, and other relevant statistics for a minion creature that has been summoned
    by a player. This method is typically invoked during the creation or activation
    phase of a summoned creature to ensure it has appropriate base stats according
    to the summoner's level and the minion's type. It configures the minion's maximum
    and current health, power values, damage ranges, and other essential combat parameters
    based on the provided summoner reference and duration settings.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to the summoner's data structure or identifier. This parameter
      is used to determine the summoner's level, class, and other relevant attributes
      that influence the minion's initial stats.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the minion will remain active.
      This value affects how long the minion persists and may influence stat calculations
      such as regeneration rates or temporary bonuses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Minion Initialization
    code: 'Minion* pet = new Minion();

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      pet->InitStats(&player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 30000); // Initialize with
      30 second duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after creating a minion object but
    before adding it to the world. It assumes that the summoner parameter points to
    valid data and that the minion's template or type has been properly set.
  warnings: Calling InitStats without proper initialization of the summoner reference
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect stat calculations. Ensure that the
    duration value is appropriate for the intended gameplay experience.
