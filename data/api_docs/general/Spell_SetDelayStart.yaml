  class: Spell
  method: SetDelayStart
  signature: void Spell::SetDelayStart(uint64 m_time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the delay start time for a spell, controlling when the spell execution
    begins after casting.
  description: The SetDelayStart method is used to configure the delay period before
    a spell begins its execution. This method allows developers to control when a
    spell starts its casting process, which is particularly useful for managing spell
    cooldowns and timing in World of Warcraft. The method accepts a uint64 value representing
    the time in milliseconds since the last update, effectively setting the start
    time for the spell's execution. This functionality is essential for implementing
    custom spell behaviors and ensuring proper game mechanics alignment with server-side
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: m_time
    description: The delay start time in milliseconds since the last update. This
      value represents the time when the spell should begin its execution, typically
      used to control cooldowns or timing of spell effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Delay Start for a Spell
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->SetDelayStart(5000);

      // This sets the delay start to 5 seconds from now'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to manage timing and execution of spells. It should be called before the spell
    begins its casting process to ensure proper timing control.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause incorrect spell timing, leading
    to game mechanics issues or unexpected behavior during spell execution. Ensure
    that the time value is properly calculated and represents valid milliseconds since
    last update.
