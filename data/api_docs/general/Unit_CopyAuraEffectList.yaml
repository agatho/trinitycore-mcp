  brief: Copies aura effect list from one unit to another
  description: This method copies a list of aura effects from one unit to another,
    typically used for transferring active effects between units during combat or
    spell mechanics. It handles the copying of individual aura effects and their associated
    data, ensuring proper application of effects on target units. The method is commonly
    used in spell handling systems where effects need to be transferred between different
    units or when applying temporary effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of copied aura effects, indicating how many effects
    were successfully transferred from source to destination
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Unit* target = unit->CopyAuraEffectList(sourceAuraList);
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of individual aura effect copying,
    ensuring proper data transfer between units, and maintaining the integrity of
    effect lists. Performance considerations involve avoiding unnecessary memory allocations
    during copy operations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when copying aura effects as improper handling can
    lead to incorrect application of effects or memory corruption. Ensure source list
    is valid before calling this method.
