  brief: Sets the movie ID for the player, allowing them to view a specific cinematic
    sequence.
  description: The SetMovie method allows a player to display a specific cinematic
    movie by setting its ID. This method is typically used to trigger cinematic sequences
    that are associated with quest events or character storylines. The movie ID corresponds
    to a predefined cinematic sequence in the game's database, and when called, it
    will display the corresponding movie to the player. It's important to note that
    this method does not directly control the playback of the movie itself; instead,
    it sets the movie ID which then triggers the appropriate cinematic sequence.

  - title: Basic usage example

    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other cinematic-related
    methods such as 'PlayMovie' or 'SetMovie'. It's important to understand that setting
    a movie ID does not automatically play it; you must ensure that the appropriate
    cinematic sequence is properly triggered. This method should be used carefully
    during quest progression or character events, as improper usage can lead to unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: The method may cause issues if used outside of proper quest context or
    without appropriate checks. Using this method in inappropriate situations may
    result in missing or incorrect cinematic sequences. Additionally, ensure that
    the movie ID exists in the game's database before calling this method.
