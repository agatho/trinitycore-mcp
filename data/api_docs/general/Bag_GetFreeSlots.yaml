  signature: int Bag::GetFreeSlots() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of free slots available in the bag.
  description: The GetFreeSlots method determines how many empty container slots remain
    within a Bag object. This is essential for inventory management in World of Warcraft,
    as it helps determine whether an item can be added to the bag. The method iterates
    through all slots in the bag and counts those that are currently unoccupied. It's
    commonly used before attempting to add items to ensure there's sufficient space.
    The returned value represents a non-negative integer indicating the count of free
    slots.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of free slots available in the bag.
    A return value of zero indicates that the bag is completely full, while any positive
    integer indicates the number of empty slots remaining.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an item can be added to a bag
    code: "if (bag->GetFreeSlots() > 0) {\n    // Safe to add item\n    player->AddItemToBag(bag,\
      \ item);\n} else {\n    // Bag is full, handle accordingly\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Bag is full!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining optimal bag usage for item placement
    code: "int freeSlots = bag->GetFreeSlots();\nif (freeSlots >= 5) {\n    // Preferably\
      \ use this bag for multiple items\n    player->MoveItemToBag(bag, item);\n}\
      \ else if (freeSlots >= 1) {\n    // Single item can be placed\n    player->AddItemToBag(bag,\
      \ item);\n} else {\n    // No space available\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      No space in bag.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of all container slots to count free ones,
    which may have performance implications for bags with many slots. It is typically
    called during inventory operations and should be used judiciously in performance-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: The method assumes that the bag object is valid and properly initialized.
    Calling this on a null or uninitialized bag could lead to undefined behavior.
    Additionally, free slots may change between the time this method is called and
    when an item is actually added to the bag due to concurrent operations.
