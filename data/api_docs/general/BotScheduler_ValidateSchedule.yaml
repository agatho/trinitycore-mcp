  method: ValidateSchedule
  signature: bool BotScheduler::ValidateSchedule() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates the current bot schedule configuration for correctness and consistency
  description: The ValidateSchedule method checks whether the current bot scheduling
    configuration is valid and consistent. It verifies that all scheduled tasks have
    proper parameters, time constraints are logical, and there are no conflicting
    or malformed entries in the schedule. This method ensures that the bot scheduler
    can safely execute scheduled actions without runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
    The validation typically occurs before attempting to process or apply a new schedule,
    helping maintain system stability and preventing invalid configurations from being
    activated.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the schedule is valid and all configuration parameters
    are correct; returns false if any validation checks fail, indicating an invalid
    or inconsistent schedule configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Schedule Validation
    code: "if (botScheduler.ValidateSchedule()) {\n    // Proceed with scheduling\n\
      \    botScheduler.ApplySchedule();\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid schedule\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Invalid bot schedule detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs comprehensive validation of all scheduled entries and
    should be called before any schedule activation. The validation includes checking
    time ranges, task existence, parameter completeness, and logical consistency between
    different schedule components.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured scheduler
    may lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure the scheduler has valid data before
    invoking validation.
