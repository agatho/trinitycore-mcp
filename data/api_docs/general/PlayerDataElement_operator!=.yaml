documentation:
  brief: Compares two PlayerDataElement objects for inequality and returns true if
    they are not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this PlayerDataElement
    instance and another PlayerDataElement object to determine if they are not equivalent.
    It typically compares internal data members such as GUID, name, level, or other
    identifying characteristics of the player data element. This comparison is essential
    for sorting, filtering, or determining distinct player entries in various game
    systems like player lists, guild management, or database synchronization. The
    method follows standard C++ operator overloading conventions and returns a boolean
    value indicating whether the two objects differ in any significant way.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The PlayerDataElement object to compare against this instance for
      inequality.
  returns: Returns true if the current PlayerDataElement object is not equal to the
    right operand; otherwise returns false. The comparison considers all relevant
    fields of the PlayerDataElement structure to determine equality or inequality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'PlayerDataElement player1;

      PlayerDataElement player2;

      bool result = (player1 != player2); // Returns true if player data differs'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player1 != player2) {\n    // Handle case where players have different\
      \ data\n    std::cout << \"Players are not the same\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Players have identical data\n    std::cout << \"Players are identical\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a deep comparison of all relevant
    fields within the PlayerDataElement structure. It's important to note that this
    method may be used in STL containers or algorithms that require equality comparisons,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when comparing large
    data structures.
