  method: ParseAdditionalData
  signature: Result InstanceScriptDataReader::ParseAdditionalData()
documentation:
  brief: Parses additional data for instance scripts and returns the parsing result.
  description: The ParseAdditionalData method processes supplementary data that may
    be associated with an instance script, typically used to initialize or configure
    specific aspects of a dungeon or raid encounter. This method is commonly invoked
    during the loading phase of an instance to ensure all required data is correctly
    interpreted and applied. It handles parsing of serialized data such as boss states,
    event timers, or custom configuration values that are stored in the database or
    loaded from external sources. The method returns a Result object indicating whether
    the parsing was successful or if any errors occurred during the process.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Result object indicating the success or failure of the parsing operation.
    A successful parse typically returns a positive result code, while an error may
    return a specific error code or indicate missing data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n\n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n \
      \       if (ParseAdditionalData().IsOk())\n        {\n            // Additional\
      \ data parsed successfully\n        }\n        else\n        {\n           \
      \ // Handle parsing error\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the instance initialization phase
    and should not be invoked after the instance has been fully loaded. The data being
    parsed may include serialized state information that must match expected formats
    to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Improperly formatted additional data can cause parsing failures, potentially
    leading to incorrect instance behavior or crashes. Ensure all data structures
    conform to expected schemas before calling this method.
