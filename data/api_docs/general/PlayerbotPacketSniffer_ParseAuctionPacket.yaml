  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseAuctionPacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseAuctionPacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Parses auction house packets to extract and process relevant data for player
    bot behavior.
  description: The ParseAuctionPacket method is responsible for intercepting and analyzing
    incoming auction house-related packets from the WorldSession. It processes these
    packets to gather information about auctions, such as item listings, bid amounts,
    and auction durations, which are then used by player bots to make informed decisions
    regarding bidding, listing items, or managing their inventory. This method plays
    a crucial role in enabling bot automation for auction house interactions within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      from which the packet originates. Used to identify the player and context of
      the auction activity.
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPacket containing the raw auction house data. This packet
      may represent various auction actions such as listing an item, placing a bid,
      or retrieving auction information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Parsing Example
    code: "void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseAuctionPacket(WorldSession* session,\
      \ const WorldPacket& packet) {\n    // Extract auction data from the packet\n\
      \    uint32 opcode = packet.GetOpcode();\n    if (opcode == SMSG_AUCTION_LIST_OWNER_ITEMS)\
      \ {\n        // Process owner item listings\n        ParseOwnerItems(session,\
      \ packet);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the packet handling system when an auction-related
    opcode is received. Developers should ensure that all packet data is properly
    validated before processing to avoid potential exploits or crashes.
  warnings: Improper handling of auction packets may lead to incorrect bot behavior,
    including invalid bidding or listing actions. Always verify packet contents and
    session state before parsing auction data.
