documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes player permissions for the session
  description: The LoadPermissions method retrieves and applies permission levels
    and privileges for the currently authenticated player session. This method typically
    executes during session initialization or login process to ensure the player has
    appropriate access rights to game features, commands, and content. It reads permission
    data from the database or cache and sets internal session flags that control what
    actions the player can perform within the World of Warcraft client. The permissions
    loaded may include command access levels, zone restrictions, and other privilege-based
    restrictions that affect gameplay behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during session initialization
    code: "void SessionInitializer::InitializePlayerSession(WorldSession* session)\n\
      {\n    // ... authentication logic ...\n    session->LoadPermissions();\n  \
      \  // Permissions are now loaded and active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during the login sequence by
    TrinityCore's authentication system. The permissions are cached per session to
    avoid repeated database queries. Developers should not call this method manually
    unless implementing custom permission systems or debugging permission-related
    issues.
  warnings: Calling LoadPermissions manually while a player is already in-game may
    cause unexpected behavior or privilege inconsistencies. This method should only
    be invoked during session initialization or when explicitly managing permission
    states for testing purposes.
