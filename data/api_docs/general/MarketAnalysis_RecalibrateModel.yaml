  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: RecalibrateModel
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::RecalibrateModel(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Recomputes and updates the market analysis model for a specified item based
    on current auction data.
  description: The RecalibrateModel method recalculates the market analysis model
    for the given item ID by processing recent auction house data. This includes updating
    price trends, demand indicators, and other economic metrics that influence the
    item's market behavior. The method typically runs asynchronously to avoid blocking
    the main game loop and may trigger additional events or notifications when the
    recalibration is complete. It is designed to maintain an accurate representation
    of in-game market dynamics for the specified item.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the market model should
      be recalibrated. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis* analysis = sWorld->GetMarketAnalysis();

      analysis->RecalibrateModel(12345); // Recalibrates model for item ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "MarketAnalysis* analysis = sWorld->GetMarketAnalysis();\nif (analysis)\n\
      {\n    analysis->RecalibrateModel(98765);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where\
      \ market analysis is not initialized\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries and should be used judiciously to
    prevent performance degradation. It is typically called during periodic maintenance
    or when significant auction activity occurs for the specified item.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the itemId corresponds to an existing item in the game's
    database before invoking this function.
