  class: PetStable
  method: GetCurrentActivePetIndex
  signature: int PetStable::GetCurrentActivePetIndex() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the index of the currently active pet in the stable.
  description: The GetCurrentActivePetIndex method returns the zero-based index of
    the currently active pet within the PetStable's internal pet list. This index
    is used to identify which pet is currently summoned and controlled by the player.
    The method does not perform any validation on whether a pet is actually active
    or valid, it simply returns the stored index value. In World of Warcraft's context,
    this corresponds to the pet that would be returned by functions like GetActivePet()
    or similar gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the zero-based index of the currently active pet
    in the stable's pet list. Returns -1 if no pet is currently active or if the stable
    contains no pets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PetStable* stable = player->GetPetStable();\nint activeIndex = stable->GetCurrentActivePetIndex();\n\
      if (activeIndex >= 0) {\n    // A pet is currently active\n    Pet* activePet\
      \ = stable->GetPet(activeIndex);\n    // Use the active pet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PetStable maintains an internal state of which
    pet is currently active. The index returned should be used carefully as it may
    not reflect the actual in-game pet status if the stable's state has been modified
    externally.
  warnings: The return value of -1 does not necessarily indicate an error condition,
    but rather that no pet is currently active. Always validate the return value before
    using it to access pets in the stable.
