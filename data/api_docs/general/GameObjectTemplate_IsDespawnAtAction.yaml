documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is set to despawn when an action occurs.
  description: The IsDespawnAtAction method checks if the GameObjectTemplate is configured
    to automatically despawn when a specific action event takes place. This functionality
    is commonly used for temporary interactive objects such as doors, chests, or quest-related
    items that should disappear after being activated. The method returns true if
    the object has this behavior enabled, and false otherwise. This check is typically
    performed during game logic execution when an action is triggered on the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object is configured to despawn upon action activation;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject despawns on action
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate->IsDespawnAtAction()) {\n    // Handle logic for object that\
      \ despawns after action\n    printf(\"This object will despawn after being activated.\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle logic for persistent object\n    printf(\"This\
      \ object remains after activation.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The behavior of this method is determined by the GameObject's template data
    in the database, specifically related to the 'despawn_at_action' flag or equivalent
    configuration field. This check is performed frequently during gameplay when objects
    are interacted with, so performance should be considered for high-frequency interactions.
