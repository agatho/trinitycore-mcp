api:
  class: CreatureAI
  method: OnGossipHello
  signature: bool CreatureAI::OnGossipHello(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the initial gossip interaction when a player interacts with a creature.
  description: The OnGossipHello method is invoked when a player initiates a gossip
    interaction with a creature, typically triggered by clicking on the creature's
    gossip icon. This method allows the AI to define the initial response or menu
    presented to the player. It serves as the entry point for custom gossip functionality
    and can be used to display options, trigger quests, or perform other actions based
    on the player's interaction. The method should return true if the gossip was handled
    successfully, or false if the default behavior should proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that represents the player's GUID (Global Unique
      Identifier) who initiated the gossip interaction.
  returns: Returns true if the gossip interaction was handled successfully and the
    custom menu or response should be displayed. Returns false to allow default behavior,
    such as showing standard gossip options or proceeding with normal interaction
    flow.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Hello Implementation
    code: "bool CreatureAI::OnGossipHello(int* param0)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ *param0));\n    if (!player)\n        return false;\n\n    AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"I want to see my quests.\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n\
      \    AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Nevermind.\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN,\
      \ 2);\n    SendGossipMenuFor(player, DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE, GetCreature()->GetGUID());\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI system and is typically overridden
    in custom AI implementations. It's important to ensure that the player object
    exists before attempting to interact with it, as the GUID passed may not always
    be valid. The method should generally avoid long-running operations or blocking
    calls.
  warnings: Ensure that you properly validate the player GUID before using it. Incorrect
    handling of invalid GUIDs can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also, remember
    that returning false allows default gossip behavior, which might override your
    custom implementation.
