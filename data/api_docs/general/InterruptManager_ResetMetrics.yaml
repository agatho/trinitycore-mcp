documentation:
  brief: Resets all interrupt-related performance metrics and counters within the
    InterruptManager.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated interrupt-related statistics
    and performance data stored within the InterruptManager instance. This function
    is typically used to reset tracking data for monitoring or testing purposes, ensuring
    that subsequent measurements start from a clean state. The method does not affect
    the operational state of interrupts themselves, but rather resets the internal
    accounting of how many interrupts have occurred and their associated timing data.
    It's commonly called during system initialization, performance testing, or when
    resetting diagnostic information.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptManager();

      manager->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve clearing internal data structures that could impact real-time monitoring.
    It's recommended to call this only during appropriate maintenance windows or initialization
    phases.
