  signature: const BotUpdateMetrics * BotPriorityManager::GetMetrics(int botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the update metrics for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The GetMetrics method retrieves a pointer to the BotUpdateMetrics structure
    associated with a given bot GUID. This structure contains performance and update-related
    statistics for the bot, such as processing times, update frequencies, and other
    diagnostic information. The method is typically used for monitoring or debugging
    purposes within the TrinityCore AI system. It assumes that the bot with the specified
    GUID exists in the system's tracking structures. If the bot does not exist or
    has not been initialized, the method may return a null pointer or an invalid metrics
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a BotUpdateMetrics object for the specified bot.
    Returns nullptr if no bot with the given GUID is found or if the metrics are not
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log bot update metrics
    code: "const BotUpdateMetrics* metrics = botPriorityManager->GetMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (metrics != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot Update Time: \" << metrics->lastUpdateTime\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No metrics found for bot 12345\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotPriorityManager and is intended to be used
    in conjunction with other AI-related systems. It is recommended to check for null
    returns before dereferencing the returned pointer to avoid access violations.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent bot GUID may result in a null return
    value, which must be handled appropriately to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
