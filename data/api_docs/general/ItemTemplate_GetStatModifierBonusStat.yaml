documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bonus stat value at the specified index from the item's stat
    modifiers.
  description: The GetStatModifierBonusStat method retrieves the bonus stat value
    associated with a specific index in an item's stat modifier list. This method
    is typically used to access individual stat bonuses that are applied to items,
    such as strength, agility, or intellect bonuses. The index parameter determines
    which stat modifier to retrieve from the internal array of stat modifiers. This
    functionality is crucial for calculating total item stats and applying bonuses
    during gameplay. The method assumes that the provided index is valid and within
    the bounds of the item's stat modifier array.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the bonus stat value at the specified
    index. A negative value may indicate a penalty, while zero typically means no
    bonus or penalty for that stat. The method returns 0 if the index is out of bounds
    or if there are no stat modifiers defined.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Bonus Strength from Item
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    int32 bonusStrength = itemTemplate->GetStatModifierBonusStat(0); // Get\
      \ first stat modifier\n    if (bonusStrength > 0)\n        printf(\"Item provides\
      \ %d bonus strength\\n\", bonusStrength);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ItemTemplate class which represents the base template
    data for items in TrinityCore. The stat modifiers are typically loaded from database
    entries and may include various bonuses like attack power, spell power, resilience,
    etc. The index corresponds to the order in which stat modifiers are defined in
    the item's template data.
  warnings: Ensure that the index passed to this method is valid and within the range
    of available stat modifiers. Passing an invalid index may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect values. This method should only be called on properly initialized
    ItemTemplate objects.
