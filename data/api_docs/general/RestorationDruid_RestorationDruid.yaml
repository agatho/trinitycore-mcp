  class: RestorationDruid
  method: RestorationDruid
  signature: void RestorationDruid::RestorationDruid(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Restoration Druid AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The RestorationDruid constructor initializes a new instance of the
    RestorationDruid AI class, setting up the bot's behavior and capabilities based
    on the provided Player object. This method configures the AI to perform restoration-based
    druid activities such as healing, mana management, and spell selection tailored
    for a restoration druid role. The initialization process includes setting up the
    bot's target selection logic, spell casting priorities, and resource management
    strategies specific to the restoration specialization. The method ensures that
    the AI player is properly configured before engaging in combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Restoration Druid Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      RestorationDruid druidBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized as a restoration druid AI'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Restoration Druid Bots
    code: "std::vector<RestorationDruid*> druids;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n\
      \    Player* bot = new Player();\n    druids.push_back(new RestorationDruid(bot));\n\
      }\n// All bots are now initialized as restoration druid AIs"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the creation of AI bots in TrinityCore's
    AI system. The method assumes that the Player object passed to it has already
    been properly initialized with valid character data. It's important to note that
    this constructor does not automatically add the bot to any group or instance -
    additional setup may be required for full functionality.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is a valid, non-null pointer before calling
    this constructor. Passing an uninitialized or invalid Player object will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, since this is a constructor,
    it should only be called once per object instance.
