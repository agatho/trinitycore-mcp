  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: HandlePlayerEnterZone
  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player * player, int areaflag)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a player enters an outdoor PvP zone, triggering relevant
    events and updates.
  description: The HandlePlayerEnterZone method is responsible for managing the behavior
    and state changes that occur when a player character enters an outdoor PvP zone
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically checks if the player's
    current area is part of an active Outdoor PvP system, and if so, it initializes
    or updates the player's PvP status, triggers relevant event handlers, and may
    modify the player's visibility or gameplay mechanics accordingly. It plays a crucial
    role in maintaining the integrity of outdoor PvP zones by ensuring that players
    are properly integrated into the zone's PvP dynamics upon entry.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the character entering
      the zone. Must not be null.
  - name: areaflag
    description: An integer identifier representing the area flag of the zone the
      player is entering. Used to determine which outdoor PvP system, if any, should
      be activated for this player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Zone Entry Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player, uint32 areaflag)\n{\n    OutdoorPvPMgr::Instance()->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player,\
      \ areaflag);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Outdoor PvP System
    code: "class MyOutdoorPvP : public OutdoorPvP\n{\npublic:\n    void HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player*\
      \ player, uint32 areaflag) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic before calling\
      \ base implementation\n        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Welcome to the\
      \ PvP zone!\");\n        OutdoorPvPMgr::Instance()->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player,\
      \ areaflag);\n        // Custom logic after\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core when a player's
    position changes into an outdoor PvP zone. Developers should ensure that any custom
    OutdoorPvP implementations properly call the base class implementation to maintain
    expected behavior. The method does not return a value but may modify internal
    state or trigger events.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid player pointers or area
    flags, as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all OutdoorPvP
    systems are properly initialized before this method is invoked.
