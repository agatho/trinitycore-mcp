  method: GetPacketsQueued
  signature: uint32 IBotSession::GetPacketsQueued() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of packets currently queued for transmission in the bot
    session.
  description: The GetPacketsQueued method retrieves the count of network packets
    that are currently waiting to be sent from the bot session's outgoing queue. This
    value represents the backlog of messages that have been prepared for transmission
    but not yet delivered to the client. The method is typically used for monitoring
    and debugging purposes to understand the current load or latency in packet delivery
    within a bot session. It provides insight into how many messages are pending transmission
    at any given moment, which can be useful for performance tuning or identifying
    potential bottlenecks in network communication.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of packets currently queued for
    transmission. Returns zero if no packets are queued.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor packet queue size
    code: "uint32 queuedPackets = botSession->GetPacketsQueued();\nif (queuedPackets\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: %u packets queued for transmission\"\
      , queuedPackets);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug network performance
    code: "void DebugBotSession(IBotSession* session)\n{\n    uint32 queued = session->GetPacketsQueued();\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot session packet queue size: %u\", queued);\n    //\
      \ Additional logic to handle high queue sizes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current queue state and may not reflect
    real-time changes due to concurrent access. The returned value is thread-safe
    for reading but should be used cautiously in performance-critical sections where
    frequent polling might impact efficiency.
  warnings: Frequent high values returned by this method may indicate network congestion
    or processing delays in the bot's message handling pipeline. This could potentially
    lead to client-side timeouts or disconnections if the queue grows too large.
