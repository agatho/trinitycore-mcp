  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: PredictObjectiveCompletion
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::PredictObjectiveCompletion(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the completion state of a specific quest objective for a player
    bot.
  description: The PredictObjectiveCompletion method calculates and updates the predicted
    completion status of a specified quest objective for a given player bot. This
    functionality is typically used in AI-driven quest management systems to anticipate
    when a quest objective will be fulfilled, allowing for proactive decision-making
    in automated gameplay scenarios. The method likely modifies internal tracking
    data structures to reflect the predicted outcome based on current progress and
    available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest objective
      completion is being predicted. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective to predict
      completion for. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index identifying which specific objective within the
      quest should be predicted. Must be a valid index for the given quest's objectives.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      ObjectiveTracker::PredictObjectiveCompletion(myBot, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an automated quest tracking system and may
    update internal state variables or caches. It's designed for use with AI-controlled
    bots rather than player characters. The prediction logic might consider factors
    like item collection rates, mob kill counts, or resource availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId and objectiveIndex are valid to prevent
    undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies internal tracking data which
    could affect other systems relying on accurate quest state information.
