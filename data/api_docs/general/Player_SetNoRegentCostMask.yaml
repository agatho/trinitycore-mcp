  class: Player
  method: SetNoRegentCostMask
  signature: void Player::SetNoRegentCostMask(int mask)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the regent cost mask for the player to control regeneration behavior.
  description: This method allows a player to modify their regent cost mask, which
    determines how much mana they consume during regeneration. The mask controls whether
    certain spells or abilities can regenerate mana without consuming resources. This
    is particularly useful for developers who want to customize gameplay mechanics
    or create special effects that bypass normal mana consumption rules.
  parameters:
  - name: mask
    description: An integer representing the regent cost mask value. This determines
      which spells or abilities can regenerate mana without consuming resources. Valid
      values are typically powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) that represent different
      categories of regen types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetNoRegentCostMask(1); // Enable regen for spell 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetNoRegentCostMask(3); // Enable regen for spells 1 and 2

      // This allows multiple regen types to bypass normal mana consumption'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the player's ability to regenerate mana during combat
    or movement. It should be used carefully as it can significantly alter gameplay
    balance. The mask value is typically set based on specific game mechanics and
    may require understanding of spell effects and regen types.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or unexpected
    behavior. This method should only be called when necessary, as it affects how
    the player's mana regeneration works during combat. Be cautious about using large
    mask values that might interfere with normal game mechanics.
