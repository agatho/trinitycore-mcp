  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: IsDistributionBalanced
  signature: bool BotLevelDistribution::IsDistributionBalanced(int faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot level distribution is balanced for the specified
    faction.
  description: The IsDistributionBalanced method evaluates the current distribution
    of bot levels within a specific faction to determine if it meets predefined balance
    criteria. This functionality is typically used in game environments where bots
    are deployed to maintain a certain difficulty or player engagement level. The
    method checks various factors such as level spread, concentration of bots at specific
    levels, and overall distribution variance against a baseline or target distribution.
    It returns true if the distribution is considered balanced according to internal
    algorithms, and false otherwise. This check is crucial for maintaining game fairness
    and preventing scenarios where bots are too concentrated at one level or too unevenly
    distributed across the level spectrum.
  parameters:
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier for which to evaluate the bot level distribution.
      Valid values typically correspond to faction IDs used in TrinityCore's database,
      such as 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde, or other custom faction identifiers.
  returns: Returns true if the bot level distribution for the specified faction is
    considered balanced according to internal algorithms; otherwise returns false.
    A balanced distribution generally indicates that bots are appropriately spread
    across levels without excessive clustering at specific tiers.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Alliance bot distribution is balanced
    code: "BotLevelDistribution distribution;\nbool isBalanced = distribution.IsDistributionBalanced(0);\
      \ // 0 represents Alliance faction\nif (isBalanced)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal game operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Alliance bot distribution is\
      \ balanced.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Trigger rebalancing logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Alliance bot distribution requires adjustment.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic bot balancing based on faction status
    code: "void UpdateBotDistribution()\n{\n    BotLevelDistribution distribution;\n\
      \    for (int faction = 0; faction < MAX_FACTIONS; ++faction)\n    {\n     \
      \   if (!distribution.IsDistributionBalanced(faction))\n        {\n        \
      \    // Rebalance bots for this faction\n            RebalanceBotsForFaction(faction);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal statistics such as mean level, standard deviation,
    and level clustering metrics to determine balance. It may be called periodically
    during game updates or in response to player activity changes. The exact criteria
    for what constitutes a 'balanced' distribution are implementation-specific but
    generally aim to prevent extreme imbalances that could affect gameplay experience.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct indicator of overall game balance,
    as it only evaluates bot distribution and does not account for other factors like
    player skill levels or dynamic difficulty adjustment. Repeated calls without proper
    caching may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
