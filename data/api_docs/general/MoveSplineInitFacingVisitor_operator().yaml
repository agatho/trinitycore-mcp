documentation:
  brief: Initializes movement spline facing angle for unit movement.
  description: The MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor::operator() method is used to set the
    facing direction for a unit's movement spline. This method is typically invoked
    during pathfinding and movement initialization to ensure that the unit faces the
    correct orientation when beginning its movement. It processes the provided angle
    value to configure the spline's facing behavior, which affects how the unit moves
    and orients itself in the game world. The method operates as part of a visitor
    pattern implementation for initializing movement splines.

  examples:
  - title: Setting Facing Angle for Unit Movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor visitor;

      float facingAngle = M_PI / 4; // 45 degrees in radians

      visitor(facingAngle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system in TrinityCore and should
    not be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked during spline
    initialization within the core movement logic. The angle parameter is expected
    to be in radians.
