documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles group events within the TrinityCore framework
  description: The HandleEvent method is responsible for processing incoming group
    events such as player joins, leaves, invitations, or role changes. It evaluates
    the event type and performs appropriate actions like updating group membership,
    notifying members, or triggering related game mechanics. This method serves as
    the central dispatcher for all group-related events in the World of Warcraft server
    environment. The method returns true if the event was successfully processed,
    and false if it encountered an error or could not be handled.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing details about the event to be processed,
      including event type, source player, target player, and associated data.
  returns: True if the group event was successfully handled and processed; false if
    the event could not be processed due to invalid data, missing context, or internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Event Handling
    code: "GroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GROUP_EVENT_PLAYER_JOINED;\nevent.sourcePlayer\
      \ = playerGuid;\nevent.targetPlayer = targetGuid;\nbool result = groupEventHandler.HandleEvent(event);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Event processed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Group Invitation Events
    code: "GroupEvent inviteEvent;\ninviteEvent.type = GROUP_EVENT_INVITATION_SENT;\n\
      inviteEvent.sourcePlayer = inviterGuid;\ninviteEvent.targetPlayer = inviteeGuid;\n\
      inviteEvent.groupId = groupId;\nbool success = groupEventHandler.HandleEvent(inviteEvent);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Handle invitation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the GroupMgr class when a group event
    occurs. It's important to ensure that all event data is properly initialized before
    calling this method. The method may modify internal group state and should be
    used with caution in multi-threaded environments where group consistency is critical.
  warnings: Do not call this method with uninitialized or malformed GroupEvent objects,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate event parameters
    before passing them to HandleEvent.
