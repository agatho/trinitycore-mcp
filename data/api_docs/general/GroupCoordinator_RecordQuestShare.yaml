documentation:
  brief: Records a quest share event for the specified quest ID within the group coordinator.
  description: The RecordQuestShare method logs or tracks when a player shares a quest
    with their group members in the World of Warcraft environment. This functionality
    is typically used by the GroupCoordinator to maintain synchronization and tracking
    of shared quest progress among group members. The method does not perform any
    direct game mechanics changes but serves as a data recording mechanism for quest
    sharing events. It is generally called when a player initiates or completes a
    quest share action within a group context.

  - title: Basic Quest Share Recording
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->RecordQuestShare(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore framework to maintain
    quest sharing state. It may be called from various quest-related events and should
    not be invoked directly without proper group context. The actual implementation
    details of how this recording is stored or processed are not visible in the provided
    signature.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordinator instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Calling this method without a valid group context may lead
    to undefined behavior or data inconsistency.
