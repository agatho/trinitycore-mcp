  signature: void NeuralNetwork::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the neural network to its initial state, clearing all learned weights
    and biases.
  description: The Reset method initializes the neural network by reinitializing all
    internal parameters such as weights and biases to their default values. This operation
    effectively clears any previously trained data and prepares the network for a
    new training cycle or fresh evaluation. The method is typically used when starting
    a new learning process or when resetting the network's state during runtime. It
    ensures that the neural network begins with a clean slate, which is essential
    for consistent and predictable behavior in AI-driven systems within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'NeuralNetwork network;

      // ... perform some training or operations ...

      network.Reset(); // Reset the network to initial state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new training session to ensure
    that previous learning does not interfere with new data. The reset operation is
    typically lightweight but may impact ongoing computations if called during active
    processing.
