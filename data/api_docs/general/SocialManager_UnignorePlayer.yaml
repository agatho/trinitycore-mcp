documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the ignore list
  description: The UnignorePlayer method removes a specified player from the current
    player's ignore list within the social system. This action allows the previously
    ignored player to send messages, invitations, and other social communications
    again. The method takes a player GUID as input and returns true if the player
    was successfully removed from the ignore list, or false if the player was not
    found in the ignore list. This functionality is part of TrinityCore's social manager
    system that handles player relationships and communication restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      ignore list. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the ignore list,
    false if the player was not found in the ignore list or if an error occurred during
    the operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nbool result = socialMgr->UnignorePlayer(12345);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Player successfully removed from ignore list\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Player removed from ignore list.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nuint32 targetGuid = 54321;\n\
      if (socialMgr->UnignorePlayer(targetGuid))\n{\n    // Successfully removed\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Player %u has been\
      \ unignored.\", targetGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player not in ignore list\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Player %u was not found\
      \ in your ignore list.\", targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the social manager's internal data structures and
    should be called from within a valid player session context. The operation is
    typically asynchronous and may involve database updates depending on the TrinityCore
    configuration. Performance impact is minimal as it only involves removing an entry
    from an in-memory list.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as passing an invalid GUID could lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies.
    This method does not validate whether the target player exists in the game world,
    only that they are in the ignore list.
