  class: CalendarMgr

  signature: void CalendarMgr::FreeInviteId(uint64 id)
documentation:
  brief: Frees a calendar invite ID for reuse by the system.
  description: The FreeInviteId method releases a previously allocated calendar invite
    identifier, making it available for future use. This method is typically called
    when a calendar event invitation is no longer needed or has been cancelled. The
    calendar manager maintains an internal pool of invite IDs that can be reused to
    avoid exhausting the ID space. This function ensures proper resource management
    within the calendar subsystem by returning unused IDs back to the pool.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the calendar invite to be freed.
      This value must correspond to a previously allocated invite ID that is currently
      in use.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Freeing an Unused Calendar Invite
    code: 'uint64 inviteId = sCalendarMgr->GetNextInviteId();

      // ... process the invite ...

      sCalendarMgr->FreeInviteId(inviteId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cleaning Up After Event Cancellation
    code: "void CancelCalendarEvent(uint64 eventId)\n{\n    // Cancel event logic\
      \ here\n    for (auto& invite : eventInvites)\n    {\n        sCalendarMgr->FreeInviteId(invite.Id);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar subsystem's resource management system.
    It should only be called with IDs that were previously allocated by the CalendarMgr.
    The implementation likely maintains an internal data structure to track used and
    free invite IDs, possibly using a pool or bitmap approach for efficiency.
  warnings: Calling FreeInviteId with an invalid or already-freed ID may result in
    undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that each ID is only freed once and
    only after it has been properly allocated by the calendar manager.
