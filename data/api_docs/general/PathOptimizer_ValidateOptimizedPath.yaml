  class: PathOptimizer
  method: ValidateOptimizedPath
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::ValidateOptimizedPath(const MovementPath & original,
    const MovementPath & optimized, Map * map) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether an optimized movement path is logically consistent with
    the original path and map boundaries.
  description: The ValidateOptimizedPath method checks the integrity of a movement
    path that has been optimized for performance or efficiency. It ensures that the
    optimized path adheres to the same logical constraints as the original path, including
    spatial consistency, map boundary adherence, and navigational feasibility. This
    validation is crucial in TrinityCore's AI and movement systems to prevent invalid
    or unsafe paths from being used in gameplay. The method takes both the original
    and optimized paths along with a reference to the map on which they are valid,
    ensuring that all checks are performed within the correct spatial context.
  parameters:
  - name: original
    description: The unoptimized movement path that serves as the baseline for validation.
      This path contains the original sequence of waypoints and movement data.
  - name: optimized
    description: The optimized version of the movement path to be validated against
      the original. This should contain a potentially simplified or more efficient
      sequence of waypoints.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object on which both paths are valid. Used to
      verify spatial constraints and map boundaries during validation.
  returns: Returns true if the optimized path is logically consistent with the original
    path and map constraints, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that
    the optimization process introduced invalid or unsafe movement data.

    code: "MovementPath originalPath;\nMovementPath optimizedPath;\nMap* map = player->GetMap();\n\
      \n// Populate paths with data...\nbool isValid = pathOptimizer.ValidateOptimizedPath(originalPath,\
      \ optimizedPath, map);\nif (!isValid) {\n    // Handle invalid path case\n \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Invalid optimized path detected!\");\n}"

  - title: Integration with Movement System
    code: "class PlayerMovementHandler {\npublic:\n    bool ProcessPathOptimization(Player*\
      \ player, MovementPath& original, MovementPath& optimized) {\n        PathOptimizer\
      \ optimizer;\n        Map* map = player->GetMap();\n        \n        if (!optimizer.ValidateOptimizedPath(original,\
      \ optimized, map)) {\n            sLog->outError(\"Movement optimization failed\
      \ validation for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n            return\
      \ false;\n        }\n        \n        // Proceed with validated path\n    \
      \    player->UpdateMovementInfo(optimized);\n        return true;\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method performs spatial validation checks including distance consistency,
    map boundary adherence, and waypoint connectivity. It is typically used internally
    by TrinityCore's pathfinding system to ensure that optimizations do not compromise
    movement safety or game logic. The implementation may involve checking for collisions,
    verifying that waypoints are within navigable areas, and ensuring the path remains
    continuous.
  warnings: This method assumes that both input paths have been properly initialized
    and populated with valid data. Passing uninitialized or corrupted paths can lead
    to undefined behavior or false validation results. Additionally, this method does
    not validate the actual movement mechanics beyond logical consistency; it's meant
    to be used in conjunction with other movement validation systems.
