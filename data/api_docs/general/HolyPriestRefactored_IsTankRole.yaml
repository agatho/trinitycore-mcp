  signature: bool HolyPriestRefactored::IsTankRole(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Holy Priest is currently assigned to a tanking role
    within the group.
  description: The IsTankRole method evaluates the current assignment or status of
    the Holy Priest instance to determine if it is designated as a tank. This functionality
    is crucial for AI decision-making in group scenarios, particularly when determining
    which class should assume responsibility for threat generation and mob control.
    The method may consider factors such as role assignments, gear configuration,
    or current combat state to make this determination. It is typically used by the
    AI system to dynamically adjust behavior based on the priest's assigned role within
    the party context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Holy Priest is currently acting in a tanking capacity;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the AI should prioritize defensive
    actions, threat management, or support roles for this instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (priest.IsTankRole()) {\n    // Execute tank-specific behavior\n   \
      \ priest.CastShield();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Role Assignment
    code: "if (!priest.IsTankRole()) {\n    // Switch to healing role if not tanking\n\
      \    priest.SetRole(ROLE_HEALING);\n} else {\n    // Continue tanking behavior\n\
      \    priest.AttackTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework that dynamically assigns
    roles based on group composition and encounter requirements. It may interact with
    TrinityCore's role management system to determine if the player has been designated
    as a tank via raid/instance roles or gear configuration.
  warnings: The method assumes that role assignment has already been properly initialized
    within the AI context. If called before role setup, it might return incorrect
    values or cause unexpected behavior in combat decisions.
