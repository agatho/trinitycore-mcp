  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: GetItemQualityMultiplier
  signature: float PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetItemQualityMultiplier(uint8 quality)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the multiplier value applied to item quality for trade calculations
    in player bot behavior.
  description: The GetItemQualityMultiplier method retrieves a floating-point multiplier
    that is used in player bot trade logic to adjust the value of items based on their
    quality level. This multiplier influences how bots evaluate and trade items within
    the game's economy system. The method takes a uint8 parameter representing the
    item quality and returns a corresponding float multiplier. This functionality
    is crucial for determining the relative worth of items in automated trading decisions
    made by player bots, particularly in the context of TrinityCore's playerbot AI
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: quality
    description: The quality level of the item (0-6), where 0 represents poor quality
      and 6 represents legendary quality. Valid values range from 0 to 6 inclusive.
  returns: A float value representing the multiplier applied to item quality for trade
    calculations. Higher quality items typically return higher multipliers, with values
    generally increasing as quality improves from poor (0) to legendary (6).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;

      float multiplier = tradeConfig.GetItemQualityMultiplier(4);

      // Returns the multiplier for rare quality items (4)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Trade Value Calculation
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;

      uint8 itemQuality = 5; // Epic quality

      float baseValue = 100.0f;

      float adjustedValue = baseValue * tradeConfig.GetItemQualityMultiplier(itemQuality);

      // Adjusts the base value based on epic item quality multiplier'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot AI configuration system and is likely
    used internally by TrinityCore's bot trading logic. The exact multiplier values
    depend on the specific implementation within the PlayerbotTradeConfig class, which
    may be configurable through in-game settings or configuration files.
  warnings: Ensure that the quality parameter passed to this method is within valid
    range (0-6) to avoid unexpected behavior or potential access violations. Invalid
    quality values might cause undefined behavior or incorrect trade calculations.
