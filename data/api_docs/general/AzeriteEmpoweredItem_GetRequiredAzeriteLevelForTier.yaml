  method: GetRequiredAzeriteLevelForTier
  signature: int AzeriteEmpoweredItem::GetRequiredAzeriteLevelForTier(int tier) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required Azerite level needed to unlock a specific tier of
    an Azerite empowered item.
  description: This method calculates and returns the minimum Azerite level required
    to activate or progress to a given tier within the Azerite empowerment system.
    In World of Warcraft's Azerite armor system, players can enhance their gear by
    spending Azerite power, which is organized into tiers. Each tier requires a specific
    amount of Azerite power to unlock. This function provides the necessary Azerite
    level threshold for a specified tier, allowing developers and systems to validate
    player progression or display tier requirements. The method operates on the internal
    data structure of the AzeriteEmpoweredItem class and assumes valid tier inputs.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum Azerite level required to reach the
    specified tier. Returns a positive integer value indicating the tier's unlock
    requirement; typically increases with each higher tier.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Required Level for Tier 3
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem item;

      int requiredLevel = item.GetRequiredAzeriteLevelForTier(3);

      // Returns the Azerite level needed to unlock tier 3 of this item.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite empowerment logic and relies on hardcoded
    or configuration-based data for tier thresholds. It should be used in contexts
    where Azerite progression validation or UI display is needed, such as during item
    tooltip generation or player progress checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the input tier value is valid (typically within expected range
    like 1-10), as invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    The method does not perform bounds checking internally.
