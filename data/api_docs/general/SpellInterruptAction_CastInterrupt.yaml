  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: CastInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::CastInterrupt(BotAI * ai, ::Unit *
    target, uint32 interruptSpell)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current spell cast by the AI bot on the specified target using
    the provided interrupt spell.
  description: The CastInterrupt method is used to forcefully interrupt an ongoing
    spell cast by a BotAI instance on a target unit. This action typically occurs
    when the bot needs to stop its current casting behavior, such as when switching
    targets, encountering a threat, or executing a priority action. The method utilizes
    the specified interruptSpell ID to determine how the interruption should be handled
    within the game's spell system. It returns an ActionResult indicating success
    or failure of the interruption attempt. This method is essential for managing
    bot behavior in dynamic combat situations where immediate response to changing
    conditions is required.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns the spell being interrupted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit (player or creature) on which the spell is currently
      casting. Must not be null.
  - name: interruptSpell
    description: The spell ID of the interrupt spell to use for stopping the current
      cast. Should correspond to a valid interrupt spell in the game's database.
  returns: ActionResult indicating whether the spell interruption was successful or
    not. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nuint32 interruptSpellId = 1766;\
      \ // Example: Kick\nActionResult result = SpellInterruptAction::CastInterrupt(bot,\
      \ target, interruptSpellId);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    //\
      \ Spell interrupted successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interrupt Based on Target State
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nuint32 interruptSpellId = 1766;\
      \ // Kick\nif (target->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n{\n    ActionResult\
      \ result = SpellInterruptAction::CastInterrupt(bot, target, interruptSpellId);\n\
      \    if (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n    {\n        // Handle successful\
      \ interruption\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI and target are valid and in a state where
    spell interruption is possible. The interruptSpell must be a valid spell ID that
    can interrupt casts, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or ineffective.
  warnings: Ensure that the ai and target parameters are not null before calling this
    method. Using an invalid interruptSpell ID may result in no interruption occurring
    or unexpected behavior.
