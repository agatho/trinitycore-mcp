  class: QuestPickup
  method: IsQuestAvailable
  signature: bool QuestPickup::IsQuestAvailable(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified quest is available for pickup by a player
    bot.
  description: The IsQuestAvailable method checks if a given quest ID can be picked
    up by a specific player bot. It evaluates various conditions such as quest prerequisites,
    player level requirements, faction restrictions, and quest state to determine
    availability. This method is commonly used in AI systems or questing scripts to
    decide which quests should be offered or accepted by the bot. The check considers
    whether the quest has been completed, if the player meets the minimum level requirement,
    and if any required previous quests have been completed.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check for availability. Must
      be a valid quest ID present in the game's quest database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is checking
      quest availability. The method evaluates the bot's current state, level, faction,
      and completed quests against the requirements of the specified quest.
  returns: Returns true if the quest is available for pickup by the bot, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the quest is already completed, the player does
    not meet prerequisites, or the quest is not yet available due to level or faction
    restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Availability Check
    code: "if (questPickup->IsQuestAvailable(12345, bot)) {\n    // Proceed with quest\
      \ pickup logic\n    bot->AddQuest(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Questing Logic
    code: "uint32 availableQuest = 0;\nfor (uint32 i = 1000; i < 2000; ++i) {\n  \
      \  if (questPickup->IsQuestAvailable(i, bot)) {\n        availableQuest = i;\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}\nif (availableQuest > 0) {\n    // Process the first\
      \ available quest\n    bot->CompleteQuest(availableQuest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and state checks, so it should not
    be called excessively in performance-critical sections. The implementation may
    cache certain results for efficiency depending on the internal design of QuestPickup
    class. The method considers both active and inactive quest states, including those
    that are flagged as repeatable or daily quests.
  warnings: Do not assume that a quest being available means it can be immediately
    accepted; additional checks such as inventory space or quest-specific conditions
    may still prevent pickup. Always validate the return value before proceeding with
    quest-related actions to avoid unexpected behavior.
