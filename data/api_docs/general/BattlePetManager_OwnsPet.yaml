  method: OwnsPet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::OwnsPet(int * player, uint32 speciesId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player owns a specific battle pet species.
  description: The OwnsPet method checks if a given player has obtained and currently
    owns a specific battle pet species. This method is used in the context of World
    of Warcraft's Battle Pet system, where players collect various pet species through
    gameplay. The method takes a pointer to a player object and a species ID, then
    returns true if the player has that pet in their collection, or false otherwise.
    It does not verify if the pet is currently active or summoned, only that it exists
    in the player's owned pets list. This functionality is essential for battle pet
    mechanics such as determining which pets can be used in battles or traded.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose pet ownership
      is being checked. Must not be null.
  - name: speciesId
    description: The unique identifier for a battle pet species. This corresponds
      to the BattlePetSpeciesID used in the game's database and API.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player owns the given battle pet species,
    false otherwise. The method will return false if either parameter is invalid or
    if the player does not have the specified pet in their collection.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Owns a Specific Pet
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is initialized\nuint32 petSpeciesId\
      \ = 1234; // Example species ID\nif (BattlePetManager::OwnsPet(player, petSpeciesId))\
      \ {\n    // Player owns this pet\n    printf(\"Player has the pet with species\
      \ ID %u\\n\", petSpeciesId);\n} else {\n    // Player does not own this pet\n\
      \    printf(\"Player does not have the pet with species ID %u\\n\", petSpeciesId);\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetManager class which handles all battle
    pet related functionality in TrinityCore. The implementation likely involves checking
    the player's pet collection database entries or cached data structures. Performance-wise,
    this should be a fast lookup operation as it typically uses hash maps or similar
    efficient data structures for pet ownership tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, make
    sure the speciesId corresponds to an actual existing battle pet species in the
    game database, otherwise the result may be misleading if the ID is invalid.
