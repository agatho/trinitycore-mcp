  method: KilledMonster
  signature: void Player::KilledMonster(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Records that a player has killed a creature, updating quest progress and
    triggering related events.
  description: The KilledMonster method is used to notify the game system that a player
    has successfully killed a specific creature. This method typically triggers quest
    update mechanisms and may activate related event handlers in the game world. It's
    commonly used in quest completion scenarios where a player needs to kill a specific
    monster to progress a quest or meet objective requirements. The method ensures
    proper tracking of player actions and maintains consistency with game mechanics
    that require player interaction with NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to the Creature object that was killed by the player. This
      parameter must be valid and cannot be nullptr. The creature object should represent
      a real NPC in the game world that has been defeated by the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::KilledMonster(const Creature * creature)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ example\n    if (creature && creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n    {\n     \
      \   // Update quest progress\n        QuestObjectiveUpdate(12345);\n    }\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by game systems when a player
    kills an NPC. Developers should ensure that the creature parameter is valid before
    calling this method. The method may trigger related quest events and is part of
    the broader quest system implementation.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly unless explicitly required by
    custom code. It's generally used internally by the game engine to track player
    progress in quests. Calling it incorrectly can cause quest progression issues
    or unexpected behavior.
