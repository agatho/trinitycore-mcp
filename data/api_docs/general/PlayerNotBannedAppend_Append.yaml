  brief: Appends player not banned data to a channel notification packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with information indicating that a player is not banned from a channel.
    This method is typically used in the context of channel management within TrinityCore's
    networking system, where it helps construct appropriate responses to client requests
    regarding channel membership and permissions. The method operates on a const object
    and modifies the provided packet in-place without returning any value. It is part
    of the PlayerNotBannedAppend class which handles specific aspects of player channel
    access control.

    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called in a network response context where
    channel membership status needs to be communicated to clients. The packet modification
    happens in-place, so ensure the packet object is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
