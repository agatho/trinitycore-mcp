  brief: Destroys a CooldownEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CooldownEventBus class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    This method ensures that all internal data structures, event listeners, and references
    are safely destroyed when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's cooldown system, this may involve unregistering
    from global cooldown events or releasing any cached cooldown information. The
    destructor is automatically invoked during object destruction and should not be
    called manually.

    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    CooldownEventBus bus;\n    // ... use bus\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when bus goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to note that this method should not be called
    directly unless explicitly managing object lifetime through raw pointers.
