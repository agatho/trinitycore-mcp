  signature: void Player::SendTameFailure(int result)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a tame failure message to the player when attempting to tame a creature.
  description: The SendTameFailure method is used to notify a player when their attempt
    to tame a creature fails. This method is typically called when a player tries
    to tame a creature that is either not tamed, or when the taming process fails
    due to various reasons such as insufficient mana, invalid target, or the creature
    being already tamed. The method sends an appropriate failure message to the client
    based on the result parameter which indicates the specific reason for the failure.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: 'The failure result code indicating why the taming failed. Valid
      values include: 0 (no error), 1 (invalid target), 2 (not enough mana), 3 (creature
      already tamed), 4 (creature not tamed), 5 (no pet available), 6 (other error).'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendTameFailure(1); // Sends failure message for invalid target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "void tamingProcess(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (!creature->IsTameable())\n\
      \    {\n        player->SendTameFailure(3);\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Additional logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's internal communication system and should
    be used in conjunction with other taming-related methods. It's important to note
    that this method does not actually perform the taming operation, but rather communicates
    failure to the client.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may cause client-side
    errors if called incorrectly. The result parameter must match valid failure codes
    to ensure proper client behavior.
