  method: GetMaxPlayersPerTeam
  signature: uint16 BattlegroundTemplate::GetMaxPlayersPerTeam() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of players allowed per team in the battleground.
  description: The GetMaxPlayersPerTeam method retrieves the upper limit of players
    that can be assigned to a single team within the battleground template. This value
    is typically defined during battleground creation and determines how many players
    can participate on each side of the match. The method provides essential information
    for balancing teams, managing player queues, and enforcing game rules related
    to battleground participation limits. It does not perform any validation or modification
    operations; it simply returns a pre-configured value associated with the battleground
    type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the maximum number of players allowed per team
    in this battleground template. This value is typically between 1 and 40, depending
    on the specific battleground type (e.g., 10 for Eye of the Storm, 15 for Warsong
    Gulch).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Team Size
    code: 'BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BGTypeId::BATTLEGROUND_WS);

      uint16 maxPlayersPerTeam = bgTemplate->GetMaxPlayersPerTeam();

      printf("Maximum players per team: %u\n", maxPlayersPerTeam);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Player Queue Logic
    code: "void CheckBattlegroundCapacity(BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate) {\n  \
      \  uint16 maxPlayers = bgTemplate->GetMaxPlayersPerTeam();\n    if (maxPlayers\
      \ > 0) {\n        // Proceed with queue logic\n        printf(\"Battleground\
      \ supports up to %u players per team\\n\", maxPlayers);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter that directly accesses a cached value from
    the battleground template. It's designed for fast retrieval and should not be
    used in performance-critical loops without caching the result. The returned value
    corresponds to the maximum players per team as defined in the battleground configuration
    files or database entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlegroundTemplate pointer is valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. This method
    assumes the template has been properly initialized with valid data; invalid templates
    may return unexpected values.
