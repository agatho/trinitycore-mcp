  class: PriestAI
  method: GetManaPercent
  signature: float PriestAI::GetManaPercent()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current mana percentage of the priest AI unit.
  description: The GetManaPercent method computes the ratio of current mana to maximum
    mana for the priest AI unit, expressed as a floating-point value between 0.0 and
    100.0. This percentage is useful for decision-making in AI behavior, such as determining
    when to cast mana-efficient spells or when to switch to defensive abilities. The
    method performs no direct interaction with the game state beyond reading the current
    mana and maximum mana values of the associated unit. It assumes that the priest
    AI unit has valid mana statistics and does not perform any error checking for
    invalid states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current mana percentage of the priest AI
    unit, ranging from 0.0 (no mana) to 100.0 (full mana).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Decision Logic
    code: "if (priestAI->GetManaPercent() > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Cast a mana-intensive\
      \ spell\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_MIND_FLAY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Mana Percentage for Resource Management
    code: "float manaPercent = priestAI->GetManaPercent();\nif (manaPercent < 20.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Switch to a defensive ability or restore mana\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_PENANCE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying unit's current and maximum mana values
    being properly initialized. If the unit has no mana (e.g., non-mana class), it
    will return 0.0. The returned value is a floating-point representation of the
    percentage, which may introduce minor precision differences in comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that the PriestAI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Do not assume that the returned value
    will always be within the [0.0, 100.0] range if the unit's mana state is corrupted
    or invalid.
