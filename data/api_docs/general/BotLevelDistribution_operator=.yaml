documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotLevelDistribution object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotLevelDistribution class copies all
    member data from the source object to the current object. This method performs
    a deep copy of the distribution data, ensuring that both objects maintain independent
    copies of their internal structures. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this operation allows for transferring level distribution configurations between
    different bot instances or resetting a bot's level distribution settings. The
    operator follows standard C++ assignment semantics and returns a reference to
    the assigned object to enable chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotLevelDistribution object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotLevelDistribution object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling operator chaining
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution bot1;

      BotLevelDistribution bot2 = bot1; // Uses copy constructor

      bot2 = bot1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignments
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution distribution1, distribution2, distribution3;

      // ... initialize distributions ...

      distribution3 = distribution2 = distribution1; // Chained assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to ensure that modifications
    to one object do not affect another. The implementation should handle any dynamically
    allocated memory properly to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers.
