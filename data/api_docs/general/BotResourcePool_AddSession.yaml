documentation:
  brief: Adds a new bot session to the resource pool for management and processing.
  description: The AddSession method integrates a new BotSession into the BotResourcePool,
    enabling the pool to track and manage the session's resources and lifecycle. This
    method is typically invoked when a new bot is initialized or connected to the
    system. The session is stored internally within the pool, allowing for centralized
    resource allocation, monitoring, and cleanup operations. It ensures that all bot-related
    activities are properly registered with the resource management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(botId);

      resourcePool->AddSession(session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided session pointer is valid and not null.
    The internal storage mechanism may use thread-safe containers depending on implementation
    details. Consider performance implications when adding sessions in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Passing a null shared_ptr to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or runtime errors. Ensure proper initialization of BotSession objects
    before calling AddSession.
