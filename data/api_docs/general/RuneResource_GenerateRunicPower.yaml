  signature: void RuneResource::GenerateRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates runic power for a player character, increasing their rune resource
    pool.
  description: The GenerateRunicPower method is used to add a specified amount of
    runic power to a player's rune resource. This method typically occurs during gameplay
    when the player performs actions that generate runic power, such as attacking
    with death knight abilities or using certain spells. The generated power is added
    to the existing runic power pool, up to the maximum allowed by the player's rune
    configuration. This method does not directly affect the player's rune cooldowns
    but contributes to their overall resource management for death knight abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to generate. Valid values are positive
      integers representing the power units to be added to the player's rune resource
      pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to generate runic power
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();

      runeResource->GenerateRunicPower(10);

      // Adds 10 runic power units to the player''s resource pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating runic power based on ability usage
    code: "void OnDeathKnightAbilityUse(Player* player, uint32 powerAmount)\n{\n \
      \   RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();\n    if (runeResource)\n\
      \    {\n        runeResource->GenerateRunicPower(powerAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when death
    knight abilities are used or when certain events occur. The actual implementation
    may vary based on the player's class specialization and equipped items that modify
    runic power generation rates.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is a positive integer, as negative values
    may cause unexpected behavior in resource management. This method should not be
    called directly from outside the core game logic without proper validation.
