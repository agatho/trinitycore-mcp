  class: Unit
  method: ModifyHealth
  signature: int64 Unit::ModifyHealth(int64 val)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the health value of the unit by the specified amount.
  description: The ModifyHealth method adjusts the current health of a Unit object
    by adding or subtracting the provided value. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manipulate unit health during combat, healing,
    or damage scenarios. It handles both positive and negative values, allowing for
    flexible health modifications. The method returns the updated health value after
    modification, ensuring that the unit's health remains within valid bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The amount by which to modify the unit's health. Positive values
      increase health, while negative values decrease it.
  returns: The method returns the new health value after modification has been applied,
    ensuring that the unit's health remains within valid bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Modification Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;

      int64 newHealth = target->ModifyHealth(100);

      // This adds 100 to the unit''s current health'
    language: cpp
  - title: Damage Health Modification Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;

      int64 newHealth = target->ModifyHealth(-50);

      // This subtracts 50 from the unit''s current health, representing damage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other health-related methods
    to ensure proper handling of unit health during combat. It may be subject to game
    mechanics such as health caps and maximum values depending on the context.
  warnings: Be cautious when using negative values, as they can cause the unit's health
    to go below zero, potentially leading to invalid states or death in certain scenarios.
