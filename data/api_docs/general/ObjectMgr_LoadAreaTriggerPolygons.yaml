  class: ObjectMgr
  method: LoadAreaTriggerPolygons
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadAreaTriggerPolygons()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes area trigger polygon data from the database into memory
    for collision detection and gameplay triggers.
  description: The LoadAreaTriggerPolygons method initializes and loads all area trigger
    polygon definitions from the database into the ObjectMgr's internal data structures.
    These polygons define specific regions in the game world where certain events
    or interactions occur, such as quest triggers, teleportation areas, or combat
    zones. The method typically executes during server startup or map loading phases
    to ensure that all area trigger geometries are available for real-time collision
    detection and event activation. It processes polygon data including vertex coordinates,
    associated trigger IDs, and boundary definitions to create an optimized spatial
    index for fast lookup operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadAreaTriggerPolygons();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other loading processes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and should only be
    invoked once per instance. The loaded polygons are used for real-time collision
    detection, which can impact performance if there are many complex polygons. The
    method assumes that the database connection is already established and that the
    relevant area_trigger_polygon table contains valid data.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times during runtime as it may cause
    memory leaks or duplicate polygon entries. Ensure that all polygon data in the
    database is properly formatted and does not contain invalid vertex coordinates
    to prevent crashes or incorrect behavior.
