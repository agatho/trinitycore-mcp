  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: HandleGroupMovement
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::HandleGroupMovement(BotAI * ai, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Processes group movement behavior for a bot AI leader following a group.
  description: The HandleGroupMovement method manages the movement logic for a bot
    AI when it is acting as a leader in a group. It evaluates the current state of
    the group and the leader's position, then determines appropriate movement actions
    such as moving towards group members, maintaining formation, or adjusting speed
    based on group dynamics. This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles
    to ensure the bot leader maintains proper positioning within the group context.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the behavior of the bot.
      This parameter provides access to AI state, movement capabilities, and group
      information.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the current group the bot
      is leading. Used to determine group member positions, leader status, and overall
      group dynamics for movement decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsLeader())\n    {\n    \
      \    Group* group = GetGroup();\n        if (group)\n        {\n           \
      \ HandleGroupMovement(this, group);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom leader behavior
    code: "class CustomLeaderAI : public BotAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (IsLeader() && GetGroup())\n        {\n\
      \            HandleGroupMovement(this, GetGroup());\n            // Additional\
      \ custom logic here\n        }\n        BotAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has been properly initialized as a group
    leader and that the group contains valid members. The movement decisions are based
    on current positions, group size, and AI configuration settings. Performance is
    optimized by avoiding unnecessary calculations when no movement is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance and Group pointer are valid before calling
    this method to prevent crashes. Do not call this method outside of a proper AI
    update context where movement decisions can be safely processed.
