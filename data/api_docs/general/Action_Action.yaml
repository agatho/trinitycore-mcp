  signature: void Action::Action(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an action with the specified name for use in the game's AI system.
  description: The Action constructor initializes a new action instance with the provided
    name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to set up
    actions that can be executed by AI-controlled entities such as NPCs or creatures.
    The action name serves as a unique identifier for the action and is used internally
    by the AI system to manage and execute appropriate behaviors. This constructor
    does not perform any complex operations but rather sets up the basic structure
    needed for an action to be recognized and processed by the game engine's AI subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier that uniquely names this action. This name is
      used internally by the AI system to reference and execute the action. Must be
      a valid, non-empty string.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Initialization
    code: 'Action moveAction("MoveToTarget");

      // Initializes an action named "MoveToTarget" for use in AI behavior.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Actions
    code: 'Action attackAction("AttackTarget");

      Action defendAction("DefendPosition");

      Action idleAction("Idle");

      // Creates three distinct actions for different AI behaviors.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI infrastructure in TrinityCore and should
    be called during object initialization or when setting up AI behavior trees. The
    action name must be unique within the scope where it's used to avoid conflicts
    in the AI system.
