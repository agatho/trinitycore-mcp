  brief: Evaluates whether a target unit meets the criteria for spell targeting.
  description: The SpellTargetSelector::operator() method is a predicate function
    that determines if a given Unit target is valid for spell casting. It evaluates
    various conditions such as target visibility, faction relationships, health status,
    and other spell-specific constraints. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with STL algorithms like std::find_if or container methods to filter valid targets
    from a list of potential candidates. The evaluation logic considers factors like
    whether the target is alive, within range, not immune to the spell effects, and
    meets any additional criteria defined by the spell's targeting rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit satisfies all the conditions required for
    the spell to be cast on it; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that the target is valid for targeting, while false means the target should be
    excluded from consideration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Target Selection
    code: "SpellTargetSelector selector;\nUnit* target = ...; // some unit\nif (selector(target))\
      \ {\n    // Target is valid for spell casting\n    // Proceed with spell execution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with STL Algorithm
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> targets;\n// ... populate targets ...\nSpellTargetSelector\
      \ selector;\nauto it = std::find_if(targets.begin(), targets.end(), selector);\n\
      if (it != targets.end()) {\n    // Found a valid target\n    Unit* validTarget\
      \ = *it;\n    // Cast spell on validTarget\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in the core spell system of TrinityCore for
    determining valid targets. It's important to note that this operator does not
    perform actual spell casting, but only evaluates target eligibility. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific spell and its targeting requirements. Performance-wise,
    this function should be kept lightweight as it might be called frequently during
    spell targeting calculations.
  warnings: Do not assume all targets are valid for every spell - different spells
    have different targeting rules. This method may return false for targets that
    are otherwise valid in other contexts (e.g., a target might be immune to a specific
    spell effect even if it's otherwise a valid target). Always validate the target
    selection before proceeding with spell execution.
