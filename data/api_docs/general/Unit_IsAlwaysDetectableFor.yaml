  method: IsAlwaysDetectableFor
  signature: bool Unit::IsAlwaysDetectableFor(const int * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is always detectable for a specific observer.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is always
    detectable for a given observer, meaning it will not be hidden or invisible to
    that observer regardless of its current state. The method evaluates the detection
    status based on the observer's ability to see the unit, which can be influenced
    by various game mechanics including stealth, invisibility, and detection abilities.
    It is commonly used in scenarios where visibility needs to be enforced for specific
    players or NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to the observer (player or creature) that is checking detection
      status. This parameter represents the entity whose detection capabilities are
      being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is always detectable for the specified observer,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the unit cannot be hidden
    from the observer, while a return value of false means the unit may be hidden
    or invisible to the observer depending on its current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsAlwaysDetectableFor(&player)) {\n    // Unit is always detectable\
      \ for player\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking the observer's detection abilities
    and potential state effects such as stealth or invisibility. Performance considerations
    are minimal since this method typically involves simple checks rather than complex
    computations.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is visible in general,
    as it only checks for always detectable status. It may return false even when
    the unit is visible to the observer due to temporary invisibility or stealth effects.
