  signature: const int & Ticket::GetComment() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the comment associated with the ticket
  description: The GetComment method retrieves the textual comment or description
    that was submitted with a player support ticket. This method provides access to
    the user's reported issue or question details. The returned reference allows direct
    access to the internal comment storage, so modifications to the returned value
    will affect the ticket's comment field. This is typically used in conjunction
    with other ticket management functions to display or process player-submitted
    feedback.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the comment ID or identifier
    associated with this ticket. The exact meaning of this integer depends on how
    the ticketing system stores comments internally, potentially serving as a foreign
    key to a comments table or as a direct comment identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Ticket Comment
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif (ticket)\n\
      {\n    const int& commentId = ticket->GetComment();\n    std::cout << \"Ticket\
      \ comment ID: \" << commentId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified directly. The integer returned likely represents an internal identifier
    or index rather than the actual comment text itself. This is a getter method with
    no side effects and should be thread-safe if the underlying ticket object is properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in multi-threaded environments where
    the ticket might be modified concurrently. Since it returns a const reference,
    modifications to the returned value are not allowed, but the underlying data could
    change if accessed through other methods or threads.
