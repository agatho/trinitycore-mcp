documentation:
  brief: Sets the animation tier for the unit, controlling how animations are displayed
    to clients.
  description: The SetAnimTier method allows developers to specify the animation tier
    that a unit should use for displaying animations to players. This is particularly
    useful for controlling how animations are shown in different contexts such as
    combat, movement, or idle states. The method accepts an AnimTier enum value and
    can optionally notify the client about the change. Animation tiers determine the
    level of detail and complexity of animations displayed by the unit, with higher
    tiers showing more complex animations and lower tiers showing simpler ones.
  parameters:
  - name: animTier
    description: The animation tier to set for this unit. Valid values are typically
      from 0-4, where 0 represents no animation (default), 1 represents basic animations,
      2 represents medium complexity animations, 3 represents high complexity animations,
      and 4 represents full detail animations.
  - name: notifyClient
    description: When true, the client will be notified of the animation tier change.
      When false, the change is applied internally without notifying the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetAnimTier(AnimTier::ANIM_TIER_3, true);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetAnimTier(AnimTier::ANIM_TIER_2, false);

      // This will set the animation tier to medium complexity without notifying client

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for controlling animation display in World
    of Warcraft's game mechanics. The animation tier affects how animations are rendered
    and can impact performance, especially when multiple units are involved. It should
    be used carefully to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause visual inconsistencies or animation
    glitches in the client. Care should be taken when setting animation tiers for
    different units as it may affect how animations are displayed in combat and movement
    scenarios.
