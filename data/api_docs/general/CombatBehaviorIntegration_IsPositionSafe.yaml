  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given position is safe for combat behavior execution.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method determines if a specified position is considered
    safe for the AI to execute combat behaviors. This typically involves checking
    for environmental hazards, line of sight, proximity to enemies, or other game-specific
    conditions that would make the position unsuitable for engaging in combat. The
    method returns true if the position is deemed safe and false otherwise. It's commonly
    used by AI systems to make decisions about where to move, attack, or perform actions
    during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This value typically corresponds to a location index, coordinate pair,
      or node within the AI's navigation system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is safe for combat behavior execution;
    otherwise returns false. A safe position generally means it does not contain immediate
    threats or obstacles that would prevent effective combat engagement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is safe
    code: "if (combatBehaviorIntegration.IsPositionSafe(12345)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with combat behavior at this position\n    player->Attack();\n} else {\n \
      \   // Find an alternative position\n    player->MoveToNextSafePosition();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPositionSafe in a loop to find safe positions
    code: "int safePosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions; ++i) {\n  \
      \  if (combatBehaviorIntegration.IsPositionSafe(i)) {\n        safePosition\
      \ = i;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (safePosition != -1) {\n    player->SetCurrentPosition(safePosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive calculations such as pathfinding checks
    or threat assessments, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    sections of code. The exact safety criteria for a position are implementation-specific
    and may vary based on the current combat situation.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing invalid position identifiers
    may lead to undefined behavior. This method should not be used as a sole determinant
    for all AI decisions without considering other factors like enemy proximity or
    health status.
