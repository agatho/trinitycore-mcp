    & updatedData)
documentation:
  brief: Updates an existing guild event with new data.
  description: The UpdateGuildEvent method modifies an existing guild event identified
    by its unique event ID. It takes a GuildEvent object containing updated information
    and applies those changes to the corresponding event in the guild's event system.
    This method is typically used when guild leaders or officers need to modify event
    details such as title, description, time, or other properties after the event
    has been created. The method ensures data consistency within the guild event coordinator
    and may trigger notifications or updates to affected guild members.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to be updated. This ID must
      correspond to an existing event in the guild's event system.
  - name: updatedData
    description: A GuildEvent object containing the new data that will replace the
      current event information. All fields in this object are considered for updating,
      including title, description, time, and other relevant properties.
  returns: Returns true if the guild event was successfully updated; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the update operation completed without errors or
    if the specified event ID did not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Update a Guild Event
    code: "GuildEvent newEventData;\nnewEventData.title = \"New Guild Raid Title\"\
      ;\nnewEventData.description = \"Updated raid description for next week\";\n\
      newEventData.time = time(nullptr) + 3600; // One hour from now\nbool success\
      \ = guildEventCoordinator->UpdateGuildEvent(12345, newEventData);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Guild event updated successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to update guild event\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the eventId passed in is valid and corresponds to
    an existing event. It's recommended to verify the existence of the event before
    calling this function to avoid unnecessary failures. The implementation may involve
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when updating events concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId will result in a failed update
    operation. Ensure that all event IDs are valid and managed properly by the guild
    event coordinator system. Also, be cautious about concurrent access to the same
    event from multiple threads which could lead to race conditions.
