  signature: void GroupCoordination::BalanceThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Balances threat levels among group members to ensure fair distribution of
    aggro.
  description: The BalanceThreat method in the GroupCoordination class redistributes
    threat values across all members of a group to prevent any single player from
    accumulating excessive aggro. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining balanced
    gameplay during encounters where multiple players are targeting the same mob.
    The method typically ensures that threat is evenly distributed or follows a predefined
    balancing algorithm based on player roles, distance, or other factors. It may
    be invoked automatically by the game engine or manually by scripts during specific
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Scenario
    code: "void HandleCombatSituation()\n{\n    GroupCoordination* gc = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      \    if (gc)\n        gc->BalanceThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    group combat events. It may involve recalculating threat tables and updating mob
    target selection logic. Performance impact is generally low unless dealing with
    large groups or high-frequency calls.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat contexts might lead
    to unexpected behavior in threat management systems. Ensure that group members
    are actively engaged in combat before invoking this function.
