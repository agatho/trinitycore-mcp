  class: CreatureAI

  signature: void CreatureAI::TriggerAlert(const int * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Triggers an alert event for the creature AI, notifying nearby units of a
    hostile action.
  description: The TriggerAlert method is used within the CreatureAI class to initiate
    an alert state for a creature. This function typically broadcasts a notification
    to nearby friendly creatures or triggers a specific behavior such as aggroing
    enemies or changing the creature's combat stance. The method accepts a pointer
    to an integer that likely represents the entity causing the alert (such as a player
    or creature GUID). It is commonly used in scenarios where a creature needs to
    respond to hostile actions within its vicinity, ensuring coordinated responses
    among grouped mobs or faction-based behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the entity that triggered the
      alert. This could be a player GUID, creature GUID, or other identifying value.
      The value may be null if the alert is triggered by environmental factors.
  returns: None. The method performs an action and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of TriggerAlert with a player GUID
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    TriggerAlert(&player->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using TriggerAlert in response to a spell cast
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if (spellInfo->Id\
      \ == 12345)\n        TriggerAlert(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat or alert conditions and may
    affect the creature's AI state machine. It should be used carefully to avoid unintended
    behavior in group-based encounters. The parameter 'who' can be null, indicating
    that the alert was triggered by an environmental or non-specific event.
  warnings: Calling TriggerAlert with a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    depending on implementation details. Ensure that any referenced GUIDs are valid
    before passing them to this method to prevent crashes or incorrect AI responses.
