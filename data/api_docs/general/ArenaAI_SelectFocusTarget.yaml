  signature: int * ArenaAI::SelectFocusTarget(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a target player for focus in arena combat.
  description: The SelectFocusTarget method is responsible for determining which player
    to prioritize as a target during arena battles. It evaluates available opponents
    based on various factors such as threat level, health status, and proximity to
    the AI-controlled unit. This method is typically invoked by the ArenaAI class
    to make tactical decisions about which enemy to focus fire on. The returned pointer
    references a player object within the arena's context, allowing the AI to maintain
    engagement with the most strategic target.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the selected focus target
    player, or nullptr if no valid target is found. The integer value corresponds
    to the unique identifier used internally by TrinityCore for tracking players in
    arena environments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena AI logic
    code: "void ArenaAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    int* focusTarget = SelectFocusTarget(nullptr);\n\
      \    if (focusTarget != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Engage the selected target\n\
      \        Attack(*focusTarget);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the arena-specific AI behavior and may not be directly
    accessible outside of the ArenaAI context. The selection algorithm likely considers
    factors like player health, threat generated, and positioning within the arena
    boundaries. Performance is critical in arena combat scenarios where frequent targeting
    decisions must be made.
  warnings: The returned pointer should never be dereferenced directly without verifying
    it's not null. Additionally, since this method operates within an AI context,
    calling it from outside of proper arena combat state may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect targeting decisions.
