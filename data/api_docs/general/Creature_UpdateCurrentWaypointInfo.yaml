  method: UpdateCurrentWaypointInfo
  signature: void Creature::UpdateCurrentWaypointInfo(uint32 nodeId, uint32 pathId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current waypoint information for a creature based on the provided
    node and path IDs.
  description: 'The UpdateCurrentWaypointInfo method is used to update the internal
    tracking of a creature''s current position within a movement path. This method
    is typically invoked during creature movement updates to ensure that the creature''s
    waypoint state reflects its current location in the path. It allows the AI system
    to correctly manage waypoints and transitions between them, which is essential
    for proper path following behavior. The method takes two parameters: nodeId, which
    identifies the specific waypoint node within a path, and pathId, which identifies
    the movement path itself. This functionality is crucial for creatures that follow
    predefined routes such as patrol guards or scripted movement sequences.'
  parameters:
  - name: nodeId
    description: The identifier of the current waypoint node within the movement path.
      This value corresponds to a specific point in the path and is used to track
      the creature's progress along the route.
  - name: pathId
    description: The identifier of the movement path that contains the current waypoint.
      This helps distinguish between different paths a creature might be following,
      especially when multiple paths are defined for the same creature type.
  returns: null

    code: "void UpdateWaypointInfo(Creature* creature, uint32 currentNodeId, uint32\
      \ currentPathId)\n{\n    if (creature)\n    {\n        creature->UpdateCurrentWaypointInfo(currentNodeId,\
      \ currentPathId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating with AI Path Following
    code: "class CustomCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (me->IsMoving())\n        {\n          \
      \  // Simulate updating waypoint info during movement\n            uint32 nodeId\
      \ = GetNextWaypointId();\n            uint32 pathId = me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentPathId();\n\
      \            me->UpdateCurrentWaypointInfo(nodeId, pathId);\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the movement system and should
    not be invoked directly unless implementing custom movement logic. The method
    updates internal state variables used for tracking creature position in a path,
    which affects how the AI handles waypoint transitions and path completion events.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper context may lead to incorrect
    behavior in creature movement or AI decision-making. Ensure that nodeId and pathId
    values are valid and correspond to actual waypoints in the path system.
