documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players in the battlefield queue.
  description: The BroadcastPacketToQueue method broadcasts a WorldPacket to all players
    currently queued for the battlefield. This method is typically used to send updates,
    notifications, or game state changes to players waiting in the queue. The packet
    is sent asynchronously to all queued players without requiring individual player
    references. This functionality is essential for maintaining synchronized communication
    between the server and players during battlefield matchmaking and preparation
    phases.

  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Queue Update Packet
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_QUEUED, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345); // Queue ID

      battlefield->BroadcastPacketToQueue(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the battlefield's internal queue management system.
    It assumes that players are properly registered in the queue before calling this
    function. The packet is sent without any acknowledgment mechanism, so it should
    only be used for non-critical updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null WorldPacket pointer may cause
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the packet data is properly constructed and contains
    valid opcode information before broadcasting.
