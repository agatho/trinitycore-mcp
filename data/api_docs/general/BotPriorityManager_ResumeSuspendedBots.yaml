  signature: void BotPriorityManager::ResumeSuspendedBots(uint32 targetCount)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes a specified number of suspended bots in the bot priority manager.
  description: The ResumeSuspendedBots method is responsible for resuming a given
    number of bots that are currently in a suspended state within the TrinityCore
    bot system. This method operates on the internal queue or list of suspended bots,
    pulling from it and transitioning the specified number of bots back into an active
    operational state. It is typically used when bot suspension policies need to be
    adjusted dynamically, such as during maintenance windows or when system resources
    become available again. The method does not return any value but modifies the
    internal state of the bot manager.
  parameters:
  - name: targetCount
    description: The number of suspended bots to resume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing how many bots should be transitioned from suspended to active status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resume 5 Suspended Bots
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      manager->ResumeSuspendedBots(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resume All Suspended Bots
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      uint32 totalSuspended = manager->GetSuspendedBotCount();

      manager->ResumeSuspendedBots(totalSuspended);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal state tracking of suspended bots is
    properly maintained. It should only be called after ensuring that bot suspension
    logic has been applied correctly and that there are actually suspended bots to
    resume. The implementation may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety
    during state transitions.
  warnings: Calling this method with a targetCount higher than the actual number of
    suspended bots will result in resuming all available suspended bots, which might
    not be the intended behavior. Ensure proper validation before invoking this function.
