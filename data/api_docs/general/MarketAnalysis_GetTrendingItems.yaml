documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of trending items in the specified market segment
  description: The GetTrendingItems method analyzes market data to determine the number
    of items currently considered trending within a given market segment. This method
    is typically used by the auction house system to provide dynamic item recommendations
    and market insights. The method processes recent auction activity, price fluctuations,
    and demand patterns to identify items that are experiencing increased interest
    or rapid price changes. It returns an integer representing the total count of
    items classified as trending in the specified segment.
  parameters:
  - name: segment
    description: The market segment to analyze for trending items. This parameter
      determines which subset of items will be evaluated for trend analysis. Valid
      values are typically defined by the MarketSegment enumeration, such as GENERAL,
      WEAPONS, ARMOR, CONSUMABLES, etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of items currently classified
    as trending within the specified market segment. A return value of 0 indicates
    no trending items were found, while positive integers indicate the number of items
    meeting the trending criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketAnalysis analysis;\nint trendingCount = analysis.GetTrendingItems(MarketSegment::GENERAL);\n\
      if (trendingCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d trending items in general market\\\
      n\", trendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Market Segment Analysis
    code: "MarketAnalysis analysis;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    MarketSegment\
      \ segment = static_cast<MarketSegment>(i);\n    int count = analysis.GetTrendingItems(segment);\n\
      \    printf(\"Trending items in %d segment: %d\\n\", i, count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or in-memory calculations to
    determine trending items. The implementation may cache results for performance
    reasons and could be affected by recent market activity updates. The exact algorithm
    for determining trends is not specified but typically involves analyzing recent
    auction transactions, price volatility, and demand spikes.
  warnings: The method may return inconsistent results if called during periods of
    high market activity or when the market data has not been fully updated. Developers
    should consider caching results or implementing appropriate throttling mechanisms
    when calling this method frequently.
