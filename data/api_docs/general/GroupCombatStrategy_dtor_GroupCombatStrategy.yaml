  signature: void GroupCombatStrategy::~GroupCombatStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupCombatStrategy instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupCombatStrategy destructor is called automatically when a
    GroupCombatStrategy object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources used by
    the combat strategy. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor
    likely handles cleanup of internal data structures, references to player or creature
    objects, and any cached state information that was used during group combat decision-making.
    The destruction process is essential for preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    stable AI behavior in group-based encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of GroupCombatStrategy
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    GroupCombatStrategy* strategy = new GroupCombatStrategy();\n\
      \    // ... use strategy ...\n    delete strategy; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    GroupCombatStrategy strategy; // Constructor\
      \ called\n    // ... use strategy ...\n    // Destructor called automatically\
      \ when strategy goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime system during object
    destruction. Developers should not manually call destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore's AI framework, this destructor
    may be part of a larger strategy pattern where multiple combat strategies are
    dynamically allocated and destroyed based on encounter conditions.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory management.
    The destructor assumes that all internal resources have been properly initialized
    before destruction. Improper use of the destructor in conjunction with manual
    memory management can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
