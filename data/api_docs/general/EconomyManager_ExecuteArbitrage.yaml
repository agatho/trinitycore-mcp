  class: EconomyManager
  method: ExecuteArbitrage
  signature: bool EconomyManager::ExecuteArbitrage(const ArbitrageOpportunity & opportunity)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an arbitrage opportunity by performing buy/sell operations to exploit
    price differences in the economy.
  description: The ExecuteArbitrage method processes a given ArbitrageOpportunity
    object to perform profitable buy and sell transactions across different vendors
    or markets. It evaluates the opportunity's parameters, validates the transaction
    feasibility, and executes the trade sequence if conditions are met. This method
    is typically used in economic simulation or automated trading systems within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that all preconditions for the arbitrage
    are satisfied before proceeding with the actual transactions.
  parameters:
  - name: opportunity
    description: The ArbitrageOpportunity object containing details about the buy/sell
      sequence, including item ID, vendor locations, prices, and quantity to trade.
  returns: Returns true if the arbitrage opportunity was successfully executed and
    profitable; false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate insufficient
    funds, invalid item data, or transaction constraints that prevented execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arbitrage Execution
    code: "ArbitrageOpportunity opp;\nopp.itemId = 12345;\nopp.buyPrice = 100;\nopp.sellPrice\
      \ = 150;\nopp.quantity = 10;\n\nbool success = economyMgr.ExecuteArbitrage(opp);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Arbitrage completed successfully\n    printf(\"Arbitrage\
      \ executed with profit of %d gold\\n\", (150 - 100) * 10);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Failed to execute arbitrage\n    printf(\"Failed to execute arbitrage\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the economy manager has sufficient resources and
    permissions to perform the transactions. It may internally check for item availability,
    vendor stock limits, and player currency balance before proceeding with execution.
  warnings: Improperly configured ArbitrageOpportunity objects can lead to failed
    executions or unexpected behavior. Ensure all fields in the opportunity object
    are valid before calling this method.
