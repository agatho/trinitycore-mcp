  signature: void OPvPCapturePoint::ChangeState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the capture state of an OPvP objective, triggering relevant events
    and UI changes.
  description: The ChangeState method is responsible for transitioning the capture
    state of an OPvP (Open PvP) capture point. This method typically handles the logic
    required when a faction captures or loses control of a zone, including updating
    the visual representation, triggering quest events, and notifying players in the
    area. It may also manage internal flags and timers related to the capture process.
    The method is usually invoked automatically by the game engine during state transitions
    but can be called manually in certain custom implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Manual State Change Example
    code: "/* Manually trigger a capture point state change */\nOPvPCapturePoint*\
      \ capturePoint = sObjectMgr->GetOPvPCapturePoint(1234);\nif (capturePoint)\n\
      {\n    capturePoint->ChangeState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core OPvP system and should only be called when
    a legitimate state transition occurs. It's typically invoked by internal game
    systems during faction control changes, but may be overridden or extended in custom
    modules.
  warnings: Direct calls to ChangeState without proper context may cause unexpected
    behavior in quest tracking, player notifications, or UI updates. Ensure that any
    manual invocation aligns with the intended game flow and does not bypass important
    validation checks.
