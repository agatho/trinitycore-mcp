  signature: void QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestRewardDialog(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the quest reward dialog for a player when they turn in a quest.
  description: The HandleQuestRewardDialog method is responsible for managing the
    display and processing of quest rewards when a player completes a quest. It typically
    triggers the reward selection interface, handles item distribution, experience
    points, money, and other quest-specific rewards. This method ensures that all
    quest completion mechanics are properly executed and that the player receives
    appropriate rewards based on the quest's configuration. The method is usually
    invoked internally by the game engine when a player successfully turns in a quest
    to an NPC or object.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is turning
      in the quest.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Handling
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questTurnIn->HandleQuestRewardDialog(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest has already been validated as complete
    and that all prerequisites for reward distribution have been met. It should only
    be called after verifying that the player has fulfilled all quest requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the quest is properly completed may
    result in incorrect reward distribution or game state inconsistencies. The method
    does not validate whether the player has actually completed the quest before proceeding
    with reward logic.
