documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ConditionMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ConditionMgr
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the condition management
    system. This manager handles all game conditions used in various systems such
    as quest requirements, spell effects, and object interactions. The method ensures
    that only one ConditionMgr instance exists throughout the application lifecycle,
    making it thread-safe and efficient for managing conditional logic across different
    subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of ConditionMgr. The returned pointer
    is never null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ConditionMgr* conditionManager = ConditionMgr::instance();

      // Use conditionManager to access condition-related functionality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Condition Functions
    code: "ConditionMgr* cm = ConditionMgr::instance();\nif (cm->IsPlayerMeetingCondition(player,\
      \ conditionId)) {\n    // Execute conditional logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern which means that calling instance()
    multiple times will always return the same object address. The ConditionMgr singleton
    is initialized during server startup and should be available throughout the application's
    lifetime. This implementation is thread-safe as it's designed for use in a multi-threaded
    environment like TrinityCore.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating additional instances manually.
    Be cautious when using the returned pointer in multi-threaded contexts - while
    the pattern itself is thread-safe, the methods called on the instance may have
    their own thread safety requirements.
