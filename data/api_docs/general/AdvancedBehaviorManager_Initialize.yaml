  method: Initialize
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the advanced behavior manager system, setting up internal data
    structures and preparing for AI-driven NPC behavior execution.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the AdvancedBehaviorManager for operation
    by constructing necessary internal data structures, loading behavior configurations,
    and establishing required runtime states. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when a new behavior system instance needs to be activated. It
    ensures that all dependencies are resolved and that the manager is in a valid
    state before any behavior execution occurs. The initialization process may involve
    reading configuration files, registering event handlers, and preparing memory
    pools for behavior instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per manager instance. Reinitialization
    may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The method performs no locking
    internally, so if used in a multi-threaded environment, external synchronization
    may be required.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance without proper
    cleanup can cause memory corruption. Ensure that all previous behaviors are properly
    shut down before reinitializing.
