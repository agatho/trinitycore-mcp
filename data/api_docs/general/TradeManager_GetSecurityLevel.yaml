  class: TradeManager
  method: GetSecurityLevel
  signature: TradeSecurity TradeManager::GetSecurityLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the security level associated with the trade manager instance.
  description: The GetSecurityLevel method returns the TradeSecurity enumeration value
    that represents the current security clearance or privilege level of the TradeManager.
    This security level determines what actions can be performed within the trading
    context, such as initiating trades, accepting offers, or modifying trade conditions.
    The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the TradeManager.
    It is typically used to validate permissions before allowing certain trade operations
    to proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TradeSecurity enumeration value indicating the security level of this
    trade manager. Possible values may include TRADING_SECURITY_NORMAL, TRADING_SECURITY_RESTRICTED,
    or TRADING_SECURITY_ADMIN, depending on implementation details and access controls
    defined in the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Check Trade Security Level
    code: "TradeSecurity level = tradeManager.GetSecurityLevel();\nif (level == TRADING_SECURITY_ADMIN)\
      \ {\n    // Allow administrative trade operations\n    std::cout << \"Admin\
      \ trading allowed\" << std::endl;\n} else if (level == TRADING_SECURITY_NORMAL)\
      \ {\n    // Allow standard trade operations\n    std::cout << \"Standard trading\
      \ allowed\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable state data. It should
    not be used for real-time permission checking during active trades, as the security
    level might change externally.
  warnings: Do not assume that a higher security level always implies more permissions;
    the actual behavior depends on how TradeSecurity values are interpreted within
    the TrinityCore codebase.
