  signature: void LFGQueue::UpdateWaitTimeHealer(int32 waitTime, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the wait time for healer role players in the LFG queue for a specific
    dungeon.
  description: The UpdateWaitTimeHealer method is responsible for updating the average
    wait time that healer-class players have experienced while waiting in the Looking
    For Group (LFG) queue for a particular dungeon. This method is part of TrinityCore's
    LFG system and helps maintain accurate queue statistics to improve player matchmaking
    and reduce wait times. The method takes a new wait time value and a dungeon identifier,
    updating internal tracking structures accordingly. It is typically called when
    a healer player's wait time in the queue changes or needs to be recalculated based
    on current queue conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: waitTime
    description: The updated average wait time (in seconds) for healer players in
      the LFG queue for the specified dungeon. This value represents how long healers
      have waited on average for a group to form.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier of the dungeon for which the wait time is being
      updated. This corresponds to the dungeon entry in the game's database and determines
      which queue statistics are modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating healer wait time for a specific dungeon
    code: "LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);\nif (lfgQueue)\n\
      {\n    lfgQueue->UpdateWaitTimeHealer(120, 1234); // Update wait time to 2 minutes\
      \ for dungeon ID 1234\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the LFG system when healer player
    wait times are recalculated or when queue statistics are updated. It may be used
    in conjunction with other methods like UpdateWaitTimeTank and UpdateWaitTimeDps
    to maintain complete queue metrics for all roles.
