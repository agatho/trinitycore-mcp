  method: CastPsychicScream
  signature: void PriestAI::CastPsychicScream()
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Psychic Scream spell on nearby enemies within the PriestAI's threat
    range.
  description: The CastPsychicScream method executes the Psychic Scream ability for
    a priest AI unit. This spell affects all enemies within a specified radius, causing
    them to be silenced and unable to cast spells for a short duration. The method
    ensures that the spell is only cast when the priest is not in combat, the target
    is valid, and the spell is not on cooldown. It also checks for line of sight and
    range constraints before attempting to cast the spell. This ability serves as
    a key crowd control mechanic for priest characters in TrinityCore's AI system.

  - title: Basic usage within PriestAI context
    code: "void ExamplePriest::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f)\n    {\n        // Cast\
      \ Psychic Scream when health is low\n        CastPsychicScream();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the underlying AI framework's target validation and
    spell casting mechanics. It assumes that the PriestAI instance has proper initialization
    of spell data and threat management. Performance is optimized by checking preconditions
    before attempting to cast.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly from outside the AI context
    without ensuring proper state management. Improper use may lead to invalid spell
    casts or unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
