  class: Unit
  method: SendTeleportPacket
  signature: void Unit::SendTeleportPacket(const TeleportLocation & teleportLocation)
documentation:
  brief: SendTeleportPacket initiates a teleportation packet to a specified location
    for the unit.
  description: This method sends a teleportation packet to the specified TeleportLocation,
    allowing the unit (typically a player or creature) to be moved to a new position
    within the game world. The method is used internally by TrinityCore's teleportation
    system and handles the communication of teleportation data between the server
    and client. It ensures that the unit's position is updated according to the provided
    location parameters, which may include coordinates, map ID, and orientation. This
    method is typically invoked when a player or creature needs to be teleported to
    a specific location, such as during quest completion, instance entry, or other
    game mechanics involving movement.
  parameters:
  - name: teleportLocation
    description: The TeleportLocation structure containing the target coordinates,
      map ID, and orientation for the unit's teleportation. This structure defines
      where the unit should be moved to within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      TeleportLocation location;

      location.mapId = 141;

      location.x = 100.0f;

      location.y = 200.0f;

      location.z = 50.0f;

      unit->SendTeleportPacket(location);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the internal teleportation system and should only be
    used when a unit needs to be moved to a specific location. It does not perform
    any validation or checks on the provided TeleportLocation, so developers must
    ensure that the location is valid before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly from outside of TrinityCore's
    internal teleportation system without proper context. Calling it incorrectly may
    result in client-side inconsistencies or invalid position updates.
