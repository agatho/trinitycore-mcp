  class: MoveSplineInitArgs
  method: Validate
  signature: bool MoveSplineInitArgs::Validate(const Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the movement spline arguments for a unit, ensuring they are within
    acceptable bounds and consistent with game mechanics.
  description: The Validate method checks whether the movement spline initialization
    arguments stored in the MoveSplineInitArgs object are valid for the specified
    Unit. It performs various consistency checks to ensure that the spline parameters
    (such as waypoints, speed, orientation, and movement flags) conform to expected
    values and do not violate game logic or engine constraints. This validation is
    crucial before initiating movement operations to prevent invalid or undefined
    behavior in the game world. The method typically returns true if all validations
    pass, and false otherwise. It may also perform checks related to unit state, such
    as whether the unit is currently moving or in a valid position for spline-based
    movement.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: A pointer to the Unit object for which the movement spline arguments
      are being validated. This parameter defines the context and constraints under
      which validation occurs, such as unit state, movement flags, and physical properties.
  returns: Returns true if all movement spline arguments are valid for the given unit;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one or more validation
    checks failed, potentially due to invalid waypoints, inconsistent speed values,
    or incompatible movement states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "MoveSplineInitArgs args;\n// ... populate args with spline data ...\nUnit*\
      \ player = ...;\nif (args.Validate(player)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ initialization\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid spline arguments\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Movement Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player, const MoveSplineInitArgs& args)\
      \ {\n    if (!args.Validate(player)) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid movement\
      \ spline for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n        return;\n   \
      \ }\n    // Proceed with actual movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    before executing a spline-based movement. Developers should be aware that this
    function may perform expensive checks involving unit state and world bounds, so
    it should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful validation guarantees that the movement
    will execute without error; additional runtime checks may still be required. Also,
    passing null or invalid Unit pointers to this method can lead to undefined behavior.
