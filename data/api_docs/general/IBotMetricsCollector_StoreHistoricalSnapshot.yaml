  signature: void IBotMetricsCollector::StoreHistoricalSnapshot()
documentation:
  brief: Stores a historical snapshot of bot metrics data for later analysis and reporting.
  description: The StoreHistoricalSnapshot method captures the current state of bot-related
    performance and operational metrics and persists them into a historical data store.
    This allows administrators and developers to track trends, identify performance
    bottlenecks, and analyze bot behavior over time. The method is typically invoked
    periodically or upon specific events such as server maintenance or major updates.
    It ensures that all collected metrics are saved in a structured format suitable
    for database storage or file-based logging systems.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* collector = GetBotMetricsCollector();

      // Store current metrics snapshot

      collector->StoreHistoricalSnapshot();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be blocking depending on the underlying storage mechanism.
    It's recommended to call this method asynchronously if performance is critical.
    The actual data persistence strategy (e.g., database vs. file) depends on the
    implementation of IBotMetricsCollector.
