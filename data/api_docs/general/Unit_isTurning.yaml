  method: isTurning
  signature: bool Unit::isTurning() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently turning.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object is in the process of turning,
    which typically occurs when the unit is rotating its orientation to face a specific
    direction. The function returns true when the unit's turning state is active,
    indicating that the unit is actively performing a turn operation. This functionality
    is commonly used in game mechanics involving movement and positioning, particularly
    in scenarios where units need to face certain directions during combat or other
    activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently turning, false otherwise. The method
    does not return null as it is a boolean function.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->isTurning()) {\n    // Perform actions while turning\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related functions
    to determine if a unit is actively rotating its orientation. It may be used in
    combat situations where the unit needs to turn to face an enemy or target.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking if
    a unit is moving, as turning and movement are distinct states. The method may
    return false even when the unit is actively rotating its orientation.
