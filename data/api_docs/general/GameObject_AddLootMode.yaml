  brief: Adds a loot mode to the GameObject's loot list.
  description: This method adds a specified loot mode to the GameObject's loot list,
    allowing for different loot modes to be applied to the same object. The loot mode
    determines how loot is distributed among players, with each mode representing
    a specific set of rules or conditions for loot distribution. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with other loot-related methods to manage the loot behavior
    of GameObjects within the game world.

    loot mode list of the GameObject. It should be called before any loot distribution
    occurs.
