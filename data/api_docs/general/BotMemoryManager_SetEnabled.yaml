  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot memory manager functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BotMemoryManager is active
    and processing memory-related operations for AI bots. When enabled, the manager
    handles memory allocation, deallocation, and caching of bot-specific data structures.
    When disabled, the manager ceases all memory operations to prevent interference
    with other systems or to temporarily suspend bot behavior. This method is typically
    used during server initialization, configuration changes, or when transitioning
    between different game states where bot memory management should be active or
    inactive.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Memory Manager
    code: BotMemoryManager::instance()->SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Memory Manager
    code: BotMemoryManager::instance()->SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or configuration reloads.
    The manager's state affects all bots that rely on memory caching and allocation
    features. Changes to the enabled state may not take effect immediately if there
    are active bot operations in progress.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively using memory resources may
    cause undefined behavior or memory corruption. It is recommended to ensure no
    active bot operations are occurring before changing the manager's enabled state.
