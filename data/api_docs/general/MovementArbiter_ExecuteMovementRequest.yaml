  signature: void MovementArbiter::ExecuteMovementRequest(const MovementRequest &
    request)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes a movement request for an object within the game world.
  description: The ExecuteMovementRequest method handles the processing of a MovementRequest
    object, which typically contains information about desired movement actions such
    as position changes, speed adjustments, or pathfinding instructions. This method
    is part of the MovementArbiter class responsible for managing and arbitrating
    movement commands in TrinityCore's game engine. It ensures that movement requests
    are properly validated, queued, and executed according to game rules and object
    constraints. The method integrates with the broader movement system to maintain
    synchronization between client and server-side object positions.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A const reference to a MovementRequest object containing the movement
      command details including target position, speed, orientation, and movement
      type. This parameter must be properly initialized with valid movement data before
      calling the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Request Execution
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.targetPosition = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      request.speed = 4.5f;

      request.movementType = MovementType::RUN;


      movementArbiter.ExecuteMovementRequest(request);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Movement with Pathfinding
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.targetPosition = Position(500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f);

      request.movementType = MovementType::PATHFINDING;

      request.speed = 3.0f;

      request.flags = MovementFlags::MOVEFLAG_RUN_MODE;


      movementArbiter.ExecuteMovementRequest(request);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's movement update loop
    or when processing network messages containing movement data. The actual execution
    may be deferred or queued depending on the current state of the object and server
    load. Developers should ensure that MovementRequest objects are properly validated
    before passing them to this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or malformed MovementRequest can lead
    to undefined behavior or client desynchronization. Always validate movement data
    before execution, especially when dealing with user input or network data. The
    method does not perform any automatic validation of the request parameters.
