  method: InitializeKeywordMappings
  signature: void GossipHandler::InitializeKeywordMappings()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the keyword mappings used for handling gossip interactions in
    the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The InitializeKeywordMappings method sets up internal data structures
    that map user-defined keywords to specific gossip options or actions within the
    TrinityCore server. This method is typically invoked during the initialization
    phase of the GossipHandler class to ensure that all available keywords are properly
    registered and can be processed when players interact with NPCs through gossip
    menus. It prepares the system for dynamic keyword-based responses, allowing for
    flexible and extensible NPC dialogue systems without requiring hard-coded logic
    for each interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'GossipHandler handler;

      handler.InitializeKeywordMappings();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of the GossipHandler
    instance. Reinitializing keyword mappings after they have been set may lead to
    unexpected behavior or duplicate entries in internal lookup tables.
