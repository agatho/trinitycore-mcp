documentation:
  brief: Sets the gold amount for the current trade session
  description: The SetTradeGold method updates the gold amount that is being offered
    in the ongoing trade between two players. This method is typically used during
    the trading process to specify how much gold a player wishes to trade. The method
    validates the provided gold amount against the player's available gold and the
    trade constraints before applying the change. It ensures that the trade remains
    within valid bounds and does not exceed the player's inventory limits or the maximum
    allowed trade gold.
  parameters:
  - name: gold
    description: The amount of gold to set for the current trade session. Must be
      a non-negative value representing the number of copper coins (1 gold = 100 silver
      = 10000 copper). The value should not exceed the player's available gold balance
      or the maximum allowed trade gold limit.
  returns: Returns true if the gold amount was successfully set for the trade session,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the provided gold amount is invalid,
    exceeds the player's available balance, or violates trade constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Trade Gold Amount
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nTradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();\n\
      bool success = tradeMgr->SetTradeGold(5000); // Sets 50 silver (5000 copper)\
      \ for trade\nif (success)\n{\n    // Gold amount successfully set\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Trade Gold with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nTradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();\n\
      uint64 playerGold = player->GetMoney();\nuint64 tradeGold = 100000; // 10 gold\n\
      if (tradeGold <= playerGold)\n{\n    bool success = tradeMgr->SetTradeGold(tradeGold);\n\
      \    if (!success)\n    {\n        // Handle error case - possibly due to trade\
      \ limits or other constraints\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough gold in\
      \ player's inventory\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the trade system and should only be called during
    an active trade session. The implementation likely includes checks for valid gold
    amounts, player balance validation, and trade limit enforcement. It may also trigger
    UI updates or network messages to notify other party members of the updated trade
    state.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid trade session may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the gold amount provided is within reasonable
    bounds and does not exceed the player's actual gold inventory. Incorrect usage
    could lead to invalid trade states or client/server desynchronization.
