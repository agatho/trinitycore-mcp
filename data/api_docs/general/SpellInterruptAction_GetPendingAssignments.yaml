  method: GetPendingAssignments
  signature: int SpellInterruptAction::GetPendingAssignments(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of pending spell interrupt assignments for a bot AI
    instance.
  description: The GetPendingAssignments method returns an integer value representing
    the count of spell interrupt actions that are currently pending assignment or
    execution within the specified BotAI context. This method is typically used in
    the context of TrinityCore's AI system to manage and monitor spell casting behaviors,
    particularly for bots that need to interrupt enemy spells. The returned value
    indicates how many spell interrupts are queued for processing, which can be useful
    for determining when to trigger new interrupt actions or when to wait for current
    ones to complete. This method does not modify any internal state but rather provides
    a read-only view of the pending assignments.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of pending spell interrupt assignments.
    A return value of zero indicates no pending assignments, while positive values
    indicate the count of assignments awaiting processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int pending = botAI->GetPendingAssignments();\nif (pending > 0) {\n   \
      \ // Process pending spell interrupts\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"SpellInterruptAction\"\
      , \"{} pending assignments found\", pending);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInterruptAction class and is typically called
    within AI decision-making loops to evaluate current interrupt queue status. The
    implementation likely checks internal data structures that track spell interrupt
    tasks assigned to the bot AI instance.
