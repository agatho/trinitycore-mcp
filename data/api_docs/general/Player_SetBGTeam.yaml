  class: Player
  method: SetBGTeam
  signature: void Player::SetBGTeam(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's battleground team to the specified team.
  description: The SetBGTeam method assigns a player to a specific battleground team,
    either Alliance (team 0) or Horde (team 1), which determines their faction and
    team affiliation during battleground matches. This method is typically used during
    battleground preparation or when joining a battleground instance. The player's
    team assignment affects their gameplay mechanics, including faction-based rewards,
    team-based objectives, and the ability to participate in battleground activities.
    This method does not directly affect the player's character creation or other
    general gameplay attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team value to assign to the player. 0 represents Alliance, 1
      represents Horde. Any value other than 0 or 1 will result in an invalid assignment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetBGTeam(0); // Assign to Alliance team'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->GetTeam() == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n\
      {\n    player->SetBGTeam(1); // Switch to Horde team\n}\nelse\n{\n    player->SetBGTeam(0);\
      \ // Switch to Alliance team\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during battleground instances, as it
    affects the player's team-based gameplay. The assignment of team affects the player's
    faction and rewards during battleground matches. This method is typically called
    during battleground preparation or when joining a battleground instance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect team assignments during
    battlegrounds, potentially causing gameplay issues or mismatches in faction-based
    rewards. Avoid calling this method outside of battleground contexts unless explicitly
    required.
