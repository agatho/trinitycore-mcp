  signature: bool SceneObject::ShouldBeRemoved() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the scene object should be removed from the world.
  description: The ShouldBeRemoved method evaluates the internal state of a SceneObject
    to determine if it is marked for removal from the game world. This typically occurs
    when the object has completed its lifecycle, such as after a scene animation finishes
    or when the object is no longer needed. The method checks various conditions including
    object validity, active state, and completion flags. It's commonly used by the
    core game loop to identify objects that can be safely destroyed and cleaned up
    from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scene object should be removed from the world; otherwise
    returns false if the object is still valid and should remain in the game state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "if (sceneObject->ShouldBeRemoved())\n{\n    // Remove object from world\n\
      \    sceneObject->RemoveFromWorld();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with scene manager
    code: "void SceneManager::UpdateSceneObjects()\n{\n    for (auto it = m_sceneObjects.begin();\
      \ it != m_sceneObjects.end();)\n    {\n        if ((*it)->ShouldBeRemoved())\n\
      \        {\n            (*it)->RemoveFromWorld();\n            it = m_sceneObjects.erase(it);\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            ++it;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the game's update cycle to perform
    cleanup operations. The implementation may check internal flags like 'isRemoved',
    'isActive', or completion status. It's important to note that objects marked for
    removal should not be accessed after this method returns true, as they may be
    destroyed at any moment.
  warnings: Calling methods on a scene object after ShouldBeRemoved() returns true
    can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always check the return value before
    performing operations on the object. The method does not perform the actual removal;
    it only indicates whether removal should occur.
