  class: FollowerAI
  method: AddFollowState
  signature: void FollowerAI::AddFollowState(int followState)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the follow state of the follower AI to the specified state value.
  description: The AddFollowState method is used to set or modify the current follow
    state of a FollowerAI instance. This method allows the AI to track and manage
    its current behavioral state while following a player or entity. The follow state
    typically controls how the NPC behaves during the follow process, such as whether
    it is actively following, waiting, or has completed the follow action. This method
    is generally called internally by the TrinityCore framework when managing follower
    behavior, but can also be invoked directly to manipulate the AI's follow state
    for custom scripting or gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: followState
    description: An integer value representing the desired follow state. Valid values
      are typically defined as constants within the FollowerAI class or related enums,
      such as FOLLOW_NONE, FOLLOW_START, FOLLOW_FOLLOW, FOLLOW_COMPLETE, etc. The
      specific meaning of each state depends on the implementation and game context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a follower to start following
    code: "void MyCustomAI::StartFollowing(Player* player)\n{\n    // Set the follow\
      \ state to indicate that we're starting to follow\n    AddFollowState(FOLLOW_START);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for starting the follow process\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a follower to complete following
    code: "void MyCustomAI::CompleteFollowing()\n{\n    // Set the follow state to\
      \ indicate that we've completed following\n    AddFollowState(FOLLOW_COMPLETE);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for completing the follow process\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other FollowerAI methods
    like UpdateAI, GetFollowState, and SetFollowState. It's important to understand
    that the exact behavior of each follow state may vary depending on how it's implemented
    within the specific AI subclass. The method does not perform any validation on
    the input value, so invalid states might lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Directly calling AddFollowState without proper context or understanding
    of the follow state system may result in unexpected AI behavior. It is recommended
    to use predefined constants or enums for follow states to ensure compatibility
    and avoid errors.
