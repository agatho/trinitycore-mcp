  class: BotProfiler
  method: IntegratePerformanceMonitor
  signature: void BotProfiler::IntegratePerformanceMonitor()
documentation:
  brief: Integrates the performance monitor into the bot profiler to track and analyze
    bot behavior metrics.
  description: The IntegratePerformanceMonitor method initializes and connects the
    performance monitoring system within the BotProfiler class. This integration allows
    the profiler to collect detailed data about bot execution times, resource usage,
    and overall performance characteristics during gameplay. The method likely sets
    up callbacks or hooks into the TrinityCore framework's timing and profiling subsystems
    to gather real-time metrics from bot operations. It is designed to work seamlessly
    with existing bot management systems and provides insights into how efficiently
    bots are executing their assigned tasks.

  - title: Basic Integration Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.IntegratePerformanceMonitor();

      // Performance monitoring is now active for all bots managed by this profiler'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of a bot system. The performance data collected may impact overall server performance
    if not properly configured, so consider using it in development or testing environments
    initially.
