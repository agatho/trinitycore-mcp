documentation:
  brief: Sets the original caster GUID for a spell cast extra arguments object
  description: The SetOriginalCaster method assigns the GUID of the original caster
    to the CastSpellExtraArgs object. This is used in spell casting mechanics to track
    which entity originally initiated a spell, particularly important for effects
    that may be reflected or redirected. The method modifies the object in-place and
    returns a reference to allow for method chaining. This is typically used when
    setting up spell cast parameters before invoking spell casting functions within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the original caster entity. This
      should be a valid object GUID from the World of Warcraft instance, typically
      representing a player, creature, or game object that initiated the spell.
  returns: A reference to the modified CastSpellExtraArgs object, enabling method
    chaining for fluent API usage.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Original Caster for Spell Casting
    code: 'CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetOriginalCaster(player->GetGUID());

      // Use args in spell casting function

      spellCastResult = player->CastSpell(target, spellId, args);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining with Original Caster
    code: "CastSpellExtraArgs args;\nargs.SetOriginalCaster(player->GetGUID())\n \
      \   .SetCastTime(1000)\n    .SetTriggered(true);\nplayer->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, args);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell casting infrastructure in TrinityCore and
    is essential for maintaining proper spell tracking and effects. The GUID parameter
    should be validated to ensure it represents a valid object within the game world
    before being set.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the original caster GUID may lead to unexpected behavior
    in spell effects, particularly those that depend on the caster's identity for
    damage calculation, aura application, or targeting logic.
