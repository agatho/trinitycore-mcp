  class: IResourceSystem
  method: GeneratePrimary
  signature: void IResourceSystem::GeneratePrimary(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates primary resources for the system based on the specified amount.
  description: The GeneratePrimary method is responsible for creating or allocating
    primary resources within the IResourceSystem. This method typically handles the
    core resource generation logic, such as producing currency, items, or other fundamental
    game assets. The generated resources are usually added to the system's internal
    resource pool and may trigger related events or updates. This method does not
    return any value but modifies the state of the resource system. It is commonly
    used during gameplay events, player actions, or system initialization when primary
    resources need to be created.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of primary resources to generate. This parameter determines
      how many units of the primary resource will be created and added to the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Generate 100 Gold Coins
    code: 'IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = GetResourceSystem();

      resourceSystem->GeneratePrimary(100); // Generates 100 units of primary resource
      (e.g., gold)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Resource Generation Based on Player Level
    code: 'IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = GetResourceSystem();

      uint32 playerLevel = player->GetLevel();

      uint32 generatedAmount = playerLevel * 10;

      resourceSystem->GeneratePrimary(generatedAmount); // Generates resources based
      on player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically synchronous and modifies the internal state of the
    resource system. It may internally call other resource management functions to
    ensure proper allocation and distribution of generated resources. The exact nature
    of 'primary' resources depends on the specific implementation of IResourceSystem
    in use.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is non-negative, as negative values may
    cause unexpected behavior or errors in resource generation logic. This method
    should not be called during critical sections where resource consistency is required
    without proper locking mechanisms.
