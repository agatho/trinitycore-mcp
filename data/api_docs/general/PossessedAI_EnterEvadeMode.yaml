  signature: void PossessedAI::EnterEvadeMode(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Puts the possessed creature into evade mode, causing it to return to its
    initial position and orientation.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used by the PossessedAI class to handle
    the behavior when a possessed creature should return to its original state or
    location. This typically occurs when the possessor (such as a player) leaves combat
    or loses control of the creature. The method resets the creature's AI state, stops
    any ongoing actions, and initiates movement back to the creature's spawn position.
    It is commonly invoked during player dismounting, combat end, or when the possession
    effect expires.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Possession Event
    code: "void OnPossessEnd(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Creature* creature = player->GetVehicleCreature())\n\
      \    {\n        creature->GetAI()->EnterEvadeMode();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system for creatures that are controlled by
    players or other entities. It ensures proper cleanup and state restoration when
    possession ends, preventing the creature from remaining in an inconsistent AI
    state.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when appropriate, as calling it
    prematurely may interrupt ongoing combat or important actions. The method does
    not validate if the creature is actually possessed before executing.
