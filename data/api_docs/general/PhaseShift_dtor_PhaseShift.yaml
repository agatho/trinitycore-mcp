  class: PhaseShift
  method: ~PhaseShift
  signature: void PhaseShift::~PhaseShift()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PhaseShift object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PhaseShift destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a PhaseShift object. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, PhaseShift objects manage phase-based
    visibility and interaction states for players and game entities. This destructor
    ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures such as phase masks, associated
    GUIDs, and any cached phase information. It is automatically invoked when a PhaseShift
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, ensuring no memory leaks occur
    in the server's phase management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of PhaseShift object
    code: 'PhaseShift* shift = new PhaseShift();

      // ... use the PhaseShift object ...

      delete shift; // Triggers ~PhaseShift() destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void Function()\n{\n    PhaseShift shift;\n    // ... use shift ...\n}\
      \ // ~PhaseShift() called automatically when shift goes out of scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to note that PhaseShift objects are typically
    managed through smart pointers or automatic storage duration to prevent memory
    leaks. The destructor ensures that any phase-related data structures are properly
    deallocated without leaving dangling references.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Since this is a destructor, it should never be called directly
    by user code. Also, ensure that all references to the PhaseShift object are cleared
    before deletion to avoid use-after-free scenarios.
