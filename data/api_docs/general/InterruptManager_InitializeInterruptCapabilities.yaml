  signature: void InterruptManager::InitializeInterruptCapabilities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes interrupt capabilities for the InterruptManager, setting up internal
    state and configurations required for handling spell and ability interruptions.
  description: The InitializeInterruptCapabilities method prepares the InterruptManager
    class for managing spell and ability interruptions within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically sets up internal data structures, registers necessary callbacks,
    or initializes configuration parameters needed to determine when and how interrupts
    should be processed. It is generally called during system initialization or when
    the interrupt manager needs to be reset or reconfigured. The method ensures that
    all required subsystems are ready to handle interruption events such as spell
    casting being interrupted by damage, movement, or other game actions. This method
    does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations; its primary
    purpose is to prepare the object's internal state for subsequent interrupt handling
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = new InterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->InitializeInterruptCapabilities();

      // Now the interrupt manager is ready to handle interruptions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of the TrinityCore server or when reinitializing the interrupt system. It may
    perform operations that are not thread-safe, so it's recommended to call this
    method from a single-threaded context during startup. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal state variables that affect how interruptions
    are processed.
