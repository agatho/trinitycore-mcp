documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BattlePetInfo object with default values.
  description: The BattlePetInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the BattlePetInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values for battle
    pet information. This method is typically called when creating a new battle pet
    data object within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized to their default states, which may include
    setting pet identifiers, stats, and other relevant properties to neutral or zero
    values. This initialization is crucial for maintaining data integrity before the
    object is populated with actual battle pet data from the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BattlePetInfo instance
    code: 'BattlePetInfo petInfo;

      // petInfo is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database lookups or external data fetching.
    It only initializes the object's internal state. The BattlePetInfo class likely
    requires additional methods to populate it with actual battle pet data from the
    game world or database.
