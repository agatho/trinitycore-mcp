  class: AuraScript
  method: HasEffectType
  signature: bool AuraScript::HasEffectType(int type) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the aura has a specific effect type applied.
  description: The HasEffectType method determines whether the current aura script
    instance contains a specific effect type. This is commonly used in AuraScript
    implementations to conditionally execute logic based on the presence of certain
    aura effects. The method iterates through all active effects of the aura and returns
    true if any effect matches the specified type. This functionality is essential
    for implementing complex aura behaviors where actions depend on the types of effects
    present.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura has at least one effect of the specified type;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void Register()\
      \ override\n    {\n        OnEffectApply += AuraEffectApplyFn(MyAuraScript::OnApply,\
      \ EFFECT_0, SPELL_AURA_DUMMY);\n    }\n\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect const*\
      \ effect)\n    {\n        if (HasEffectType(SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE))\n \
      \       {\n            // Handle case where aura has school damage effect\n\
      \            return;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all active effects of the aura,
    so performance may be impacted for auras with many effects. It's recommended to
    cache the result if the check is performed frequently within the same context.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths
    as it iterates over all effects. Also ensure that the effect type constant passed
    matches the intended spell effect, as incorrect values may lead to unexpected
    behavior.
