  class: ArenaAI
  method: ShouldPillarKite
  signature: bool ArenaAI::ShouldPillarKite(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the arena AI should use pillar kiting behavior for the
    specified player.
  description: The ShouldPillarKite method evaluates if the ArenaAI instance should
    employ a pillar kiting strategy for a given player during arena combat. This behavior
    typically involves positioning the player near environmental pillars to avoid
    incoming attacks while maintaining optimal distance from enemies. The method likely
    considers factors such as player health, enemy positioning, available cover, and
    combat state to make this decision. It is part of the AI's tactical decision-making
    process in arena environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should execute pillar kiting behavior for the player;
    otherwise returns false. The method may use internal state or external conditions
    to determine this value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat logic
    code: "if (arenaAI->ShouldPillarKite(&playerGuid)) {\n    // Execute pillar kiting\
      \ behavior\n    player->SetFacingToObject(pillarObject);\n    player->MovePositionToFirstValidOrientation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used within the context of arena AI decision trees
    where various combat behaviors are evaluated. The implementation may depend on
    current game state, such as player health percentage, proximity to enemies, and
    environmental factors like available pillars.
