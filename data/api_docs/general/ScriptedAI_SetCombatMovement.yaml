  class: ScriptedAI
  method: SetCombatMovement
  signature: void ScriptedAI::SetCombatMovement(bool allowMovement)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables combat movement for the AI-controlled creature.
  description: The SetCombatMovement method controls whether an AI-controlled creature
    can move during combat. When enabled, the creature may perform movement actions
    such as chasing enemies or repositioning itself. When disabled, the creature will
    remain stationary while in combat. This method is typically used to control AI
    behavior during specific combat phases or boss encounters where movement needs
    to be restricted or allowed.
  parameters:
  - name: allowMovement
    description: Boolean flag that determines if movement is allowed during combat.
      True enables movement, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable movement during boss encounter
    code: "void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(Unit* who)\n{\n    ScriptedAI::JustEngagedWith(who);\n\
      \    SetCombatMovement(false);\n    // Creature will not move during combat\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Enable movement after special ability
    code: "void BossAI::DoSpecialAbility()\n{\n    SetCombatMovement(true);\n    //\
      \ Allow movement again after using special ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's AI state and movement behavior.
    It should be called during appropriate combat states to ensure proper AI execution.
    The setting persists until explicitly changed.
  warnings: Calling this method during combat without proper context may cause unexpected
    AI behavior. Ensure that disabling movement does not leave the creature in an
    unattackable or unreachable state for players.
