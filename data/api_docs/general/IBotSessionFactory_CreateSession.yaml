  class: IBotSessionFactory
  method: CreateSession
  signature: std::shared_ptr<IBotSession> IBotSessionFactory::CreateSession(uint32
    accountId, int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot session for the specified account and character.
  description: The CreateSession method initializes and returns a new instance of
    IBotSession associated with the given account identifier and character GUID. This
    session represents an active bot connection within the TrinityCore framework,
    allowing for interaction with game mechanics such as movement, combat, and quest
    handling. The method typically handles session setup, validation of account and
    character data, and allocation of necessary resources for bot operation. It is
    designed to be called when a new bot instance needs to be established, often during
    login or character selection processes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier for the player account. Must be a valid, existing
      account in the database.
  - name: characterGuid
    description: Global unique identifier for the character. Should correspond to
      an existing character belonging to the specified account.
  returns: A shared pointer to the newly created IBotSession instance. Returns nullptr
    if session creation fails due to invalid parameters, missing data, or resource
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Creation
    code: "std::shared_ptr<IBotSession> session = sessionFactory->CreateSession(12345,\
      \ 67890);\nif (session)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling During Session Creation
    code: "auto session = sessionFactory->CreateSession(0, -1);\nif (!session)\n{\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to create bot session\" << std::endl;\n    // Handle\
      \ error appropriately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the bot initialization phase. The
    returned session object should be managed carefully using smart pointers to prevent
    memory leaks. Session creation may involve database lookups and validation steps,
    which could introduce slight delays.
  warnings: Passing invalid account IDs or character GUIDs may result in failed session
    creation. Ensure that the provided identifiers correspond to valid entries in
    the database before calling this method. The method does not perform automatic
    cleanup of failed sessions.
