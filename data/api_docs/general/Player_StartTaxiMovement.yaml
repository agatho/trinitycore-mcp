api:
  class: Player
  method: StartTaxiMovement
  signature: void Player::StartTaxiMovement(uint32 mountDisplayId, uint32 path, uint32
    pathNode, int speed, int param4)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a taxi movement for the player using specified mount display ID
    and path.
  description: The StartTaxiMovement method begins a taxi journey for the player character,
    allowing them to travel through the air using a specified mount. This method is
    typically used when a player needs to fly between locations or when a taxi route
    is being activated. The method requires a mount display ID and path information
    to properly initiate the movement. It handles the transition from ground-based
    movement to flight-based movement, and can be used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods for complex travel scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: mountDisplayId
    description: The display ID of the mount being used for taxi travel. This determines
      how the player appears while flying.
  - name: path
    description: The path ID that defines which taxi route to take. This is typically
      a reference to a specific path in the database.
  - name: pathNode
    description: The node within the path to start from. This indicates where along
      the path the player should begin their journey.
  - name: speed
    description: The speed at which the player will travel during the taxi movement.
      This affects how fast the player moves through the air.
  - name: param4
    description: Additional parameter that may be used for specific implementation
      details or customizations of the taxi movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taxi Movement Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->StartTaxiMovement(12345, 67890, 1, 100, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Taxi Movement Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 mountId = 12345;

      uint32 pathId = 67890;

      uint32 node = 1;

      int speed = 100;

      int param4 = 0;

      player->StartTaxiMovement(mountId, pathId, node, speed, param4);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include the fact that this method may trigger a change
    in player movement state from ground-based to flight-based. Performance considerations
    involve ensuring that the mount display ID and path are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid values could cause errors or unexpected behavior. Thread safety
    is not an issue since this method typically operates within a single-threaded
    context.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a state where
    taxi movement is allowed. Calling it outside of proper conditions may result in
    undefined behavior or errors. Also, ensure that the path and node parameters are
    valid to avoid issues with the taxi route.
