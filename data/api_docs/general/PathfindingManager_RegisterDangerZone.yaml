  signature: void PathfindingManager::RegisterDangerZone(const DangerZone & zone)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a danger zone with the pathfinding manager for avoidance during
    navigation.
  description: The RegisterDangerZone method adds a specified danger zone to the pathfinding
    manager's internal list of areas that should be avoided during path calculation.
    This allows NPCs and units to dynamically adjust their movement paths to avoid
    dangerous regions such as explosive areas, hazardous terrain, or hostile zones.
    The method takes a constant reference to a DangerZone object which contains the
    necessary information about the zone's boundaries and danger properties. Once
    registered, the pathfinding system will consider this zone when computing valid
    routes for units.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: A constant reference to a DangerZone object that defines the area
      and properties of the danger zone to be registered. This includes position,
      radius, and danger type information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Danger Zone Registration
    code: 'DangerZone zone;

      zone.center = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      zone.radius = 50.0f;

      zone.type = DangerType::EXPLOSIVE;

      pathfindingManager->RegisterDangerZone(zone);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Danger Zones
    code: "std::vector<DangerZone> dangerZones;\n// Populate dangerZones with various\
      \ danger zone definitions\nfor (const auto& zone : dangerZones)\n{\n    pathfindingManager->RegisterDangerZone(zone);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or when dynamic environmental
    changes occur in the game world. The registered zones are used by the pathfinding
    algorithms to compute safer routes for units. It's important to note that this
    registration is not persistent across server restarts and must be re-registered
    after server resets.
  warnings: Registering too many danger zones simultaneously may impact performance
    of pathfinding calculations. Ensure that zone definitions are valid and do not
    overlap excessively with other registered zones, as this could lead to unexpected
    behavior in path computation.
