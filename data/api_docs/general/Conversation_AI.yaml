  signature: ConversationAI * Conversation::AI()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI instance associated with the conversation.
  description: The Conversation::AI method retrieves the ConversationAI object that
    controls the behavior and logic of the conversation. This method is typically
    used to access or manipulate the AI-driven aspects of a conversation, such as
    dialogue flow, NPC responses, and interaction states. The returned pointer provides
    direct access to the conversation's AI functionality within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method should only be called on valid conversation objects that have been
    properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ConversationAI instance associated with this conversation.
    Returns nullptr if the conversation has not been properly initialized or if no
    AI is assigned to it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Conversation* conv = ...; // Get a conversation instance\nConversationAI*\
      \ ai = conv->AI();\nif (ai)\n{\n    // Use the AI instance for further operations\n\
      \    ai->Update(time); // Example of using the AI\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking AI Existence Before Use
    code: "Conversation* conv = ...;\nConversationAI* ai = conv->AI();\nif (ai !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to use the AI\n    ai->SendNextDialog();\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no AI is present\n    sLog->outError(\"Conversation\
      \ has no AI assigned\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the conversation object is valid and properly initialized.
    The returned ConversationAI pointer should not be deleted or managed by the caller,
    as it's owned by the conversation object itself. Accessing this AI instance allows
    for dynamic modification of conversation behavior during runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or destroyed conversation object
    may result in undefined behavior or segmentation faults. Always verify that the
    conversation is valid before calling this method and check for null return values
    before using the returned pointer.
