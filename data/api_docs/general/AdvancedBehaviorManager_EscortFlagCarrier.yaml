  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: EscortFlagCarrier
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::EscortFlagCarrier(Player * carrier)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates escort behavior for a player carrying the flag in a battleground
    or arena.
  description: The EscortFlagCarrier method is responsible for managing the AI behavior
    of a player who is currently carrying a flag during battlegrounds or arena matches.
    This method typically handles the logic for how the flagged player should be escorted
    or protected by nearby friendly units, ensuring proper flag capture mechanics
    and preventing the carrier from being easily killed while holding the objective.
    The method likely modifies the carrier's movement patterns, sets appropriate AI
    states, and may trigger visual effects or notifications to other players in the
    area. It is part of the advanced behavior management system that governs complex
    NPC and player interactions during competitive game modes.
  parameters:
  - name: carrier
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is currently carrying the flag.
      This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to a player instance that is
      actively participating in a battleground or arena where flag capture mechanics
      are enabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Escort Flag Carrier Usage
    code: "void HandleFlagCapture(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->IsInBattleground())\n\
      \    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->EscortFlagCarrier(player);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Escort with Custom AI Logic
    code: "void CustomFlagCarrierAI(Player* carrier)\n{\n    if (carrier && carrier->IsInBattleground()\
      \ && carrier->HasFlagInBattleground())\n    {\n        // Set custom escort\
      \ behavior\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->EscortFlagCarrier(carrier);\n\
      \        \n        // Additional logic for protecting the carrier\n        carrier->SetFlagProtection(true);\n\
      \        carrier->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You are carrying the flag!\");\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the battleground system
    when a player picks up a flag. Developers should ensure that the carrier parameter
    is properly validated before calling this method, as passing a null or invalid
    pointer may result in undefined behavior. The method likely interacts with internal
    AI state machines and may modify the carrier's current movement and combat behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player is indeed carrying
    a flag may lead to incorrect AI behavior or potential crashes. Additionally, this
    method should only be called within appropriate battleground contexts where flag
    mechanics are active, as it may not function correctly in regular world zones.
