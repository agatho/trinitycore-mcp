documentation:
  brief: Clears all menu options from the player's current interaction menu
  description: The ClearMenus method removes all available menu options and choices
    from the player's active interaction menu. This method is typically called when
    a player's menu state needs to be reset, such as when switching between different
    NPC interactions, closing dialogues, or clearing temporary menu selections. The
    method ensures that no stale menu entries remain in memory and prevents potential
    conflicts with new menu states. It operates on the player's current menu context
    without affecting other player data or game state elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Menu Clearing
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      playerMenu->ClearMenus();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Menus Before New Interaction
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    // Clear\
      \ any existing menus\n    player->GetPlayerMenu()->ClearMenus();\n    \n   \
      \ // Add new menu options\n    player->GetPlayerMenu()->AddMenuItem(0, 1, \"\
      Buy Items\", GOSSIP_OPTION_VENDOR);\n    player->GetPlayerMenu()->AddMenuItem(0,\
      \ 2, \"Learn Skills\", GOSSIP_OPTION_TRAINER);\n    \n    player->SEND_GOSSIP_MENU(DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE,\
      \ creature->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    handling gossip interactions and menu transitions. It's important to note that
    clearing menus does not automatically send any updates to the client - you must
    manually call SEND_GOSSIP_MENU or similar methods to refresh the UI. The method
    is thread-safe as it operates on player-specific data structures.
  warnings: Calling ClearMenus() without proper context may leave the player in an
    inconsistent menu state. Always ensure that menus are properly cleared before
    adding new options, especially when handling complex dialogue trees or multiple
    NPC interactions.
