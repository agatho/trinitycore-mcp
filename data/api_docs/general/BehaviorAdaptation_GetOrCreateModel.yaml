  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: GetOrCreateModel
  signature: BotLearningModel * BehaviorAdaptation::GetOrCreateModel(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or creates a bot learning model associated with the specified bot
    GUID.
  description: The GetOrCreateModel method is responsible for fetching an existing
    BotLearningModel instance associated with a given bot GUID, or creating a new
    one if it does not already exist. This method is typically used in the context
    of AI behavior adaptation within TrinityCore's bot system, where each bot maintains
    its own learning model to adapt its behavior based on interactions and experiences.
    The method ensures that a unique model exists per bot, enabling personalized learning
    and decision-making for individual bots. It may involve internal lookups or creation
    logic depending on the implementation details of the BehaviorAdaptation class.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve or
      create a learning model. This value must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing
      an existing bot in the system.
  returns: A pointer to the BotLearningModel associated with the specified bot GUID.
    If no such model exists, it creates and returns a new one. Returns nullptr if
    the input GUID is invalid or if allocation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nBotLearningModel* model = behaviorAdaptation->GetOrCreateModel(botGuid);\n\
      if (model)\n{\n    // Use the model for learning or behavior adaptation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nBotLearningModel* model\
      \ = behaviorAdaptation->GetOrCreateModel(botGuid);\nif (!model)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to retrieve or create learning model for bot %u\", botGuid);\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with using the model\nmodel->UpdateKnowledge();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment,
    but developers should verify that internal locking mechanisms are in place. The
    returned pointer should be treated as owned by the BehaviorAdaptation instance,
    and direct deletion of the model is discouraged unless explicitly supported by
    the API design.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter is valid before calling this method;
    invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or failed allocations. Also, be cautious
    about memory management when dealing with dynamically created models, especially
    in long-running systems.
