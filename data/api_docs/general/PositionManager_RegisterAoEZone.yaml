  signature: void PositionManager::RegisterAoEZone(const AoEZone & zone)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an Area of Effect (AoE) zone with the PositionManager for tracking
    and collision detection.
  description: The RegisterAoEZone method adds a new Area of Effect zone to the internal
    tracking system managed by the PositionManager. This allows the system to monitor
    and respond to units entering or leaving these zones, which is essential for implementing
    spell effects, trap triggers, and other game mechanics that affect multiple targets
    within a defined area. The method stores the AoEZone object internally, making
    it available for subsequent queries and updates. It's typically called when initializing
    or spawning AoE-based game objects such as fireballs, area spells, or environmental
    hazards.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: A constant reference to an AoEZone object that defines the spatial
      boundaries and properties of the area effect. This includes position, radius,
      type, and other relevant parameters for the zone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Zone Registration
    code: 'AoEZone zone;

      zone.SetPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      zone.SetRadius(10.0f);

      zone.SetType(AoEZone::Type::Fire);

      positionManager.RegisterAoEZone(zone);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Zones in a Spell Effect
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < spellTargets.size(); ++i)\n{\n    AoEZone zone;\n \
      \   zone.SetPosition(spellTargets[i].x, spellTargets[i].y, spellTargets[i].z);\n\
      \    zone.SetRadius(spellRadius);\n    zone.SetType(AoEZone::Type::Poison);\n\
      \    positionManager.RegisterAoEZone(zone);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PositionManager maintains a collection of active AoE zones, and this
    method adds to that collection. It's important to ensure that the AoEZone object
    passed in is fully initialized before calling this method. The internal storage
    may have limits on how many zones can be tracked simultaneously, depending on
    server configuration.
  warnings: Calling RegisterAoEZone with an invalid or uninitialized AoEZone object
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all required fields of the AoEZone
    are properly set before registration.
