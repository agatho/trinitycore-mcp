  class: Item
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 Item::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the item.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique script identifier that
    is assigned to an Item instance. This identifier is used by the TrinityCore core
    to determine which script or handler should be invoked when certain events occur
    related to the item, such as when it is picked up, sold, or used. The method is
    typically used in conjunction with other item-related functions to manage item
    behavior and interactions within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the script identifier assigned to the
    item. This value corresponds to the ScriptID field in the ItemTemplate table,
    which defines how the item behaves when specific actions are performed on it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nuint32 scriptId = item->GetScriptId();\n\
      if (scriptId != 0)\n{\n    // Do something with the script ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class and should be used carefully when dealing
    with item templates or scripts. It's important to understand that the returned
    value might not always correspond to a valid script entry, especially if the item
    was created without proper initialization.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other item-related
    functions, as improper handling may lead to incorrect script behavior or even
    crashes if the script ID is invalid or unassigned.
