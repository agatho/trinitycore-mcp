  signature: void GroupIntegration::UpdateGroupObjectives(Group * group, const RegularGroupScenario
    & scenario)
documentation:
  brief: Updates group objectives based on the provided scenario data.
  description: The UpdateGroupObjectives method is responsible for synchronizing and
    applying objective states within a group based on a given scenario. This method
    ensures that all group members' progress, rewards, and quest statuses are accurately
    reflected according to the specified scenario parameters. It typically handles
    updates related to group-based achievements, scenario-specific objectives, or
    dynamic content that affects multiple players simultaneously. The method operates
    on a Group object and uses a RegularGroupScenario structure to determine how objectives
    should be updated across all members of the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose objectives need to be updated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: scenario
    description: Reference to a RegularGroupScenario structure containing the objective
      data and rules for updating group members' progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);

      RegularGroupScenario scenario;

      // Populate scenario with objective data

      UpdateGroupObjectives(myGroup, scenario);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Scenario
    code: "if (myGroup && myGroup->IsInWorld()) {\n    RegularGroupScenario scenario;\n\
      \    scenario.objectiveType = GROUP_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_QUEST;\n    scenario.requiredProgress\
      \ = 100;\n    scenario.rewardId = 54321;\n    UpdateGroupObjectives(myGroup,\
      \ scenario);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group is valid and in a world
    context. It may trigger internal updates to player objectives and could affect
    quest progression or achievement tracking for all group members. The method does
    not perform any validation on the scenario data, so callers must ensure that the
    provided scenario is well-formed.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the group exists and is active before invoking this method.
    Improper use of scenario data may lead to inconsistent objective states across
    group members.
