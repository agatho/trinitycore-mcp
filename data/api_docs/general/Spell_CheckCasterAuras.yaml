documentation:
  brief: Checks caster auras for spell casting conditions
  description: This method evaluates the current caster's aura state to determine
    if the spell can be cast successfully. It examines various aura effects and states
    that may prevent or allow spell casting, including but not limited to negative
    effects, beneficial auras, and specific mechanical conditions. The method returns
    a SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can proceed with casting or if
    there are restrictions preventing it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult value indicating the outcome of the aura check.
    Possible values include SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS, SPELL_FAILED_CasterAuraState, SPELL_FAILED_InvalidTargets,
    and others depending on the specific aura conditions encountered during the evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckCasterAuras();\nif (result == SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS)\n\
      {\n    // Spell can be cast\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Spell cannot be cast, handle\
      \ accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore system to validate
    spell casting conditions before execution. It may involve complex aura state checks
    and should not be called directly in most cases unless specifically required for
    custom spell logic.
  warnings: This method does not handle any specific error conditions or exceptions;
    it simply returns a SpellCastResult based on the current caster's aura state.
    Care must be taken when implementing custom logic around this method to avoid
    incorrect spell casting behavior.
