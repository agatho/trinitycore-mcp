documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to sort inventory bags in the player's backpack
  description: The HandleSortBags method processes a packet from the client indicating
    that the player wants to sort their inventory bags. This function is part of the
    WorldSession class and is responsible for reorganizing items within the player's
    bag slots according to the game's sorting rules. It typically handles the logic
    for rearranging items to optimize space usage or maintain a specific order, such
    as grouping similar items together or organizing by item type. The method does
    not directly modify the database but updates the in-memory item state and sends
    appropriate updates back to the client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within WorldSession
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSortBags(WorldPackets::Item::SortBags& sortBags)\n\
      {\n    // Process the sorting request\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n \
      \   if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    // Perform bag sorting logic\n\
      \    player->GetBagSorting();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player clicks the 'Sort Bags' button
    in the game interface. The actual sorting algorithm may vary based on client settings
    or server configurations. It's important to note that this method only affects
    the in-memory representation of items and does not persist changes to the database
    until the next save cycle.
