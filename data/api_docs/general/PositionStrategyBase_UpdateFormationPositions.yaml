api:
  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: UpdateFormationPositions
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::UpdateFormationPositions(int bots, Unit *
    centerTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positions of units in a formation around a central target.
  description: The UpdateFormationPositions method recalculates and applies new positions
    for units participating in a formation, using the specified center target as the
    reference point. This method is typically used in AI systems to maintain coordinated
    group movement or positioning, such as when a group of bots or NPCs needs to reposition
    themselves around a leader or objective. It handles the logic for distributing
    units in a strategic pattern based on their current state and the formation configuration.
    The method ensures that all participating units adjust their locations dynamically
    to maintain formation integrity while respecting movement constraints and avoiding
    collisions.
  parameters:
  - name: bots
    description: The number of bot or NPC units involved in the formation that will
      have their positions updated.
  - name: centerTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the central reference point
      for the formation. All other units will position themselves relative to this
      target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      Unit* center = player->GetVictim();

      strategy.UpdateFormationPositions(5, center);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Formation
    code: "PositionStrategyBase strategy;\nUnit* center = nullptr;\nif (group && !group->GetMembers().empty())\
      \ {\n    center = group->GetMembers().front()->GetUnit();\n}\nstrategy.UpdateFormationPositions(group\
      \ ? group->GetMembers().size() : 0, center);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the formation configuration has already been set
    up and that units are properly initialized. It does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters, so callers should ensure that 'bots' is a non-negative
    integer and 'centerTarget' is a valid pointer to an existing Unit object.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the formation or
    with invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior or incorrect positioning.
    Ensure that all units involved in the formation are in a valid state before calling
    this function.
