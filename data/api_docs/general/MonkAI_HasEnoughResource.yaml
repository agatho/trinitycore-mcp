api:
  class: MonkAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool MonkAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Monk AI has sufficient resource requirements to cast a specified
    spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the current Monk AI
    instance possesses adequate resources (such as Chi, Energy, or other class-specific
    currencies) to execute a given spell. This method is typically used within the
    AI's decision-making process to determine spell eligibility before attempting
    to cast. It considers the spell's resource cost and compares it against the AI's
    current resource pool. The method returns true if sufficient resources are available;
    otherwise, it returns false. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    gameplay balance and ensuring that spells are only cast when feasible.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to a specific spell in the game's database, defining
      its resource cost and other properties.
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the AI has enough resources to cast
    the specified spell. Returns true if sufficient resources are available, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (monkAI->HasEnoughResource(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with casting the\
      \ spell\n    monkAI->CastSpell(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle insufficient\
      \ resources\n    monkAI->SelectNextSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Decision Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (HasEnoughResource(13763)) {\n      \
      \  CastSpell(13763); // Tiger Palm\n    } else if (HasEnoughResource(100780))\
      \ {\n        CastSpell(100780); // Blackout Kick\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal resource tracking system and assumes
    that resource updates occur regularly. It does not account for temporary buffs
    or debuffs that might affect resource costs. Developers should ensure that this
    method is called within a context where the AI's resource state is valid.
  warnings: Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to
    actual spells in the database, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors during resource evaluation.
