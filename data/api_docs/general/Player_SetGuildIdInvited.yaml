api:
  class: Player
  method: SetGuildIdInvited
  signature: void Player::SetGuildIdInvited(int GuildId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the guild ID that the player has been invited to.
  description: This method assigns a specific guild ID to the player, indicating that
    they have been invited to join that guild. The method is typically used during
    the guild invitation process and affects the player's internal state regarding
    guild membership. It does not actually join the player to the guild; instead,
    it sets the invitation status which can be checked later using GetGuildIdInvited().
    This method is part of the game mechanics that manage player guild invitations
    and is essential for handling guild-related communications in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: GuildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild the player has been invited to.
      This value represents the guild's ID in the database, typically used for tracking
      which guild a player has been invited to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild Invitation
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGuildIdInvited(12345);

      // Player now has guild ID 12345 set as their invited guild'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other guild-related methods
    to manage player invitations. It should be called when a player receives a guild
    invitation, and the value should be cleared or reset when the player accepts or
    declines the invitation.
  warnings: This method does not actually join the player to the guild; it only sets
    the invitation status. If used incorrectly, it may lead to confusion in guild
    management and player state tracking.
