documentation:
  brief: Initializes the ArenaAI behavior for an arena participant, setting up combat
    routines and AI states.
  description: The Initialize method configures the ArenaAI system for a player or
    creature participating in an arena match. It sets up essential AI parameters such
    as target selection logic, spell casting behavior, movement patterns, and combat
    strategies specific to arena environments. This method is typically called during
    the arena match start sequence to prepare the AI for competitive gameplay. The
    initialization process ensures that the entity adheres to arena rules, including
    proper targeting of opponents, avoidance of friendly fire, and execution of arena-specific
    abilities.

  - title: Basic ArenaAI Initialization
    code: 'ArenaAI* ai = new ArenaAI();

      ai->Initialize();

      // AI is now ready for arena combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on entities that are actually participating
    in an arena match. It assumes the entity has been properly registered with the
    arena system and has valid arena-related data structures initialized.
  warnings: Calling Initialize on a non-arena participant may cause undefined behavior
    or AI malfunctions. Ensure the entity is confirmed to be in an arena environment
    before calling this method.
