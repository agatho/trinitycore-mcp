documentation:
  brief: Populates a PlayerLevelInfo structure with statistics and data for a specified
    player race, class, and level.
  description: The BuildPlayerLevelInfo method is responsible for filling a PlayerLevelInfo
    structure with the appropriate statistics and data that correspond to a given
    player's race, class, and level. This method is typically used during character
    creation or when updating a player's information as they advance in levels. It
    retrieves pre-defined data from internal lookup tables or databases that store
    level-specific bonuses, health, mana, and other game mechanics relevant to each
    race-class combination. The method ensures that players have consistent and balanced
    stats based on their chosen class and progression through the game's leveling
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the player (e.g., Human, Orc, Night Elf). Must
      be a valid race ID defined in the game's constants.
  - name: class_
    description: The class type of the player (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue). Must be
      a valid class ID defined in the game's constants.
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the player. Should be within the valid range
      of player levels (typically 1-80 in most expansions).
  - name: plinfo
    description: Pointer to a PlayerLevelInfo structure that will be populated with
      level-specific data for the given race, class, and level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Populate player info for a level 1 Human Warrior
    code: 'PlayerLevelInfo levelInfo;

      ObjectMgr::Instance()->BuildPlayerLevelInfo(RACE_HUMAN, CLASS_WARRIOR, 1, &levelInfo);

      // levelInfo now contains the base stats for a level 1 Human Warrior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update player info when leveling up to 10
    code: 'PlayerLevelInfo levelInfo;

      ObjectMgr::Instance()->BuildPlayerLevelInfo(player->getRace(), player->getClass(),
      10, &levelInfo);

      // Update player''s stats based on new level 10 data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data tables that define how each race-class
    combination should behave at different levels. It is important to ensure that
    the provided parameters are valid, as invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect stat calculations. The method does not perform any validation on
    the input parameters beyond basic type checking.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to plinfo; doing so will result in a crash.
    Ensure that race and class values are valid identifiers from the game's constants,
    otherwise the resulting data may be corrupted or incomplete.
