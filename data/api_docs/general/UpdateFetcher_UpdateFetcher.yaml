  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: UpdateFetcher
  signature: void UpdateFetcher::UpdateFetcher(const Path & updateDirectory, const
    std::function<void (const std::string &)> & apply, const std::function<void (const
    Path &)> & applyFile, const int & retrieve)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an UpdateFetcher instance with directory path, apply function,
    file apply function, and retrieve count.
  description: The UpdateFetcher constructor initializes a new instance of the UpdateFetcher
    class. It sets up internal state with the provided update directory path, a function
    to apply updates, a function to process individual files, and a retrieval count.
    This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework for managing game data updates, such as patch files or configuration
    changes. The constructor prepares the fetcher to handle update operations based
    on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: updateDirectory
    description: The path to the directory containing update files or resources to
      be processed
  - name: apply
    description: A std::function that takes a std::string parameter representing an
      update identifier or name and applies the update logic
  - name: applyFile
    description: A std::function that takes a Path parameter representing a file path
      and processes individual files during the update operation
  - name: retrieve
    description: An integer value specifying how many updates or files to retrieve
      during the update process
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateFetcher Initialization
    code: "UpdateFetcher fetcher(\"/path/to/updates\", \n    [](const std::string&\
      \ updateId) { \n        // Apply update logic here\n        std::cout << \"\
      Applying update: \" << updateId << std::endl;\n    },\n    [](const Path& filePath)\
      \ {\n        // Process individual file\n        std::cout << \"Processing file:\
      \ \" << filePath.string() << std::endl;\n    },\n    5);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during system initialization or when
    setting up update mechanisms. The apply and applyFile functions are expected to
    be thread-safe if the update process runs concurrently. The retrieve parameter
    controls how many items are fetched in a single operation, affecting memory usage
    and performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the updateDirectory path exists and is accessible before calling
    this constructor. Improperly configured apply or applyFile functions may cause
    runtime errors during update processing.
