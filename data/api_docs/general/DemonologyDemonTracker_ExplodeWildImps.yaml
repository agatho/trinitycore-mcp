documentation:
  brief: Causes all wild imps summoned by the demonology warlock to explode simultaneously,
    dealing damage to nearby enemies.
  description: The ExplodeWildImps method is responsible for triggering the explosion
    effect of all currently active wild imps summoned by a demonology warlock. This
    method iterates through the list of summoned wild imps and applies an explosion
    spell or damage effect to each one. The explosion typically deals AoE (area of
    effect) damage to enemies within a certain radius around each imp's position.
    This functionality is commonly used when the warlock's pet summoning abilities
    are depleted, or as part of a specific talent or ability that causes wild imps
    to detonate. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return
    value operations; it solely manages the explosion behavior of the summoned creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Demonology Warlock AI
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockAI::OnDeath()\n{\n    // When the warlock dies, explode\
      \ all wild imps\n    m_demonTracker->ExplodeWildImps();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all wild imps are still valid and exist in the world
    before being exploded. It may be called during combat or non-combat situations,
    but its primary use case is during critical moments such as death or ability activation.
    The explosion effect should be consistent with the game's damage calculation system
    and respect any existing cooldowns or restrictions.
  warnings: Ensure that all wild imp references are properly managed to prevent memory
    leaks or invalid access. Calling this method when no wild imps exist may result
    in no-op behavior, but it is still recommended to check for active imps before
    invoking the method if performance is critical.
