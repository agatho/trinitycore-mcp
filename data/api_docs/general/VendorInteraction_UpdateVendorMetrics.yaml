    vendorGuid, uint32 transactionValue, bool wasPurchase)
documentation:
  brief: Updates vendor interaction metrics for a player's transaction with a vendor.
  description: The UpdateVendorMetrics method records and updates performance or behavioral
    metrics related to a player's interaction with a vendor in the World of Warcraft
    environment. This function is typically invoked when a player completes a purchase
    or sale through a vendor, logging data such as transaction value, type of interaction
    (purchase vs. sale), and associated GUIDs for both player and vendor. It plays
    a role in tracking trading behavior, potential abuse detection, and maintaining
    game economy integrity within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player involved in the vendor
      transaction.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor with whom the player interacted.
  - name: transactionValue
    description: The monetary value of the transaction, typically represented in copper
      units.
  - name: wasPurchase
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the transaction was a purchase
      (true) or a sale (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Purchase Metrics Update
    code: VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorMetrics(12345, 67890, 5000, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Vendor Sale Metrics Update
    code: VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorMetrics(12345, 67890, 3000, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal logging or database systems to
    store vendor transaction data. It may be used in conjunction with other vendor-related
    functions such as item availability checks or economy balance calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid and vendorGuid are valid before calling this function,
    as invalid GUIDs could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior in the metrics
    system.
