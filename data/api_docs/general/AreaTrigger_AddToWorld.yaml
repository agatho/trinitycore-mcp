  method: AddToWorld
  signature: void AreaTrigger::AddToWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the area trigger to the world environment, making it active and visible
    to players in its associated map.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates an AreaTrigger object into the game
    world's active systems. This method ensures that the area trigger is properly
    registered with the map manager and becomes functional for detecting player presence
    or triggering events. It typically initializes internal state, registers the trigger
    with the appropriate map instance, and prepares it to respond to player interactions.
    The method should only be called after all necessary initialization of the area
    trigger's properties has been completed. Once added to the world, the area trigger
    will begin participating in the game loop and can activate based on player movement
    or other conditions defined by its implementation.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      // Initialize trigger properties...

      trigger->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Map Registration
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      trigger->SetMap(map);

      trigger->SetPosition(x, y, z);

      trigger->SetRadius(radius);

      trigger->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly on area triggers that are already
    in the world. It is typically invoked automatically during object creation or
    when transitioning an area trigger from an inactive to active state. The method
    performs necessary setup operations including map registration and spatial indexing,
    which are crucial for performance.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld multiple times on the same area trigger instance may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory issues. Always ensure that the area trigger
    has been properly initialized with valid map, position, and radius data before
    calling this method. Avoid calling this method from within a player movement handler
    as it could cause recursion or thread safety issues.
