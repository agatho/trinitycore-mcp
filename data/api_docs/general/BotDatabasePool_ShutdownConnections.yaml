documentation:
  brief: Closes all active database connections in the bot database connection pool.
  description: The ShutdownConnections method terminates all currently active database
    connections within the BotDatabasePool. This method is typically invoked during
    system shutdown or when reconnecting to a different database instance. It ensures
    that all resources associated with the database connections are properly released
    and that no stale connections remain open. The method does not return any value
    and should be called before the pool object is destroyed to prevent resource leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().ShutdownConnections();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server shutdown sequences. It's important to ensure that no database operations
    are in progress when this method is invoked, as it may lead to undefined behavior
    or data corruption.
