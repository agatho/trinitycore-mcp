documentation:
  brief: Sets an error message for the playerbot database connection
  description: The SetError method assigns an error message to the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
    object, typically used to track database operation failures or communication issues.
    This method is part of the database connection error handling mechanism in TrinityCore's
    playerbot system. The error message is stored internally and can be retrieved
    later for debugging or logging purposes. This method does not throw exceptions
    but simply records the error state of the connection.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the error message to be set for this database
      connection. Should describe the nature of the database error that occurred.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an error message after failed database query
    code: 'PlayerbotDatabaseConnection* dbConn = new PlayerbotDatabaseConnection();

      dbConn->SetError("Failed to execute SELECT query on playerbots table");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetError in error handling context
    code: "try {\n    // Database operation\n    if (!dbConnection->ExecuteQuery(\"\
      SELECT * FROM playerbots\")) {\n        dbConnection->SetError(\"Database query\
      \ failed: \" + dbConnection->GetLastError());\n    }\n} catch (const std::exception&\
      \ e) {\n    dbConnection->SetError(\"Exception occurred: \" + std::string(e.what()));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the playerbot system when database
    operations fail. The error message can be accessed through other methods like
    GetError() or GetLastError(). This method does not perform any automatic error
    recovery or retry logic.
  warnings: Calling SetError multiple times will overwrite the previous error message.
    Ensure that error messages are descriptive enough to aid debugging, but avoid
    including sensitive information in the error strings.
