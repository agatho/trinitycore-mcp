documentation:
  brief: Compares two IdleMovementParams objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison between
    this IdleMovementParams object and another IdleMovementParams object. It returns
    true if all corresponding members of both objects are equal, and false otherwise.
    This comparison is typically used to determine whether two idle movement parameters
    represent the same configuration, which can be important for avoiding redundant
    AI behavior calculations or identifying when movement parameters have changed.
    The method does not consider any dynamic state or runtime conditions; it only
    compares static member values.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The IdleMovementParams object to compare against this instance.
  returns: True if all members of both IdleMovementParams objects are equal, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'IdleMovementParams params1;

      IdleMovementParams params2;

      bool isEqual = (params1 == params2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      member values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (idleMovementParams == anotherIdleMovementParams) {\n    // Perform\
      \ some action when movement parameters are the same\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"\
      Idle movement parameters unchanged\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using member-wise comparison of all relevant
    fields in the IdleMovementParams structure. It's important to note that if the
    class contains pointers or complex objects, the default implementation may perform
    shallow comparisons unless explicitly overridden.
