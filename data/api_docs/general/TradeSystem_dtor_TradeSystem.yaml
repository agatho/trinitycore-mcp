documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TradeSystem instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~TradeSystem destructor is automatically invoked when a TradeSystem
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and references
    related to the trade system functionality. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor may handle cleanup of trade-related state
    information, such as pending trades, transaction records, or associated player
    references. The destructor is typically called by the runtime environment and
    should not be invoked manually unless explicitly managing object lifecycle through
    custom memory allocation.

  - title: Automatic destruction of TradeSystem instance
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    TradeSystem* tradeSystem = new TradeSystem();\n\
      \    // ... perform trade operations ...\n    delete tradeSystem; // Triggers\
      \ ~TradeSystem destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, trade systems are typically
    managed through the game's core systems and may involve additional cleanup in
    related subsystems.
