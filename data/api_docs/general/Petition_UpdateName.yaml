  class: Petition
  method: UpdateName
  signature: void Petition::UpdateName(const std::string & newName)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the name of a petition with the provided new name value.
  description: The UpdateName method is used to modify the name field of a Petition
    object. This method takes a new name as input and updates the internal state of
    the petition accordingly. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, petitions
    are typically used for guild creation or other in-game actions that require a
    name. The method likely performs validation on the input name to ensure it meets
    game requirements such as length limits or character restrictions. This update
    operation is generally expected to persist changes to the database or in-memory
    representation of the petition.
  parameters:
  - name: newName
    description: The new name to assign to the petition. Must be a valid string that
      adheres to game naming conventions, including length and character restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating a Petition Name
    code: "Petition* petition = sObjectMgr->GetPetitionById(12345);\nif (petition)\n\
      {\n    petition->UpdateName(\"NewGuildName\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal validation and may update the database
    record associated with the petition. It is assumed that this operation is thread-safe
    within the context of TrinityCore's architecture, but direct usage in multithreaded
    environments should be verified.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided name meets all game restrictions before calling
    this method to avoid potential errors or invalid data states. Improperly formatted
    names may cause silent failures or database inconsistencies.
