  method: IsEmpty
  signature: bool PersonalPhaseSpawns::IsEmpty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the personal phase spawns container is empty.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if the PersonalPhaseSpawns container
    holds no entries. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to verify
    if a player's personal phase has any associated spawns before performing operations
    on them. The method performs a simple size check on the internal data structure
    and returns true if no spawns are present, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for managing dynamic spawn systems within personal phases, such as
    those used in dungeons or raid encounters where certain entities may only appear
    under specific conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the PersonalPhaseSpawns container contains no entries,
    false if it contains one or more spawns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if personal phase has spawns
    code: "if (player->GetPersonalPhaseSpawns()->IsEmpty())\n{\n    // No spawns in\
      \ this personal phase\n    // Perform alternative logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty to conditionally process spawns
    code: "auto phaseSpawns = player->GetPersonalPhaseSpawns();\nif (!phaseSpawns->IsEmpty())\n\
      {\n    // Process existing spawns\n    for (auto& spawn : phaseSpawns->GetSpawns())\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle individual spawn\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No spawns\
      \ to process, perhaps log or notify\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically O(1) complexity as it relies on checking the size
    of an internal container. It's safe to call from any thread context where the
    PersonalPhaseSpawns object is accessible and not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the PersonalPhaseSpawns object is valid before calling this
    method, as calling IsEmpty on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that concurrent modification of the spawns container during this
    check may lead to inconsistent results if not properly synchronized.
