  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: CanSpawnMore
  signature: bool LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::CanSpawnMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional bots can be spawned by the spawner adapter
  description: The CanSpawnMore method evaluates the current state of the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
    to determine if it is permissible to spawn more bot characters. This check typically
    considers factors such as maximum spawn limits, available resources, and system
    constraints. The method returns true if spawning is allowed, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for managing bot population in World of Warcraft
    environments where bot usage must be controlled to maintain server performance
    and game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether more bots can be spawned. Returns true
    if spawning is permitted; returns false if spawning is not allowed due to limits
    or constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawner->CanSpawnMore()) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning logic\n\
      \    spawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no more bots can\
      \ be spawned\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Cannot spawn more bots at this time.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other spawner logic to ensure
    that bot populations remain within configured limits. It may interact with configuration
    settings or runtime constraints that govern how many bots can exist simultaneously.
