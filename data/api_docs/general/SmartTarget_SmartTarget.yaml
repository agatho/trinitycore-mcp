  signature: void SmartTarget::SmartTarget(SMARTAI_TARGETS t, uint32 p1, uint32 p2,
    uint32 p3, uint32 p4)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or updates the smart AI target with specified parameters for
    creature behavior.
  description: The SmartTarget method is used within TrinityCore's SmartAI system
    to define and configure targeting behavior for creatures. It accepts a target
    type and associated parameters that determine how the creature will select its
    target during AI execution. This method integrates with the broader SmartAI framework
    to control mob aggression, spell casting, and movement based on environmental
    triggers or conditions. The implementation likely involves internal state management
    to track target selection criteria and update target references accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: Target type identifier from SMARTAI_TARGETS enumeration defining
      the targeting logic to apply
  - name: p1
    description: Primary parameter for target selection, meaning varies based on target
      type (e.g., distance, health percentage, etc.)
  - name: p2
    description: Secondary parameter for target selection, often used for additional
      filtering or condition values
  - name: p3
    description: Tertiary parameter for target selection, typically used for complex
      targeting rules or thresholds
  - name: p4
    description: Quaternary parameter for target selection, may be used for advanced
      targeting modifiers or flags
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Selection
    code: SmartTarget(SMARTAI_TARGET_PLAYER, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Within Distance
    code: SmartTarget(SMARTAI_TARGET_NEAREST_PLAYER, 50, 0, 0, 0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI system and should only be called from
    within AI context. The parameters are interpreted based on the target type enumeration
    values which define specific targeting behaviors in TrinityCore's AI engine.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values or invalid target types may cause undefined
    behavior or AI malfunction. Ensure proper initialization before calling this method
    in active AI contexts.
