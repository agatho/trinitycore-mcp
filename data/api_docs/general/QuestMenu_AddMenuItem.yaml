  method: AddMenuItem
  signature: void QuestMenu::AddMenuItem(uint32 QuestId, uint8 Icon)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a quest menu item to the player's quest menu with specified quest ID
    and icon.
  description: The AddMenuItem method is used to add a new quest entry to the player's
    quest menu interface. This method allows the game to dynamically populate the
    quest list that players see when interacting with quest givers. The method takes
    a quest identifier and an icon type, which determines how the quest appears in
    the player's quest log or quest giver dialog. The icon parameter typically corresponds
    to predefined UI icons used by the game client to visually distinguish different
    types of quests (e.g., normal, heroic, daily). This method is commonly called
    during quest initialization or when a player gains access to new quests through
    various game mechanics such as quest gating or quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: QuestId
    description: The unique identifier for the quest to be added to the menu. This
      ID must correspond to a valid quest in the database and is used to retrieve
      quest data when the player interacts with the menu item.
  - name: Icon
    description: The icon type to display for this quest entry in the menu. This value
      determines the visual representation of the quest in the UI, typically mapping
      to predefined icon constants used by the game client (e.g., 0 = normal quest,
      1 = critical quest, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Menu Item Addition
    code: "void AddPlayerQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    QuestMenu&\
      \ questMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu()->GetQuestMenu();\n    questMenu.AddMenuItem(questId,\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Quest Menu Items
    code: "void SetupQuestMenu(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestMenu& questMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu()->GetQuestMenu();\n\
      \    questMenu.AddMenuItem(12345, 0);\n    questMenu.AddMenuItem(12346, 1);\n\
      \    questMenu.AddMenuItem(12347, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal quest menu state of a player. It is typically
    called during quest initialization or when a player gains access to new quests.
    The method does not validate whether the QuestId exists in the database; it simply
    adds the item to the menu. If a quest ID is invalid, the client may display an
    empty or broken entry.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the QuestId can result
    in missing or broken quest entries in the player's menu. Ensure that all QuestIds
    passed are valid and exist in the game database before calling this method.
