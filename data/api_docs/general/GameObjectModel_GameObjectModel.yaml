  brief: Initializes a new GameObjectModel instance with default values and prepares
    it for use in the game world.
  description: The GameObjectModel constructor initializes a new instance of the GameObjectModel
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the model, including initializing
    member variables to their default values and preparing the object for integration
    into the TrinityCore game world system. The constructor ensures that all necessary
    data structures are properly allocated and configured before the model can be
    used for collision detection, rendering, or other game mechanics involving interactive
    objects. This initialization is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game's
    physics and object interaction systems.

  - title: Creating a new GameObjectModel instance
    code: 'GameObjectModel* model = new GameObjectModel();

      // The model is now initialized and ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new GameObjectModel
    object. It performs essential initialization that must occur before any other
    methods are invoked on the instance. The constructor does not take any parameters,
    so all configuration must be done through subsequent method calls or member variable
    assignments.
