  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::UnregisterBot(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from the interrupt coordinator's tracking system by its unique
    identifier.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the InterruptCoordinatorFixed's
    internal tracking mechanism. This function is typically used when a bot is no
    longer active or needs to be disconnected from the interrupt coordination system.
    The method takes the bot's unique identifier (GUID) as input and performs cleanup
    operations to ensure that the bot is properly removed from any active interrupt
    queues or state tracking. It is important to note that this method should only
    be called with valid bot GUIDs to avoid undefined behavior or system inconsistencies.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered from the
      interrupt coordinator system. This value must correspond to a valid bot that
      was previously registered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnregisterBot Usage
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed* coordinator = sWorld->GetInterruptCoordinator();

      coordinator->UnregisterBot(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system within TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It may involve internal data structure modifications such as removing
    entries from hash maps or lists that track active bots.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a registered
    bot before calling this function.
