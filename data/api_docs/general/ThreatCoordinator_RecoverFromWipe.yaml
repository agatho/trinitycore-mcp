documentation:
  brief: Restores threat levels and resets the threat coordinator state after a wipe
    event.
  description: The RecoverFromWipe method is used to reset and restore the threat
    coordination state following a group wipe in World of Warcraft. This function
    ensures that all mobs' threat tables are properly cleared and reinitialized, allowing
    for a fresh encounter start. It typically gets invoked when a raid or dungeon
    encounter ends in failure, ensuring that no residual threat data persists into
    the next attempt. The method handles cleanup of internal threat tracking structures
    and resets relevant flags to prepare for new combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage after a wipe
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->RecoverFromWipe();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core combat system upon
    detecting a group wipe. Developers should not need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom encounter logic or testing scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper wipe detection may lead to inconsistent
    threat states and unexpected mob behavior during encounters.
