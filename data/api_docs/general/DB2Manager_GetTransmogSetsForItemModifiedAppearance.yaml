  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetTransmogSetsForItemModifiedAppearance(uint32
    itemModifiedAppearanceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of transmog sets associated with a given item modified
    appearance ID.
  description: This method fetches the set of transmogrification sets that are linked
    to a specific item modified appearance identifier. It is used primarily in the
    context of World of Warcraft's transmogrification system, where players can change
    the visual appearance of their gear without altering its stats. The returned array
    contains identifiers for transmog sets, which define which items can be used to
    transmogrify others. This method does not perform any validation on the input
    ID and assumes it refers to a valid item modified appearance entry in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an array of integers representing the IDs of transmog sets
    associated with the specified item modified appearance ID. The array is null-terminated,
    and may be nullptr if no transmog sets are found for the given ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Transmog Sets for Item Modified Appearance
    code: "const int* transmogSets = sDB2Manager->GetTransmogSetsForItemModifiedAppearance(12345);\n\
      if (transmogSets != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; transmogSets[i] != 0; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Transmog Set ID: %d\\n\", transmogSets[i]);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the DB2Manager and should not
    be freed or modified by the caller. The method relies on preloaded DB2 data files,
    so it will only return valid results if the corresponding data has been loaded
    into memory.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemModifiedAppearanceId parameter corresponds to a valid
    entry in the ItemModifiedAppearance.db2 file; otherwise, the result may be empty
    or invalid. The returned pointer is only valid until the next call to this method
    or until the DB2Manager instance is destroyed.
