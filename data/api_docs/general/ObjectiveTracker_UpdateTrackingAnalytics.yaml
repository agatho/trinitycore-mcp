  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: UpdateTrackingAnalytics
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateTrackingAnalytics(uint32 botGuid, const
    ObjectiveState & state, bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates tracking analytics for a bot's objective state and success status.
  description: The UpdateTrackingAnalytics method records and processes analytics
    data related to a bot's progress in completing objectives within the World of
    Warcraft environment. This method is typically invoked when a bot has completed
    or failed an objective, allowing the system to track performance metrics and update
    internal tracking structures accordingly. It integrates with the broader ObjectiveTracker
    subsystem to maintain accurate statistics on bot behavior and mission success
    rates.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which analytics are being
      updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: state
    description: The current state of the objective being tracked. This parameter
      defines what stage or condition the bot has reached in relation to the objective.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the bot's attempt to complete the
      objective was successful. True indicates success, false indicates failure or
      abandonment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      ObjectiveState state = ObjectiveState::IN_PROGRESS;

      tracker->UpdateTrackingAnalytics(12345, state, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Failure Scenario
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      ObjectiveState state = ObjectiveState::FAILED;

      tracker->UpdateTrackingAnalytics(12345, state, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal analytics system used by TrinityCore's
    bot framework. It assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid bot entity
    and that the ObjectiveState is one of the predefined states in the system. The
    method does not directly interact with the game client but updates server-side
    tracking data.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to an actual existing bot, as
    invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or errors during analytics processing.
    Also, verify that the ObjectiveState passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this function.
