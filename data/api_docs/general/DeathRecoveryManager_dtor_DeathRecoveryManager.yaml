documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DeathRecoveryManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~DeathRecoveryManager destructor is called when a DeathRecoveryManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any allocated memory, registered callbacks, or internal data structures
    used by the death recovery system. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this manager likely handles logic related to character resurrection,
    corpse management, and death-related mechanics. The destructor does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations, as it is a cleanup function.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DeathRecoveryManager
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    DeathRecoveryManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    an object goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually call
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The DeathRecoveryManager
    likely manages internal state related to player death events and resurrection
    timers.
