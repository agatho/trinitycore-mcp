  signature: void DungeonBehavior::RecoverFromWipe(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Restores dungeon instance state after a group wipe event.
  description: The RecoverFromWipe method handles the recovery process for a dungeon
    instance when a group has wiped during combat. This method is responsible for
    resetting the dungeon's state, potentially adjusting difficulty settings, and
    preparing the group for a retry or alternative outcome. It typically manages cooldowns,
    resets mob spawns, and ensures that the dungeon environment is properly restored
    to its pre-wipe condition. The method may also handle logging and notification
    systems to inform players of the wipe recovery status.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that experienced
      the wipe. This parameter is required and must point to a valid group instance
      within the dungeon context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter logic
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnPlayerWipe(Group* group)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.RecoverFromWipe(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with additional cleanup before recovery
    code: "void DungeonManager::HandleGroupWipe(Group* group)\n{\n    // Perform any\
      \ necessary cleanup\n    CleanupDeadCreatures(group);\n    \n    // Recover\
      \ dungeon state\n    dungeonBehavior.RecoverFromWipe(group);\n    \n    // Notify\
      \ players of recovery\n    SendRecoveryMessage(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core dungeon management
    system when a group wipe occurs. Developers should ensure that all associated
    creatures, GameObjects, and quest states are properly reset before calling this
    method. The method may also trigger internal state transitions that affect the
    overall dungeon progression.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is still active and within the dungeon
    instance before invoking this recovery mechanism. Additionally, avoid calling
    this method multiple times on the same group during a single wipe event as it
    may cause inconsistent state management.
