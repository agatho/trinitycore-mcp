documentation:
  brief: Clears all role-based access control data from the RBACData object.
  description: The ClearData method resets the internal state of the RBACData object
    by removing all associated role-based access control permissions, privileges,
    and assignments. This method is typically used when reinitializing or resetting
    user permissions within the TrinityCore authentication and authorization system.
    The operation effectively nullifies any previously set RBAC rules for the associated
    account or entity, ensuring a clean slate for new permission configurations. No
    parameters are required as the method operates on the instance's internal data
    exclusively.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Reset Permissions
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      // ... assign some permissions ...

      rbacData.ClearData(); // Reset all RBAC data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it permanently removes all RBAC information
    without the possibility of recovery unless backed up. It is commonly invoked during
    account login resets, permission updates, or when transitioning between different
    authentication states in TrinityCore.
