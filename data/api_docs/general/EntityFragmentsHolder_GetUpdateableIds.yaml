documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a span of updateable entity fragments managed by this holder.
  description: The GetUpdateableIds method returns a std::span<const EntityFragment>
    that provides read-only access to the collection of entity fragments that are
    marked as updateable within the EntityFragmentsHolder. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to efficiently iterate
    over and process entities that require periodic updates, such as player movements,
    NPC states, or object transformations. The returned span ensures safe access to
    the underlying data without allowing modifications through this interface. The
    method does not perform any side effects and is purely a getter operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::span<const EntityFragment> representing a view into the collection
    of updateable entity fragments. This span provides read-only access to the elements,
    ensuring that the underlying data cannot be modified through this interface. The
    span's lifetime is tied to the EntityFragmentsHolder instance and becomes invalid
    if the holder is modified or destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Over Updateable Fragments
    code: "const auto updateableIds = entityFragmentsHolder.GetUpdateableIds();\n\
      for (const auto& fragment : updateableIds)\n{\n    // Process each updateable\
      \ entity fragment\n    std::cout << \"Fragment ID: \" << fragment.GetId() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Empty Updateable Fragments
    code: "const auto updateableIds = entityFragmentsHolder.GetUpdateableIds();\n\
      if (updateableIds.empty())\n{\n    // No updateable fragments found\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No updateable entities present.\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the updateable fragments\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << updateableIds.size()\
      \ << \" updateable fragments.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned std::span is a view into the internal storage of the EntityFragmentsHolder.
    It's important to note that modifications to the holder (e.g., adding or removing
    fragments) may invalidate the span if the underlying container is reallocated.
    This method is optimized for performance and avoids unnecessary copying of data.
    The const correctness ensures that the returned span cannot be used to modify
    the contained elements.
  warnings: Do not assume the lifetime of the returned span extends beyond the lifetime
    of the EntityFragmentsHolder instance. If the holder's contents are modified,
    the span may become invalid. Additionally, since this is a read-only view, attempting
    to modify elements through the span will result in compilation errors.
