  method: StartInteraction
  signature: void InteractionData::StartInteraction(int target, PlayerInteractionType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a player interaction with a specified target and interaction type.
  description: The StartInteraction method begins a player interaction process by
    associating a target entity with a specific interaction type. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to manage player-driven actions such as
    quest interactions, vendor transactions, or object usage. The method sets up the
    necessary state for the interaction and prepares the player's interaction context.
    It does not perform the actual interaction logic itself but rather initializes
    the interaction framework that other systems can then utilize.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The identifier of the target entity with which the player is interacting.
      This could be a GameObject GUID, Creature GUID, or Item GUID depending on the
      interaction type.
  - name: type
    description: The PlayerInteractionType enum value that defines what kind of interaction
      is being initiated. Common types include QUEST_INTERACTION, VENDOR_INTERACTION,
      and OBJECT_INTERACTION.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Interaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      GameObject* questGiver = ...;

      player->GetPlayerInteractionData()->StartInteraction(questGiver->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),
      PlayerInteractionType::QUEST_INTERACTION);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Vendor Interaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Creature* vendor = ...;

      player->GetPlayerInteractionData()->StartInteraction(vendor->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),
      PlayerInteractionType::VENDOR_INTERACTION);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is within interaction range
    of the target. The actual interaction handling logic typically occurs in subsequent
    calls to other methods like UpdateInteraction or HandleInteraction. This method
    does not validate whether the target is valid or accessible; that responsibility
    lies with calling code.
  warnings: Calling StartInteraction without proper validation may lead to undefined
    behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that the target GUID is valid and the player
    has line of sight to the target before initiating the interaction. Avoid calling
    this method multiple times consecutively without completing previous interactions.
