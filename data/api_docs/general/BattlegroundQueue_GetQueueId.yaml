  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: GetQueueId
  signature: int BattlegroundQueue::GetQueueId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique queue identifier for this battleground queue instance.
  description: The GetQueueId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a specific battleground queue. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to distinguish between different types of battleground queues, such as those for
    Rated Battlegrounds, Random Battlegrounds, or specific battleground templates.
    The returned value corresponds to the queue's configuration and helps in managing
    player entries, matchmaking logic, and queue-specific behaviors within the game's
    battleground system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique queue identifier for this battleground
    queue instance. This ID typically maps to predefined queue types or configurations
    within the TrinityCore battleground system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Queue ID for Logging
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue* bgQueue = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundQueue(BATTLEGROUND_RB);

      int queueId = bgQueue->GetQueueId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bg.queue", "Current queue ID: %d", queueId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any computation or side
    effects. The queue ID returned should be treated as a constant value for the lifetime
    of the BattlegroundQueue instance.
