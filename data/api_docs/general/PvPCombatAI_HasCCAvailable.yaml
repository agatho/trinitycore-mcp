  method: HasCCAvailable
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::HasCCAvailable(int * player, CCType ccType) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a crowd control ability available for use.
  description: The HasCCAvailable method determines whether a player character possesses
    an active or usable crowd control (CC) ability within their current combat state.
    This method is typically used in AI logic to evaluate the availability of CC abilities
    before attempting to apply them during PvP encounters. It considers factors such
    as cooldowns, resource requirements, and the player's current class-specific CC
    abilities. The method returns true if at least one CC ability is available for
    immediate use, and false otherwise. This functionality is critical for implementing
    intelligent combat decision-making in PvP scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose CC availability is being checked.
      Must not be null.
  - name: ccType
    description: 'Enumeration value specifying the type of crowd control ability to
      check for. Valid values include: CC_TYPE_ROOT, CC_TYPE_SILENCE, CC_TYPE_STUN,
      CC_TYPE_FEAR, CC_TYPE_POLYMORPH, etc., depending on the implementation.'
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has at least one usable crowd control
    ability of the given type available; otherwise returns false. The method does
    not distinguish between different types of CC abilities unless explicitly configured
    to do so.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP AI Logic
    code: "if (pvpAI->HasCCAvailable(player, CC_TYPE_STUN)) {\n    // Attempt to apply\
      \ stun on target\n    player->CastSpell(target, STUN_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple CC Types
    code: "bool hasRoot = pvpAI->HasCCAvailable(player, CC_TYPE_ROOT);\nbool hasSilence\
      \ = pvpAI->HasCCAvailable(player, CC_TYPE_SILENCE);\nif (hasRoot || hasSilence)\
      \ {\n    // Select appropriate CC based on situation\n    if (hasRoot) player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ ROOT_SPELL_ID);\n    else player->CastSpell(target, SILENCE_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's spell cooldown tracking system
    and may consider mana or energy requirements for casting CC abilities. It is intended
    to be called frequently during AI decision-making loops, so performance should
    be optimized. The implementation details depend on how TrinityCore handles class-specific
    CC abilities and their availability checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also note
    that this method may return false even if a player has CC abilities available
    if those abilities are currently on cooldown or lack required resources.
