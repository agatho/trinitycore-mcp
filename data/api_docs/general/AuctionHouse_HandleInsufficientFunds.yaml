  class: AuctionHouse
  method: HandleInsufficientFunds
  signature: void AuctionHouse::HandleInsufficientFunds(int * player, uint32 requiredAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the scenario when a player attempts an auction transaction but does
    not have sufficient funds to complete it.
  description: The HandleInsufficientFunds method is responsible for managing cases
    where a player tries to place an auction bid or list an item for auction, but
    their current gold balance is insufficient to cover the required amount. This
    method typically triggers appropriate in-game feedback to the player, such as
    displaying a message indicating they lack sufficient funds and preventing the
    transaction from proceeding. It may also log the event for administrative purposes
    or trigger additional game mechanics related to player financial behavior. The
    method is part of the AuctionHouse class and is invoked internally when validation
    checks fail due to insufficient currency.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) or internal reference. Used to identify which player attempted the transaction.
  - name: requiredAmount
    description: The total amount of gold required to complete the auction transaction.
      This value is compared against the player's current balance to determine if
      funds are sufficient.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Auction Validation
    code: "void AuctionHouse::ValidateAuctionBid(int* playerGuid, uint32 bidAmount)\n\
      {\n    uint32 playerGold = GetPlayerGold(playerGuid);\n    if (bidAmount > playerGold)\n\
      \    {\n        HandleInsufficientFunds(playerGuid, bidAmount);\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Proceed with auction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's session or account data to
    retrieve and update gold balances. It may also send a client-side message or packet
    to inform the user about insufficient funds. Developers should ensure that all
    calls to this method are preceded by appropriate validation checks.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to inconsistent player states,
    such as allowing transactions with insufficient funds or failing to notify players
    correctly. Ensure that the player pointer is valid and that requiredAmount is
    a positive value before calling this function.
