  method: GetState
  signature: LfgState LfgGroupData::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of the LFG group.
  description: The GetState method returns the current LfgState enum value that represents
    the operational state of the Looking for Group (LFG) system for this specific
    group. This state indicates whether the group is in a waiting, joining, or completed
    phase within the LFG framework. The returned state can be used to determine what
    actions are allowed or expected from the group at any given time during the LFG
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: The current LfgState of the group. Possible values include LFG_STATE_NONE,
    LFG_STATE_ROLECHECK, LFG_STATE_JOINING, LFG_STATE_SUGGESTIONS, LFG_STATE_COMPLETE,
    and LFG_STATE_FAILED, each representing a distinct phase in the LFG workflow.
  examples:
  - title: Check Group State Before Joining
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = ...;\nLfgState state = groupData->GetState();\n\
      if (state == LFG_STATE_NONE || state == LFG_STATE_COMPLETE)\n{\n    // Allow\
      \ new players to join\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. It provides
    a snapshot of the group's current LFG status at the time of invocation, which
    may change immediately after the call.
