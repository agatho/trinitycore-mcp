  method: GetBankTab
  signature: const BankTab * Guild::GetBankTab(uint8 tabId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a pointer to the specified bank tab of the guild.
  description: The GetBankTab method retrieves a const pointer to a BankTab object
    corresponding to the given tab ID within the guild's bank system. This method
    allows access to the contents and properties of a specific guild bank tab, such
    as its name, icon, and item storage. The returned pointer is const, meaning it
    should not be modified directly. In TrinityCore, guilds can have multiple bank
    tabs, each with distinct configurations for storing items. The tab ID parameter
    corresponds to the index of the tab in the guild's bank tab array, typically ranging
    from 0 to the maximum number of tabs supported by the game. This method is commonly
    used when displaying or managing guild bank contents.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the BankTab object associated with the specified tab
    ID. Returns nullptr if the tab ID is invalid or exceeds the maximum allowed number
    of tabs for the guild.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific bank tab
    code: "Guild* guild = ...; // Assume guild is initialized\nconst BankTab* tab\
      \ = guild->GetBankTab(0);\nif (tab)\n{\n    // Use tab data, e.g., display name\
      \ or items\n    sLog->outString(\"Bank Tab Name: %s\", tab->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all bank tabs
    code: "Guild* guild = ...;\nfor (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_GUILD_BANK_TABS; ++i)\n\
      {\n    const BankTab* tab = guild->GetBankTab(i);\n    if (tab)\n    {\n   \
      \     // Process each valid tab\n        sLog->outString(\"Processing tab %u:\
      \ %s\", i, tab->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally.
    If accessed from multiple threads concurrently, external synchronization may be
    required. The returned BankTab pointer is only valid as long as the guild object
    remains in memory and has not been destroyed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid tab IDs; it will return
    a nullptr which must be checked before dereferencing to prevent crashes. Also,
    since the returned pointer is const, modifications to the BankTab should be done
    through appropriate guild bank management methods rather than direct manipulation
    of the returned object.
