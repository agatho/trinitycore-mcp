  class: DynamicObject
  method: SetCasterViewpoint
  signature: void DynamicObject::SetCasterViewpoint()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dynamic object's visual viewpoint to match its caster's orientation
    and position.
  description: The SetCasterViewpoint method synchronizes the visual representation
    of a dynamic object with the orientation and location of its caster. This ensures
    that effects such as area-of-effect spells or summoned objects appear correctly
    positioned relative to the casting unit. The method typically updates internal
    transformation matrices or positioning data to reflect the caster's current state,
    including rotation and spatial coordinates. It is commonly invoked during spell
    effect application or when a dynamic object needs to maintain alignment with its
    originating caster throughout its duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void FireballSpell::EffectExecute(Unit* caster, DynamicObject* dynObj)\n\
      {\n    dynObj->SetCasterViewpoint();\n    // Dynamic object now aligns with\
      \ caster's orientation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called repeatedly during the lifetime of a dynamic object
    to maintain proper alignment if the caster moves or rotates. It is part of the
    core rendering and positioning system for dynamic objects in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null dynamic object pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the dynamic object has been properly initialized before
    invoking this method.
