  method: IsCaster
  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsCaster(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified target unit is a caster, based on their
    spell casting behavior and abilities.
  description: The IsCaster method evaluates whether a given Unit object represents
    a creature or player that has the capability to cast spells. This determination
    is typically used in AI logic to make decisions about targeting, spell selection,
    and combat strategy. The method checks various internal flags and properties of
    the unit to ascertain if it can perform spellcasting actions. It's commonly employed
    in target scanning systems where the AI needs to prioritize or avoid certain types
    of enemies based on their magical capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is capable of casting spells, false otherwise.
    This includes both player characters and NPC creatures that have spellcasting
    abilities defined in their database entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (scanner.IsCaster(target)) {\n    // Prioritize this target for magic-based\
      \ attacks\n    DoMagicAttack(target);\n} else {\n    // Use physical attack\
      \ instead\n    DoPhysicalAttack(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering targets in a custom AI behavior
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> casterTargets;\nfor (auto& target : possibleTargets)\
      \ {\n    if (scanner.IsCaster(target)) {\n        casterTargets.push_back(target);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Use casterTargets for spell targeting logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal unit flags and database configurations. It
    may return false for units that have spellcasting abilities disabled through game
    mechanics or scripting, even if they would normally be considered casters.
  warnings: The method does not account for temporary state changes such as spell
    interruption or casting delays. It only evaluates the base casting capability
    of the unit at the time of the check.
