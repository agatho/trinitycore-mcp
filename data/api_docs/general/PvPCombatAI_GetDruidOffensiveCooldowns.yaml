  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetDruidOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active offensive cooldowns for a druid player in PvP
    combat.
  description: The GetDruidOffensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the number
    of offensive abilities currently on cooldown for a druid character engaged in
    Player versus Player (PvP) combat. This method is typically used by AI systems
    to determine the druid's available offensive options and manage ability usage
    during PvP encounters. The method takes a pointer to a player object as input,
    which must be a valid druid instance in a PvP context. It evaluates the druid's
    current cooldown state for offensive spells and abilities such as Swipe, Mangle,
    and other damaging skills that are relevant to PvP gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player object representing the druid character in PvP
      combat. Must be a valid druid instance with active PvP status.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the count of offensive cooldowns
    currently active for the druid player. A return value of 0 indicates no offensive
    abilities are on cooldown, while positive values indicate the number of cooldowns
    in effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* druidPlayer = ...; // Valid druid player object\nint cooldownCount\
      \ = pvpAI->GetDruidOffensiveCooldowns(druidPlayer);\nif (cooldownCount == 0)\
      \ {\n    // All offensive abilities are available\n    // Execute offensive\
      \ action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: PvP Combat Decision Making
    code: "void PvPCombatAI::MakeOffensiveDecision(Player* player) {\n    if (player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_DRUID) {\n        int cooldowns = GetDruidOffensiveCooldowns(player);\n\
      \        if (cooldowns < 3) {\n            // Use offensive ability if less\
      \ than 3 cooldowns active\n            CastOffensiveAbility(player);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within AI decision-making logic for druid characters
    in PvP scenarios. The implementation likely checks the player's spell cooldowns
    and filters them based on offensive abilities relevant to PvP combat. Performance
    considerations should be noted as this method may involve iterating through the
    player's active spells and checking their cooldown status.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and represents a druid
    character in PvP combat, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method assumes
    the player object has proper PvP state and spell tracking enabled.
