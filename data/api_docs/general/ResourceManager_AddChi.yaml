documentation:
  brief: Adds the specified amount of Chi to the player's resource pool
  description: The AddChi method increases the player's Chi resource by the given
    amount. This method is typically used in conjunction with various game mechanics
    such as energy management, ability usage, or resource regeneration systems within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method does not perform any validation on the input
    amount and directly modifies the internal Chi counter. It is commonly invoked
    during gameplay events like spell casting, ability activation, or periodic resource
    updates.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of Chi to add to the player's resource pool. Must be
      a non-negative integer value representing the amount of Chi to increment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Addition
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ResourceManager* resourceManager = player->GetResourceManager();

      resourceManager->AddChi(10); // Adds 10 Chi to the player''s pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Chi Based on Ability Effect
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 chiGain = player->GetSpellInfo()->GetChiGain();\n\
      if (chiGain > 0)\n{\n    player->GetResourceManager()->AddChi(chiGain);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal Chi counter without any checks
    for maximum limits or resource caps. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction
    with other resource management functions to ensure proper game balance and prevent
    overflow conditions.
  warnings: Using large values for 'amount' may cause unexpected behavior if not properly
    bounded by game logic. Ensure that Chi additions are within reasonable bounds
    to maintain gameplay balance.
