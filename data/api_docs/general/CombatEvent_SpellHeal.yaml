  class: CombatEvent
  method: SpellHeal
  signature: CombatEvent CombatEvent::SpellHeal(int caster, int target, uint32 spellId,
    int32 heal)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a CombatEvent object representing a spell healing action
    in the game.
  description: The SpellHeal method constructs a CombatEvent instance that represents
    a successful healing spell cast by a caster on a target. This event encapsulates
    all relevant information about the healing action, including the caster's identifier,
    target's identifier, the spell ID of the healing ability used, and the amount
    of health restored. The method is typically used within combat logging systems
    or event handlers to track and process healing events in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server environment. It ensures proper event creation for further processing by
    combat managers or loggers.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity casting the healing spell.
      This is typically a player, NPC, or pet.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity receiving the healing.
      This can be any unit that can be healed.
  - name: spellId
    description: The numeric ID of the spell being cast. This identifies which specific
      healing spell was used (e.g., Holy Light, Healing Touch).
  - name: heal
    description: The amount of health points restored by the healing spell. Can be
      negative to represent overhealing or damage in some contexts.
  returns: A CombatEvent object initialized with the provided caster, target, spell
    ID, and heal values, ready for processing or logging within the combat system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Event Creation
    code: CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellHeal(12345, 67890, 20216, 1500); //
      Holy Light healing 1500 health
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Healing Event for Overheal
    code: CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellHeal(54321, 98765, 12345, -300); //
      Healing that exceeds target's max health
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform validation
    checks. The returned CombatEvent object should be immediately processed or stored
    for later use in combat logging systems. It is recommended to verify spellId validity
    before calling this method to ensure proper event handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster and target GUIDs are valid and represent existing
    units in the world, otherwise the event may not process correctly. The heal parameter
    can be negative but should be handled carefully as it might indicate overhealing
    or other edge cases.
