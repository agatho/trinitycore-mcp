  method: GetDefenderTeam
  signature: int Battlefield::GetDefenderTeam() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of the defending faction in a battlefield.
  description: The GetDefenderTeam method retrieves the team identifier associated
    with the defending faction in a battlefield instance. This value typically corresponds
    to either TEAM_ALLIANCE (0) or TEAM_HORDE (1), indicating which faction is currently
    assigned as the defender in the battlefield. The method is commonly used during
    battlefield initialization and state management to determine the opposing forces
    involved in the conflict. It provides essential information for determining win
    conditions, reward distribution, and faction-based interactions within the battlefield
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the defending team ID. Typically returns
    0 for Alliance or 1 for Horde. In rare cases, it may return -1 if the battlefield
    is in an invalid state or has not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Defender Team
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int defenderTeam = bf->GetDefenderTeam();\n    if (defenderTeam\
      \ == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_DEFENDER_ALLIANCE);\n\
      \    else if (defenderTeam == TEAM_HORDE)\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_DEFENDER_HORDE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. The returned
    value should not be modified directly as it reflects the internal state of the
    battlefield. The method may return -1 if called before the battlefield has been
    fully initialized or during cleanup phases.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-negative return value always indicates a valid
    team. Always validate the return value against known constants (TEAM_ALLIANCE,
    TEAM_HORDE) rather than relying on specific numeric values. Calling this method
    on a destroyed or uninitialized battlefield instance may result in undefined behavior.
