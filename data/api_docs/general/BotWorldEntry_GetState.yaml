  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: GetState
  signature: BotWorldEntryState BotWorldEntry::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of the bot world entry.
  description: The GetState method returns the BotWorldEntryState enum value that
    represents the current operational or logical state of the bot world entry. This
    state typically indicates whether the entry is active, inactive, initializing,
    or in some other defined condition within the game's bot management system. The
    returned state can be used by other systems to determine how to interact with
    or process the bot entry. The method is read-only and does not modify any internal
    data of the BotWorldEntry object.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A BotWorldEntryState enum value indicating the current state of the bot
    world entry. Possible values may include but are not limited to: ACTIVE, INACTIVE,
    INITIALIZING, ERROR, or DESTROYED, depending on the implementation and game logic.'
  examples:
  - title: Check if a bot is active
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = GetBotWorldEntry();\nif (entry->GetState() == BotWorldEntryState::ACTIVE)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Log current state for debugging
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* entry = GetBotWorldEntry();

      BotWorldEntryState state = entry->GetState();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("bot", "Bot world entry state: {}", static_cast<int>(state));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with state transition logic
    within the bot management system. It's important to note that the returned state
    may change dynamically as the bot's lifecycle progresses, so repeated calls might
    return different values over time.
