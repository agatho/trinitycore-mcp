documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for all holy paladin abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets the cooldown timers
    for all applicable holy paladin abilities and spells. This method is typically
    called during character initialization or when a new encounter begins to ensure
    that all cooldowns are properly reset and ready for use. It ensures that no abilities
    are incorrectly on cooldown at the start of an encounter, which is crucial for
    proper gameplay balance and ability usage mechanics in TrinityCore's implementation
    of the holy paladin class.

  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization or at the start
    of a new combat encounter to reset all cooldowns. It is assumed that the paladin
    object has been properly constructed and initialized before calling this method.
