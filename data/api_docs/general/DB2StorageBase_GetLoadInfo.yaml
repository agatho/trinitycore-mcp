  signature: const DB2LoadInfo * DB2StorageBase::GetLoadInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the database load information structure associated with this DB2
    storage instance.
  description: The GetLoadInfo method provides access to the DB2LoadInfo structure
    that contains metadata about how a DB2 file is loaded into memory. This includes
    details such as field counts, offsets, and data types for each column in the database
    table. The returned pointer points to an immutable structure that describes the
    layout of the data within the storage container. This method is typically used
    during initialization and loading phases of DB2 data processing to ensure proper
    interpretation of raw binary data. The information returned is essential for parsing
    and accessing field values correctly from loaded DB2 records.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a DB2LoadInfo structure that contains metadata describing
    the layout and format of the DB2 file's data fields, or nullptr if no load information
    is available.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Load Information for DB2 Storage
    code: "DB2StorageBase* storage = sDB2Manager->GetStorage(\"Creature\");\nconst\
      \ DB2LoadInfo* loadInfo = storage->GetLoadInfo();\nif (loadInfo)\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Field count: %u\\n\", loadInfo->FieldCount);\n    printf(\"Record size: %u bytes\\\
      n\", loadInfo->RecordSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned DB2LoadInfo structure is owned by the DB2StorageBase instance
    and should not be modified or freed. This method is thread-safe as long as the
    underlying storage object remains valid during access.
