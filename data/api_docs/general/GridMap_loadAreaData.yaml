documentation:
  brief: Loads area data from a file into the grid map
  description: The loadAreaData method reads area-related data from a specified file
    stream and loads it into the GridMap instance. This method is typically used during
    map initialization or loading phases to populate the grid with area information
    such as zone boundaries, area triggers, and other spatial data. The method requires
    a valid file handle, an offset indicating where in the file to start reading,
    and a size specifying how many bytes to read. It returns true upon successful
    loading of the data, or false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters,
    file errors, or insufficient data.
  parameters:
  - name: in
    description: A pointer to an open FILE stream from which the area data will be
      read. The file must be opened in binary mode and positioned at the correct location
      before calling this method.
  - name: offset
    description: The byte offset within the file where the area data begins. This
      value determines the starting position for reading the data from the file stream.
  - name: size
    description: The number of bytes to read from the file starting at the specified
      offset. This parameter defines how much data to load into the grid map's area
      data structures.
  returns: Returns true if the area data was successfully loaded from the file into
    the GridMap instance; otherwise, returns false if an error occurred during the
    loading process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of loadAreaData
    code: "FILE* file = fopen(\"map_area_data.bin\", \"rb\");\nif (file != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    GridMap map;\n    bool success = map.loadAreaData(file, 1024, 2048);\n\
      \    if (!success) {\n        // Handle error\n        printf(\"Failed to load\
      \ area data\\n\");\n    }\n    fclose(file);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map loading mechanism in TrinityCore
    and is usually invoked during server startup or when loading specific map grids.
    The file must be properly formatted with area data structures that match what
    the GridMap expects. Improperly aligned offsets or incorrect sizes can lead to
    memory corruption or incomplete data loading.
  warnings: Ensure that the FILE pointer is valid and opened in binary mode before
    calling this method. Passing invalid offset or size values may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method does not perform any validation on the loaded
    data, so it's important to ensure the input file contains correct area data structures.
