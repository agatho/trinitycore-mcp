  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: FindQuestObjectiveLocation
  signature: NpcLocationResult BotNpcLocationService::FindQuestObjectiveLocation(Player
    * bot, uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the location of a quest objective for a bot player.
  description: The FindQuestObjectiveLocation method locates the specific position
    where a quest objective associated with a given quest ID and objective index can
    be found. It is primarily used by bot AI systems to determine where to move or
    interact with game objects related to active quests. The method returns an NpcLocationResult
    structure containing the coordinates and map information for the quest objective.
    This functionality supports automated quest completion for bot characters within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for which
      the quest objective location is being searched.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the objective location is
      being retrieved. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index indicating which objective within the quest should
      be located. Valid range depends on the number of objectives defined for the
      specified quest.
  returns: NpcLocationResult structure containing the x, y, z coordinates and map
    ID where the quest objective is located. Returns an invalid result if no location
    is found or if parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a quest objective location
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;\nNpcLocationResult result = sBotNpcLocationService->FindQuestObjectiveLocation(bot,\
      \ questId, objectiveIndex);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Use result coordinates\
      \ to move the bot\n    bot->TeleportTo(result.mapId, result.x, result.y, result.z,\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and may not work correctly
    if quest information is not fully loaded or cached. The method might return an
    invalid result if the specified objective index exceeds the number of objectives
    defined for the quest.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player is valid and has the specified quest active
    before calling this method. Calling with invalid quest IDs or objective indices
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
