  class: BotLifecycle
  method: Start
  signature: bool BotLifecycle::Start()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and begins the bot lifecycle process, setting up necessary components
    for bot operation.
  description: The Start method initializes the bot lifecycle by performing essential
    setup operations required for a bot to function within the TrinityCore environment.
    This includes initializing internal data structures, establishing connections,
    and preparing the bot for execution. The method ensures that all prerequisites
    are met before beginning bot operations and returns a boolean value indicating
    success or failure of the initialization process. This method is typically called
    once during the bot's creation or activation phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot lifecycle was successfully started and initialized,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate failed initialization, missing
    dependencies, or invalid configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Lifecycle Start
    code: "BotLifecycle bot;\nbool success = bot.Start();\nif (success) {\n    //\
      \ Bot is now initialized and ready for use\n    printf(\"Bot started successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ start bot\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance. Subsequent calls
    may result in undefined behavior or failed initialization. The method performs
    critical setup operations that are required for proper bot functionality, so it's
    important to check the return value before proceeding with other operations.
  warnings: Calling Start() on an already initialized bot may lead to resource leaks
    or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that any previous lifecycle is properly
    terminated before calling this method again. The method may block during initialization
    if network or system resources are not immediately available.
