  class: IBotSession
  method: Update
  signature: void IBotSession::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot session state with the specified time difference.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    internal state of a bot session over time. It accepts a time delta (diff) parameter
    that represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since the last update call.
    This method typically handles AI decision-making, movement updates, combat logic,
    and other time-dependent behaviors for the bot. The implementation ensures that
    all bot-related systems are synchronized with the game's time progression and
    maintain consistent behavior across different server tick rates.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed for processing AI behaviors,
      movement calculations, and other time-sensitive operations within the bot session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& session : botSessions)\n\
      \    {\n        session->Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void BotSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsAlive())\n    {\n  \
      \      ProcessAI(diff);\n        UpdateMovement(diff);\n        HandleCombat(diff);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        RespawnIfNeeded();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or a dedicated bot
    update thread. It's important to ensure that the diff parameter accurately reflects
    real-world time passage for consistent AI behavior. The method may perform blocking
    operations during AI processing, so frequent calls with small time deltas are
    recommended for smooth performance.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization. Passing incorrect or negative diff values can lead to unpredictable
    AI behavior and potential crashes. Avoid calling Update() in a tight loop without
    proper throttling as it may cause excessive CPU usage.
