  signature: bool MovementRequest::CanBeInterrupted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a movement request can be interrupted by external factors.
  description: The CanBeInterrupted method evaluates if a given movement request is
    susceptible to interruption during execution. This is typically used in AI and
    movement systems to control how player or NPC movements respond to events such
    as combat, environmental changes, or other game mechanics. The method returns
    true if the movement can be interrupted, and false if it must complete regardless
    of external influences. This functionality is crucial for implementing realistic
    character behavior and ensuring proper handling of dynamic game states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement request can be interrupted by external factors
    such as combat initiation or environmental changes; returns false if the movement
    must complete uninterrupted, typically used for critical actions like casting
    spells or performing special animations.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a movement can be interrupted
    code: "if (movementRequest->CanBeInterrupted()) {\n    // Handle interruption\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Movement can be interrupted\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Movement\
      \ must complete\n    printf(\"Movement cannot be interrupted\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement update cycles in the game
    engine. It's important to note that even if a movement can be interrupted, the
    actual interruption logic must be handled separately by the calling code or system.
