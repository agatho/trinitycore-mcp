  method: ShouldDoCorpseRun
  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::ShouldDoCorpseRun() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a corpse run should be executed for a player's death.
  description: The ShouldDoCorpseRun method evaluates conditions to decide if a player's
    corpse should be moved to a designated location upon death. This typically occurs
    in scenarios where the player dies in a non-standard location, such as during
    combat or in areas where normal corpse placement is not allowed. The method checks
    various game state factors including player status, zone restrictions, and server
    configuration settings to determine if a special corpse handling routine should
    be initiated. It is part of the death recovery system that manages how players'
    bodies are handled after they perish.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the corpse run logic should be executed for the player's
    death, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that special handling
    is required for the corpse placement, while false means standard corpse behavior
    applies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death handling
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.ShouldDoCorpseRun()) {\n    // Execute custom\
      \ corpse run logic\n    player->SetCorpseLocation(player->GetPosition());\n\
      \    player->SendCorpseReclaimDelay();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the death processing phase of a player's
    lifecycle. It may be influenced by server-side configuration options related to
    corpse placement and player recovery mechanics. The implementation likely considers
    factors such as whether the player is in a PvP zone, if they have certain buffs
    or debuffs, or if they are in a specific game state that requires special handling.
