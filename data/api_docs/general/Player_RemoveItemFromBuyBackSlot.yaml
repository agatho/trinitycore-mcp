  signature: void Player::RemoveItemFromBuyBackSlot(uint32 slot, bool del)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from the player's buyback slot and returns it to the player's
    inventory.
  description: This method removes an item from the player's buyback slot, which is
    a temporary storage area for items that have been sold back to NPCs. The method
    allows the player to retrieve items that were previously sold back to vendors,
    effectively restoring them to their original inventory. The buyback slot is typically
    used when a player sells an item to an NPC and then wants to retrieve it later.
    This method handles the removal of items from the buyback slot while maintaining
    proper inventory management and ensuring that the item is properly restored to
    the player's inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The buyback slot index from which the item should be removed. Valid
      values are 0-127, representing the specific slot in the buyback storage where
      items are stored.
  - name: del
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the item should be deleted from
      the game world. If true, the item is completely removed from the game world;
      if false, the item is restored to the player's inventory but remains in the
      game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 slot = 0;

      bool deleteItem = false;

      player->RemoveItemFromBuyBackSlot(slot, deleteItem);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 slot = 5;

      bool deleteItem = true;

      player->RemoveItemFromBuyBackSlot(slot, deleteItem);

      // Item is removed from game world completely'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the buyback storage system which is typically implemented
    as a temporary inventory slot. The method ensures that items are properly restored
    to the player's inventory when del is false, and completely removed from the game
    when del is true. This method should be used carefully as it can affect the player's
    inventory management.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper validation of
    the slot index. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid memory access or loss of items.
    The method assumes that the slot exists and contains valid items, so calling it
    on an empty slot may cause issues.
