  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::UpdatePopulationTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the population targets for legacy bot spawners based on current server
    conditions and configuration settings.
  description: The UpdatePopulationTargets method adjusts the target population counts
    for legacy bot spawners within the TrinityCore environment. This method is responsible
    for dynamically modifying how many bots should be spawned or maintained in various
    zones or areas based on configurable thresholds, server load, and other environmental
    factors. It typically runs during periodic updates or when system conditions change,
    ensuring that bot populations remain within desired parameters for gameplay balance
    and testing purposes. The method does not take any parameters and performs its
    operations internally using the adapter's configuration and current world state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // Periodically update population targets\n   \
      \ legacyBotSpawnerAdapter.UpdatePopulationTargets();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game loop or a dedicated scheduler
    thread. It may have performance implications if called too frequently, as it involves
    reading configuration data and potentially modifying spawn point states. Ensure
    that the underlying configuration system is thread-safe when this method is used
    in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the intended update cycle might lead to
    inconsistent bot population counts or unexpected behavior. Avoid calling it from
    within critical sections where other spawner operations are active to prevent
    race conditions.
