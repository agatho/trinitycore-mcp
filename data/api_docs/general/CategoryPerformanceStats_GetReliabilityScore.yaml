  signature: double CategoryPerformanceStats::GetReliabilityScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reliability score for a category performance statistics
    object.
  description: The GetReliabilityScore method computes a numerical reliability score
    based on the internal performance metrics stored within the CategoryPerformanceStats
    object. This score typically reflects how consistently or reliably a particular
    category of performance (e.g., quest completion, PvP kills, etc.) has been maintained
    over time. The exact calculation logic is determined by the implementation and
    may consider factors such as success rates, consistency, deviation from expected
    values, or other statistical measures relevant to the category's performance data.
    This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double-precision floating-point number representing the calculated reliability
    score. The value typically ranges between 0.0 (lowest reliability) and 1.0 (highest
    reliability), though specific bounds may vary depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats;

      // Assume stats is populated with performance data

      const double reliability = stats.GetReliabilityScore();

      std::cout << "Reliability Score: " << reliability << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Reliability Score in Conditional Logic
    code: "CategoryPerformanceStats playerStats;\n// Assume playerStats is initialized\
      \ with data\nconst double score = playerStats.GetReliabilityScore();\nif (score\
      \ >= 0.9) {\n    std::cout << \"Highly reliable performance detected.\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else if (score >= 0.7) {\n    std::cout << \"Moderately reliable performance.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Low reliability - performance\
      \ needs improvement.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be used in performance analysis or reporting systems
    where quantifiable reliability metrics are required. It should not be called excessively
    in performance-critical sections due to potential computational overhead from
    statistical calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the CategoryPerformanceStats object has been properly initialized
    with valid performance data before calling this method, as undefined behavior
    may occur if internal state is invalid or uninitialized.
