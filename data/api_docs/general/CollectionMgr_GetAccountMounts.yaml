  class: CollectionMgr
  method: GetAccountMounts
  signature: const MountContainer & CollectionMgr::GetAccountMounts() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the collection of mounts associated with the account.
  description: The GetAccountMounts method returns a constant reference to the MountContainer
    that holds all mounts currently available to the account. This container typically
    includes mounts obtained through various means such as achievements, quests, or
    purchases within the game. The returned reference allows read-only access to the
    mount collection without copying the data, ensuring efficient performance. This
    method is commonly used in player interaction systems where mount availability
    needs to be checked or displayed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a MountContainer object that contains all mounts
    associated with the account. The container can be iterated over to access individual
    mount entries.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Account Mounts
    code: "const MountContainer& mounts = collectionMgr->GetAccountMounts();\nfor\
      \ (const auto& mount : mounts)\n{\n    // Process each mount\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Mount ID: \" << mount.first << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned MountContainer is managed internally by the CollectionMgr and
    should not be modified directly. Accessing this container does not trigger any
    additional database queries or computations, making it efficient for frequent
    calls.
