  signature: uint64 CalendarInvite::GetInviteId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the calendar invite.
  description: The GetInviteId method returns the unique 64-bit identifier associated
    with a calendar invite object. This identifier is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to track and manage calendar invitations within the game world. The returned
    value serves as a key for referencing specific invites in database operations
    and event handling systems. This method does not perform any validation or modification
    of the invite state; it simply retrieves the pre-assigned ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique identifier of the calendar invite.
    This ID is guaranteed to be non-zero for valid invites and can be used to uniquely
    identify the invite across all calendar-related operations in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = ...; // Assume invite is initialized

      uint64 inviteId = invite->GetInviteId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("calendar", "Retrieved invite ID: {}", inviteId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Invite ID for Database Lookup
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = ...;\nuint64 inviteId = invite->GetInviteId();\n\
      // Use inviteId to query database for additional invite details\nif (sCalendarMgr->GetInvite(inviteId))\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"calendar\", \"Found invite with ID: {}\", inviteId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The invite ID is typically assigned when the CalendarInvite object is created
    and remains constant throughout its lifetime. This method is thread-safe as it
    only reads from a stored value without modifying any internal state.
