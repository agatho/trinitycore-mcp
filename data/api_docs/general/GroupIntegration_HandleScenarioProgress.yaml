  class: GroupIntegration
  method: HandleScenarioProgress
  signature: void GroupIntegration::HandleScenarioProgress(Group * group, uint32 objectiveId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates scenario progress for all members of a group when a specific objective
    is completed.
  description: The HandleScenarioProgress method processes and propagates scenario
    objective completion events to all players within a specified group. This method
    is typically invoked when a group member achieves a scenario objective, ensuring
    that all group members receive appropriate updates to their scenario progress
    tracking. The method handles synchronization of scenario data across the group,
    potentially updating quest objectives, rewards, or other scenario-related game
    state for each group member. It's designed to maintain consistency in group-based
    scenario progression and ensure that all players are aware of shared scenario
    milestones.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose scenario
      progress needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: objectiveId
    description: Unique identifier for the scenario objective that has been completed.
      This ID corresponds to a specific objective within the scenario framework and
      determines which progress updates are applied to group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when completing a scenario objective
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    GroupIntegration::HandleScenarioProgress(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with scenario completion validation
    code: "if (scenarioObjectiveCompleted)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && group->IsInScenario())\n    {\n        GroupIntegration::HandleScenarioProgress(group,\
      \ objectiveId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and contains players who are
    participating in a scenario. The implementation likely involves iterating through
    all group members and updating their individual scenario progress state. Performance
    considerations include potential network synchronization overhead when updating
    multiple players simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences. The objectiveId must correspond to an actual scenario
    objective, otherwise the method may not perform expected updates or could cause
    unexpected behavior.
