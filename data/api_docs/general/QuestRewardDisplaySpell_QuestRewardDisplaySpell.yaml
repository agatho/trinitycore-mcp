  method: QuestRewardDisplaySpell
  signature: void QuestRewardDisplaySpell::QuestRewardDisplaySpell(uint32 spellId,
    uint32 playerConditionId, QuestCompleteSpellType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a quest reward display spell with specified spell ID, player
    condition ID, and quest complete spell type.
  description: The QuestRewardDisplaySpell constructor initializes a quest reward
    display spell object by setting its internal spell ID, player condition ID, and
    quest complete spell type. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to manage how spells are displayed as rewards for completing quests.
    The spell ID identifies which spell will be shown or applied, the player condition
    ID determines if the player meets specific requirements for the reward, and the
    quest complete spell type defines the context in which the spell is applied (e.g.,
    whether it's a direct reward, a conditional effect, or part of a quest completion
    sequence). This initialization is crucial for proper quest reward handling in
    World of Warcraft-style gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be displayed as a quest reward.
      Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: playerConditionId
    description: The player condition identifier used to validate if the player meets
      prerequisites for receiving this quest reward. Must reference an existing player
      condition in the database.
  - name: type
    description: The type of quest complete spell, determining how the spell is applied.
      Valid values are typically defined by the QuestCompleteSpellType enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a Basic Quest Reward Display Spell
    code: QuestRewardDisplaySpell rewardSpell(12345, 67890, QUEST_COMPLETE_SPELL_TYPE_DIRECT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Up a Conditional Quest Reward Display Spell
    code: 'QuestRewardDisplaySpell conditionalReward(54321, 98765, QUEST_COMPLETE_SPELL_TYPE_CONDITIONAL);

      // This spell will only be applied if player meets the specified condition.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of an internal system used by TrinityCore's quest
    handling logic. It should not be called directly from game scripts or external
    modules unless implementing custom quest reward systems. The spell ID and player
    condition ID must exist in the database to ensure proper functionality.
  warnings: Incorrect spell IDs or player condition IDs can lead to missing rewards
    or runtime errors. Ensure all parameters reference valid entries in the database
    before calling this constructor.
