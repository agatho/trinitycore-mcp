  class: GuildBankManager
  method: IdentifyDuplicateItems
  signature: int GuildBankManager::IdentifyDuplicateItems(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Identifies and counts duplicate items within the guild bank inventory.
  description: The IdentifyDuplicateItems method scans the entire guild bank inventory
    to detect items that appear multiple times across different slots. It returns
    a count of how many duplicate item entries exist in the guild bank, which can
    be useful for identifying potential data inconsistencies or for implementing guild
    bank management features such as item consolidation. This method does not modify
    any data but provides diagnostic information about the current state of the guild
    bank inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the guild identifier (GUID)
      for which duplicate items are being identified. This parameter is used to determine
      which guild's bank inventory should be scanned.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of duplicate item entries
    found in the specified guild's bank inventory. A return value of zero indicates
    no duplicates were found, while a positive integer indicates the count of duplicated
    items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nint duplicateCount = guildBankManager->IdentifyDuplicateItems(&guildId);\n\
      if (duplicateCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d duplicate items in guild bank\\\
      n\", duplicateCount);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No duplicates found in guild bank\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called on large guild
    banks with many items, as it requires iterating through all slots in the inventory.
    It is recommended to cache results or call this method sparingly during high-frequency
    operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided guild identifier is valid and corresponds to
    an existing guild, otherwise behavior is undefined. The method assumes exclusive
    access to the guild bank data structure during execution.
