  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: GenerateRandomSolution
  signature: int RoleOptimizer::GenerateRandomSolution(const int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a random solution for role optimization within a group of players
  description: The GenerateRandomSolution method creates a randomized assignment of
    roles to players in a group context, typically used for optimizing team compositions
    in World of Warcraft scenarios such as dungeons or raids. This method is part
    of the RoleOptimizer class which handles dynamic role distribution based on various
    factors including player capabilities and group requirements. The generated solution
    represents one possible valid configuration that satisfies certain constraints
    defined by the optimizer. It does not guarantee optimal performance but provides
    a baseline for further optimization algorithms to work from.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players in the group for which to generate a random
      role solution. Must be a positive integer representing valid player count.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the generated random solution.
    A value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate errors
    or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint solution = optimizer.GenerateRandomSolution(5);\n\
      if (solution >= 0) {\n    // Process the generated role solution\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Generated solution ID: \" << solution << std::endl;\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to generate solution\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any optimization iterations begin. The
    randomness is seeded internally, so multiple calls with the same player count
    may produce different results. Performance is generally O(n) where n is the number
    of players.
  warnings: Ensure that the player count passed to this method is valid and within
    expected bounds to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect role assignments.
