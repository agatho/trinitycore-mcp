documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in war mode state locally.
  description: This method checks if the player is in a war mode state, which typically
    indicates they are engaged in PvP combat or have entered a PvP zone. The method
    returns true when the player's local war mode status is active, and false otherwise.
    This function is commonly used to determine if a player should be considered as
    being in PvP combat, or if they should be able to interact with other players
    in certain ways. It is important to note that this method only checks for local
    war mode state, not global war mode status which might be determined by other
    factors such as server settings or player flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in war mode locally, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's current state allows for PvP interactions
    or not.
