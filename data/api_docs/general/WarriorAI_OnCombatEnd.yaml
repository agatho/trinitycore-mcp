  brief: Handles cleanup and state reset when a warrior AI character exits combat
    mode
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is invoked when a WarriorAI instance transitions
    out of combat state. This method typically performs necessary cleanup operations
    such as resetting combat-related flags, clearing target references, stopping combat-specific
    actions, and potentially triggering post-combat logic like cooldown resets or
    resource management. In the context of TrinityCore's AI framework, this method
    ensures that the AI character properly exits combat state and returns to its default
    non-combat behavior. The method is automatically called by the core AI system
    when combat ends, either through player logout, target death, or other game events
    that terminate combat.

  - title: Basic usage in custom warrior AI implementation
    code: "class MyWarriorAI : public WarriorAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd()\
      \ override {\n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        WarriorAI::OnCombatEnd();\n\
      \        // Additional post-combat handling\n        ResetCooldowns();\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The base implementation typically
    handles core cleanup tasks, so derived classes should call the parent implementation
    when overriding.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI system as it may
    lead to inconsistent state or undefined behavior. When overriding, ensure proper
    chaining to the base class implementation to maintain expected AI behavior.
