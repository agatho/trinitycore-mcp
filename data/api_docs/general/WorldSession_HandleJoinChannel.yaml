    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Joins a player to a specified chat channel in the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The HandleJoinChannel method processes a packet sent by the client
    when a player attempts to join a chat channel. It validates the channel name,
    checks if the player has permission to join, and handles the logic for adding
    the player to the channel's membership list. This method is part of the core communication
    system between the World of Warcraft client and the TrinityCore server, ensuring
    proper channel access control and synchronization of channel states across all
    connected players.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Join
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      WorldPackets::Channel::JoinChannel joinPacket;

      joinPacket.ChannelName = "General";

      joinPacket.ChannelPassword = "";

      session->HandleJoinChannel(joinPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the network packet handling system
    when a client sends a join channel request. It performs necessary checks for channel
    existence, player permissions, and channel restrictions before allowing membership.
    The method does not directly send response packets to the client but may trigger
    subsequent messages like CHANNEL_NOTIFY or CHANNEL_MEMBER_LIST updates.
  warnings: Improper validation of channel names could lead to security vulnerabilities
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all channel operations are properly sanitized
    and validated against server rules. This method should not be called directly
    without proper session context and packet validation.
