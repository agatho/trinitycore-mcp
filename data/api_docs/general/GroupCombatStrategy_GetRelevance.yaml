  class: GroupCombatStrategy
  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float GroupCombatStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of a group combat strategy for
    a given bot AI instance.
  description: The GetRelevance method computes a float value representing how relevant
    or applicable the current GroupCombatStrategy is to the specified BotAI instance.
    This relevance score is typically used by the AI system to determine which combat
    strategy should be prioritized or executed during group encounters. The calculation
    may consider factors such as the bot's class, level, available abilities, current
    target, and group composition. The method is const, indicating it does not modify
    the state of the GroupCombatStrategy object. It serves as a core decision-making
    component in the TrinityCore AI framework for determining optimal combat behavior
    in group scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relevance score. A value
    of 1.0 indicates maximum relevance, while 0.0 indicates no relevance. Intermediate
    values reflect partial relevance to the bot's current combat situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float relevance = strategy.GetRelevance(botAI);\nif (relevance > 0.5f)\
      \ {\n    // Execute this strategy\n    strategy.Execute(botAI);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using relevance to select best strategy
    code: "GroupCombatStrategy* bestStrategy = nullptr;\nfloat bestRelevance = 0.0f;\n\
      \nfor (auto& strategy : availableStrategies) {\n    float relevance = strategy.GetRelevance(botAI);\n\
      \    if (relevance > bestRelevance) {\n        bestRelevance = relevance;\n\
      \        bestStrategy = &strategy;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestStrategy && bestRelevance\
      \ > 0.1f) {\n    bestStrategy->Execute(botAI);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during combat decision loops,
    so performance is important. The relevance calculation should be lightweight to
    avoid impacting overall AI responsiveness. The method assumes the BotAI parameter
    is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is not null, as
    accessing invalid AI data could lead to undefined behavior. The relevance score
    should not be used directly for strategy execution without proper validation of
    the returned value.
