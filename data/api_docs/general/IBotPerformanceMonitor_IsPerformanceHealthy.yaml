  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: IsPerformanceHealthy
  signature: bool IBotPerformanceMonitor::IsPerformanceHealthy() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot's current performance is within acceptable thresholds
    for optimal gameplay.
  description: The IsPerformanceHealthy method evaluates the overall performance state
    of a bot instance to determine if it is operating within predefined healthy limits.
    This typically involves checking metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
    frame rate stability, or other performance indicators that could affect the bot's
    ability to function properly in the game environment. The method returns true
    if all monitored performance factors are within acceptable ranges, indicating
    the bot is performing optimally. It returns false if any performance metric exceeds
    its threshold, signaling potential issues that may require attention or mitigation
    strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the bot's performance is considered
    healthy. Returns true if all performance metrics are within acceptable thresholds;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Check
    code: "if (bot->GetPerformanceMonitor()->IsPerformanceHealthy()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal bot operations\n    bot->Update();\n} else {\n    // Pause or\
      \ reduce bot activity to improve performance\n    bot->SuspendActivity();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the bot's main loop or performance
    monitoring system to make real-time decisions about bot behavior. It may involve
    lightweight checks for performance metrics and should not introduce significant
    overhead during execution.
