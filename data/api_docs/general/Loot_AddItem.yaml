documentation:
  brief: Adds a loot item to the loot collection for a specific entity.
  description: The AddItem method is used to add a LootStoreItem to the internal loot
    list of a Loot object. This typically occurs when a creature or game object is
    looted, and items are added to the loot distribution pool. The method does not
    directly handle the distribution of items to players; instead, it prepares the
    item for potential future distribution. It ensures that the item is properly registered
    within the loot context so that it can be considered during the loot rolling process.
    This method is commonly invoked by game systems when processing creature kills
    or opening game object containers.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A constant reference to a LootStoreItem structure that defines the
      item to be added to the loot. This includes properties such as item ID, chance
      to drop, and other loot-specific parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a loot item to a creature's loot
    code: 'LootStoreItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.chance = 100.0f;

      item.mincount = 1;

      item.maxcount = 1;

      loot->AddItem(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the item data itself, so it's
    expected that the caller ensures the LootStoreItem is valid before passing it
    to AddItem. The actual distribution of items to players is handled separately
    by other systems like the loot rolling mechanism.
