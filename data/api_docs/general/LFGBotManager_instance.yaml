documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LFGBotManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LFGBotManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global LFG bot management
    functionality, which handles group finding and bot-related operations in World
    of Warcraft's Looking For Group system. The returned pointer provides access to
    all LFG bot configuration, status, and control methods. This is a thread-safe
    operation that guarantees consistent access to the singleton instance across different
    parts of the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single LFGBotManager instance. Returns a valid pointer
    to the manager object when called after initialization, or NULL if the manager
    has not been initialized yet.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the LFG Bot Manager
    code: "LFGBotManager* lfgBotMgr = LFGBotManager::instance();\nif (lfgBotMgr !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the manager to control LFG bots\n    lfgBotMgr->StartBotSystem();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bot Status via Singleton
    code: "LFGBotManager* mgr = LFGBotManager::instance();\nif (mgr && mgr->IsBotSystemActive())\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"LFG Bot system is running.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      LFG Bot system is not active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The LFGBotManager
    instance should be initialized before calling this method, typically during server
    startup or module initialization. The singleton instance is created lazily on
    first access, but it's recommended to ensure proper initialization during server
    boot process.
  warnings: Do not manually delete or destroy the returned pointer as it is managed
    by the singleton pattern. Calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously
    is safe, but be cautious about race conditions when modifying shared state through
    the manager instance.
