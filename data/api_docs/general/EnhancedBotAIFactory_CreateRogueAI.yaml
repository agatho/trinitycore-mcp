documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new rogue AI instance for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateRogueAI method is responsible for generating a specialized
    artificial intelligence behavior for a bot player that is classified as a rogue
    class. This method sets up the necessary AI components, behavior patterns, and
    combat strategies specific to rogue gameplay mechanics such as stealth detection,
    poison application, and finishing moves. The function typically integrates with
    TrinityCore's bot system to assign appropriate AI modules and state management
    for rogue-specific abilities. It may also validate that the provided player object
    is a valid bot instance before proceeding with AI initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    insufficient memory, or unsupported player class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rogue AI creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nint result = factory->CreateRogueAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for the rogue bot\n    printf(\"\
      Rogue AI initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to create rogue AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends TrinityCore's
    standard bot functionality. The implementation likely involves setting up specific
    AI decision trees and behavior states for rogue abilities like stealth, poison
    application, and energy management. Developers should ensure that the Player object
    passed to this function has been properly initialized as a bot before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or an uninitialized player may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the provided
    Player pointer is valid and points to a legitimate bot instance with appropriate
    class configuration. Ensure proper error handling around this function call in
    production code.
