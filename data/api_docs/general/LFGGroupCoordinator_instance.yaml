  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LFGGroupCoordinator class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LFGGroupCoordinator
    class, providing global access to a single coordinator object responsible for
    managing Looking For Group (LFG) activities within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that only one instance of LFGGroupCoordinator exists throughout
    the application lifecycle, centralizing LFG group management logic and state.
    The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid during the server's operation and
    should not be deleted by callers. This coordinator handles group matching, queue
    management, and LFG-related communications between players and the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of LFGGroupCoordinator. The return
    value is never null during normal server operation, as the singleton is initialized
    during server startup. If the method fails to initialize properly (which should
    not occur in standard operation), it may return nullptr, though this condition
    is highly unlikely.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing LFG Group Coordinator
    code: "LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = LFGGroupCoordinator::instance();\nif\
      \ (coordinator)\n{\n    // Use the coordinator for LFG operations\n    coordinator->Update();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Coordinator in LFG Context
    code: "void HandleLFGPlayerJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    LFGGroupCoordinator* coord\
      \ = LFGGroupCoordinator::instance();\n    if (coord && player)\n    {\n    \
      \    // Add player to LFG queue\n        coord->AddPlayerToQueue(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton pattern conventions. The LFGGroupCoordinator
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and destroyed at shutdown.
    Since it's a singleton, multiple calls to this method will return the same pointer
    address. The coordinator manages internal state related to player groups, queues,
    and LFG operations, so it's important not to interfere with its lifecycle or attempt
    to create additional instances.
  warnings: Do not delete or attempt to manage the lifetime of the returned pointer.
    As a singleton, the instance is managed by the framework and should only be accessed
    via this method. Avoid calling this method during server initialization before
    the coordinator has been constructed, though in practice this shouldn't occur
    as it's typically called after system initialization.
