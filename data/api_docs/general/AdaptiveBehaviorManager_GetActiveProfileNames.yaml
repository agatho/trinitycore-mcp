  method: GetActiveProfileNames
  signature: int AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetActiveProfileNames() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active behavior profiles managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  description: The GetActiveProfileNames method returns an integer representing the
    number of currently active behavior profiles within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This method is typically used to determine how many behavioral configurations
    are actively being applied to NPCs or game entities. The returned value indicates
    the size of the internal collection tracking active profiles, which may be used
    for debugging, performance monitoring, or conditional logic based on profile availability.
    No parameters are required, and the method performs a read-only operation on the
    manager's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of active behavior profiles currently
    managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. A return value of zero indicates no active
    profiles exist, while positive values indicate the number of active profiles present.
  examples:
  - title: Check Active Profile Count
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerGuid)->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      int profileCount = manager->GetActiveProfileNames();\nif (profileCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with behavior-based logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Active profiles:\
      \ %d\", profileCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant function and does not modify the state of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    It is intended for read-only access to profile information and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections due to potential internal iteration
    over profile collections.
