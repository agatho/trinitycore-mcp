  class: BotThreatManager
  method: CalculateBaseThreat
  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateBaseThreat(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the base threat value generated against a specified
    target unit.
  description: The CalculateBaseThreat method computes the initial threat amount that
    a bot generates against a given target unit. This value is typically used in threat
    management systems to determine how much attention a target receives from the
    bot's AI, influencing decisions such as whether to switch targets or maintain
    aggro. The calculation considers various factors including the bot's attack power,
    spell damage, and target attributes. This method does not modify any internal
    state and serves purely as a computational utility for threat assessment within
    the bot's AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated base threat amount. Higher values
    indicate greater threat generation against the target unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "float threat = botThreatManager->CalculateBaseThreat(targetUnit);\nif (threat\
      \ > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Consider switching targets or increasing attack intensity\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat decision-making processes
    where threat values are compared to determine target priority. It may be called
    frequently during combat, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    when implementing custom threat calculations.
