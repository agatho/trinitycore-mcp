    param8)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a jump movement with specified gravity and speed to a target position.
  description: The MoveJumpWithGravity method schedules a character or creature to
    perform a jumping motion toward a given position, using specified horizontal speed
    and vertical gravity parameters. This method is typically used for spell effects
    or AI behaviors that require a jumping animation or movement. The jump can be
    configured with optional arrival cast arguments and spell effect data for advanced
    use cases such as spell targeting or combat mechanics. It integrates with the
    MotionMaster's movement queue and will override any existing movement unless explicitly
    managed.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Target position (x, y, z) where the entity should land after the
      jump.
  - name: speedXY
    description: Horizontal speed of the jump in game units per second. Determines
      how fast the entity moves horizontally during the jump.
  - name: gravity
    description: Vertical gravity applied to the jump, affecting the arc and duration
      of the motion. Higher values result in a steeper descent.
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this movement action, used internally by MotionMaster
      to track or cancel specific jumps.
  - name: facing
    description: Facing direction (in degrees) the entity should face at the start
      of the jump. Negative values may indicate automatic facing behavior.
  - name: orientationFixed
    description: If true, the entity's orientation remains fixed during the jump;
      if false, it may adjust to face the target position.
  - name: arrivalCast
    description: Optional parameters for casting a spell upon arrival at the target
      position. Can be null if no spell is to be cast.
  - name: spellEffectExtraData
    description: Additional data related to the spell effect that triggered this jump,
      such as caster information or targeting details. Can be null.
  - name: param8
    description: Reserved or additional parameter for future use; currently unused
      in standard implementations.
  returns: None. This method performs an action and does not return a value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Jump Movement
    code: 'Position targetPos(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);

      float speed = 10.0f;

      float gravity = 20.0f;

      uint32 jumpId = 1;

      int facing = 0;

      MotionMaster->MoveJumpWithGravity(targetPos, speed, gravity, jumpId, facing,
      true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Jump with Spell Cast on Arrival
    code: 'Position targetPos(150.0f, 300.0f, 75.0f);

      float speed = 15.0f;

      float gravity = 25.0f;

      uint32 jumpId = 2;

      int facing = 90;

      JumpArrivalCastArgs castArgs;

      castArgs.spellId = 45678;

      castArgs.targetGuid = player->GetGUID();

      MotionMaster->MoveJumpWithGravity(targetPos, speed, gravity, jumpId, facing,
      false, &castArgs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MotionMaster's movement system and integrates
    with TrinityCore's pathfinding and animation systems. The jump motion is calculated
    using physics-based interpolation, which means that gravity and speed directly
    influence the trajectory. It is recommended to use unique IDs for each jump to
    avoid conflicts in movement queuing.
  warnings: Improperly setting gravity or speed may cause unrealistic jumps or clipping
    through terrain. Ensure that the target position is valid and reachable before
    calling this method. Using null pointers for arrivalCast or spellEffectExtraData
    is safe, but passing invalid data can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
