  method: GetAngle
  signature: float ObjectPosSelector::GetAngle(const UsedPos & usedPos) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the angular position of a used location within the
    object positioning selector.
  description: The GetAngle method computes the angular position (in radians) of a
    given used position relative to the center of the ObjectPosSelector. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with other positioning logic to determine valid
    spawn angles or directional placements for objects in the game world. The calculation
    considers the current state of occupied positions and ensures that the returned
    angle avoids conflicts with already placed objects. It's commonly utilized during
    object placement routines where angular distribution and collision avoidance are
    critical, such as in creature spawning or loot distribution systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated angle in radians. This angle
    indicates the direction from the center point to the specified used position,
    allowing for proper angular positioning calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Retrieval
    code: 'ObjectPosSelector selector;

      // Assume some positions have been added to selector

      UsedPos pos;

      float angle = selector.GetAngle(pos);

      // Use the angle for further positioning logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of used positions and assumes
    that the ObjectPosSelector has been properly initialized with valid data. The
    returned angle is in radians, not degrees, so any further calculations may require
    conversion using standard mathematical functions.
