documentation:
  brief: Checks if the arena team is currently engaged in a match
  description: The IsFighting method determines whether the arena team is currently
    participating in an active arena match. This method returns true when the team
    is in combat and false when the team is not engaged in any ongoing match. The
    check typically involves verifying the internal state of the arena team to ensure
    it's not in a waiting, idle, or post-match cooldown state. This functionality
    is crucial for preventing actions that should only be allowed during active arena
    battles, such as certain loot distribution or team management operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the arena team is currently fighting in an arena match;
    otherwise returns false if the team is not engaged in any active combat.

  - title: Basic Usage to Check Team Status
    code: "if (arenaTeam->IsFighting()) {\n    // Team is currently in a match\n \
      \   sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_FIGHTING);\n} else {\n    // Team\
      \ is not fighting\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_NOT_FIGHTING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or state variables within the ArenaTeam
    class to determine match status. It's important to note that this check should
    be performed in a thread-safe manner, especially when dealing with concurrent
    access from different game systems.
