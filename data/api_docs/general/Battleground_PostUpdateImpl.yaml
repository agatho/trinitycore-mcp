  class: Battleground
  method: PostUpdateImpl
  signature: void Battleground::PostUpdateImpl(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Performs post-update operations for the battleground after a game tick
  description: The PostUpdateImpl method is an internal implementation detail of the
    Battleground class that handles cleanup and state management tasks after each
    battleground update cycle. This method is typically called by the game loop to
    ensure proper synchronization of player states, objective tracking, and resource
    management within the battleground environment. It may handle tasks such as updating
    player scores, checking win conditions, managing respawn timers, or cleaning up
    temporary data structures that were created during the battleground's active phase.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that likely represents a time delta or update
      cycle identifier used to synchronize operations within the battleground update
      loop
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(1234);\n\
      \    if (bg)\n    {\n        bg->PostUpdateImpl(100); // Update with 100ms delta\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground lifecycle management and
    should not be called directly by external systems. It's designed to work in conjunction
    with other battleground methods and is typically invoked automatically by the
    game engine's update system.
  warnings: Direct invocation of PostUpdateImpl may cause unexpected behavior or state
    corruption if not properly synchronized with the battleground's main update loop.
    This method should only be called from within the context of the battleground's
    own update cycle.
