  method: TriggerSpellCooldown
  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::TriggerSpellCooldown(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers cooldown processing for a specified spell on the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The TriggerSpellCooldown method initiates the cooldown timer for a
    given spell ID on the AI-controlled unit. This method is typically used to manage
    spell usage timing and prevent spells from being cast too frequently. It updates
    internal tracking mechanisms to ensure that the specified spell cannot be cast
    again until its cooldown period has expired. The method operates within the thread-safe
    context of ThreadSafeClassAI, ensuring safe execution in multi-threaded environments
    such as those found in TrinityCore's AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to trigger cooldown.
      This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Trigger cooldown for\
      \ Fireball spell (ID: 133)\n    TriggerSpellCooldown(133);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Cooldown
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Trigger cooldown for a specific spell only if it's\
      \ not already on cooldown\n    if (!me->HasSpellCooldown(133))\n    {\n    \
      \    TriggerSpellCooldown(133);\n        DoCast(me, 133); // Cast the spell\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should be used within AI update
    loops or event handlers. It does not directly cast the spell but rather manages
    its cooldown state, which may affect subsequent casting decisions in the AI logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to an actual spell in the
    database; invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior. This method should not be
    called during spell casting operations as it might interfere with existing cooldown
    management.
