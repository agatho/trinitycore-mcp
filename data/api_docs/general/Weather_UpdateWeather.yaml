documentation:
  brief: Updates the weather state for a zone, including sending updates to players
    and managing weather effects.
  description: The UpdateWeather method is responsible for updating the current weather
    conditions in a specific zone. It handles the logic for transitioning between
    different weather states, applying environmental effects, and notifying connected
    players of weather changes. This method typically gets called periodically by
    the server's game loop or in response to weather change events. The method ensures
    that all active players within the affected zone receive updated weather information
    and that any associated visual or gameplay effects are properly applied or removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the weather update was successfully processed and applied,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an error in processing or
    a failure to update the weather state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weather Update Call
    code: "Weather* weather = sWorld->GetWeatherMap()->GetWeather(4637);\nif (weather)\n\
      {\n    bool success = weather->UpdateWeather();\n    if (success)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Weather updated successfully.\");\n    else\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to update weather.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the server's main game loop or through
    scheduled events. It may perform database operations to persist weather changes
    and should be called with consideration for performance impact in high-player-density
    zones. The method might also trigger additional events or callbacks related to
    weather state changes.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper synchronization or validation
    could lead to inconsistent weather states across different players. Ensure that
    any modifications to weather parameters are properly validated before calling
    this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
