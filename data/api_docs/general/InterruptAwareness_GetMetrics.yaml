  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const DetectionMetrics & InterruptAwareness::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current detection metrics for interrupt awareness.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a constant reference to the DetectionMetrics
    structure that contains various performance and behavioral data related to interrupt
    awareness. This includes information about detection thresholds, success rates,
    and timing metrics used by the AI system to determine when an interrupt should
    be triggered. The returned metrics are read-only and represent the current state
    of the interrupt awareness system at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a DetectionMetrics object containing the current
    interrupt awareness performance data. This includes values such as detection thresholds,
    success rates, timing measurements, and other relevant metrics used by the AI
    system to evaluate interrupt effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const DetectionMetrics& metrics = interruptAwareness.GetMetrics();

      uint32 successRate = metrics.successRate;

      uint32 detectionThreshold = metrics.detectionThreshold;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "InterruptAwareness awareness;\n// ... setup code ...\nconst DetectionMetrics&\
      \ metrics = awareness.GetMetrics();\nif (metrics.successRate > 80)\n{\n    //\
      \ High interrupt success rate\n    sLog->outString(\"High interrupt awareness\
      \ success rate: %u%%\", metrics.successRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned DetectionMetrics reference is valid only until the next call
    to GetMetrics or until the InterruptAwareness object is modified. This method
    is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The metrics are updated
    asynchronously by the AI system based on interrupt events and detection activities.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned DetectionMetrics object as it's a const reference.
    Modifications to the underlying data structure may cause undefined behavior. The
    metrics represent a snapshot in time and may change between calls if the interrupt
    awareness system is actively processing events.
