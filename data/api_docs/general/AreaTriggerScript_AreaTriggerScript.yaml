  class: AreaTriggerScript
  method: AreaTriggerScript
  signature: void AreaTriggerScript::AreaTriggerScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an AreaTriggerScript with a specified name for use in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore.
  description: The AreaTriggerScript constructor initializes a new area trigger script
    instance with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to register and manage area trigger behaviors. The name parameter serves
    as a unique identifier for the script, allowing the game engine to associate specific
    logic with particular area triggers. When an area trigger is activated in the
    world, this script will be invoked to execute custom behavior defined by the developer.
    This constructor sets up the internal state of the script object and prepares
    it for integration into the game's event system.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this area trigger
      script. The name is used by the TrinityCore framework to register and retrieve
      the script when an area trigger is activated. Must be a valid, non-null C-string.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AreaTriggerScript Initialization
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyAreaTriggerScript()\
      \ : AreaTriggerScript(\"my_area_trigger\") {}\n\n    bool OnTrigger(Player*\
      \ player, AreaTriggerEntry const* trigger) override\n    {\n        // Custom\
      \ logic here\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering AreaTriggerScript in a Module
    code: "class MyModule : public Module\n{\npublic:\n    void OnStartup() override\n\
      \    {\n        // Register area trigger script\n        sAreaTriggerMgr->AddAreaTriggerScript(new\
      \ MyAreaTriggerScript());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object initialization. The
    name parameter must be unique across all registered area trigger scripts to prevent
    conflicts. AreaTriggerScript instances are typically managed by the TrinityCore
    framework and should not be manually deleted unless explicitly handled by custom
    memory management code.
  warnings: Do not pass null or empty strings as the name parameter, as this may cause
    registration failures within the TrinityCore system. Ensure that each AreaTriggerScript
    has a unique name to avoid conflicts with other scripts in the same module or
    server instance.
