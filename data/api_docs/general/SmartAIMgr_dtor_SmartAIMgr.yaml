documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SmartAIMgr instance and cleans up associated AI scripts and
    resources.
  description: The SmartAIMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    AI-related data structures and resources managed by this singleton class. It ensures
    that all smart scripts, AI events, and associated memory allocations are freed
    to prevent memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when the SmartAIMgr
    instance goes out of scope or during server shutdown. The destructor performs
    cleanup operations in a safe manner, ensuring no dangling pointers or invalid
    memory accesses occur during the destruction process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void Cleanup()\n{\n    // SmartAIMgr is a singleton, so destruction happens\
      \ automatically\n    // when the server shuts down or the instance is explicitly\
      \ destroyed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the SmartAIMgr singleton pattern. It should not
    be called directly by user code unless implementing custom cleanup logic. The
    cleanup process includes releasing all smart script references and ensuring no
    active AI operations are in progress during destruction.
