  signature: void AchievementMgr::AchievementMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AchievementMgr class for managing player
    achievements in TrinityCore.
  description: The AchievementMgr constructor initializes the achievement management
    system for a player or entity within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets
    up internal data structures and prepares the manager to handle achievement-related
    operations such as tracking progress, checking conditions, and awarding rewards.
    The constructor typically runs during player login or session initialization to
    ensure that all achievement data is properly loaded and ready for use. It may
    also initialize default achievement states and register necessary callbacks for
    achievement events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an AchievementMgr instance
    code: 'AchievementMgr* mgr = new AchievementMgr();

      // The manager is now ready to handle achievement operations

      mgr->LoadPlayerAchievements(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing an AchievementMgr
    instance for a specific player or entity. It's important to ensure that the underlying
    database connection and achievement data are properly initialized before calling
    this constructor. The manager will automatically handle loading of existing achievements
    from the database upon construction.
