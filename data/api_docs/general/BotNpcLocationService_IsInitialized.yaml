  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool BotNpcLocationService::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the BotNpcLocationService has been properly initialized and
    is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the BotNpcLocationService instance
    has completed its initialization process. This service is responsible for managing
    NPC locations and bot-related positioning data within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method typically checks internal flags or state variables that indicate whether
    required resources, configurations, or data structures have been successfully
    loaded and set up. It's commonly used before performing operations that depend
    on the service being fully operational to prevent runtime errors or undefined
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotNpcLocationService is initialized and ready for
    use; otherwise returns false if initialization has not yet occurred or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (botNpcLocationService.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with bot NPC\
      \ location operations\n    std::cout << \"Bot NPC Location Service is ready\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle uninitialized state\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot NPC Location Service not initialized\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any other methods in the BotNpcLocationService
    to ensure proper functionality. The initialization process may involve loading
    configuration files, setting up internal data structures, or registering with
    the core game systems.
