  class: TradeSystem
  method: NavigateToVendor
  signature: bool TradeSystem::NavigateToVendor(Player * player, uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates navigation to a specified vendor for the given player character.
  description: The NavigateToVendor method is responsible for handling the process
    of moving a player character towards a specific vendor within the game world.
    This method typically involves pathfinding calculations, movement updates, and
    potentially triggering related events such as vendor interaction or quest progression.
    It ensures that the player's movement is properly coordinated with the game's
    navigation system and can be used in various trade-related scenarios including
    buying items, selling goods, or interacting with NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character that will
      navigate to the vendor. Must not be null.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor NPC to which the player should
      navigate. This value must correspond to a valid vendor in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if navigation was successfully initiated or completed, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the vendor could not be found,
    the player is already at the vendor location, or movement constraints prevented
    navigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation to Vendor
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object exists\nuint32 vendorGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = TradeSystem::NavigateToVendor(player, vendorGuid);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Player is now navigating to the vendor\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Navigation failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Navigation with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nif (vendorGuid != 0)\
      \ {\n    bool result = TradeSystem::NavigateToVendor(player, vendorGuid);\n\
      \    if (!result) {\n        // Handle navigation failure\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to navigate to vendor.\");\n    }\n} else {\n    // Invalid vendor GUID\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Invalid vendor specified.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore movement system and may
    require the player to be in a valid state for movement. It does not necessarily
    guarantee that the player will reach the vendor, as external factors like combat
    or terrain can interrupt navigation. The implementation may also involve asynchronous
    behavior depending on how the game handles pathfinding.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendorGuid parameter corresponds to an actual NPC in the
    database; otherwise, the method will likely fail. Also, calling this method while
    the player is already engaged in combat or other movement-restricting activities
    may result in unexpected behavior or failure.
