  class: EchoController
  method: CalculateEchoValue
  signature: int EchoController::CalculateEchoValue(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns an echo value based on the provided target pointer.
  description: The CalculateEchoValue method performs a calculation using the integer
    pointed to by the target parameter and returns the resulting echo value. This
    method is typically used in game mechanics where a calculated response or reflection
    value is needed, such as in spell effects, aura calculations, or environmental
    interactions. The method does not modify the input value but uses it as a basis
    for computation. It is a const method, indicating that it does not alter the state
    of the EchoController object.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer value used as input for echo calculation.
      The pointed-to value is read but not modified during execution.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated echo value derived from
    the target parameter. The specific calculation logic is internal to the implementation
    and may vary based on game mechanics or configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int inputValue = 42;

      int result = controller.CalculateEchoValue(&inputValue);

      // result contains the echo value calculated from inputValue'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Game Context
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int spellPower = player->GetSpellPower();

      int echoValue = controller.CalculateEchoValue(&spellPower);

      // Use echoValue for spell effect calculations or modifiers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as const, meaning it does not modify any member variables
    of the EchoController class. The calculation performed internally may involve
    complex game logic or configuration-dependent values that are not exposed in this
    interface.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to a properly initialized integer value. Passing a null pointer will result in
    undefined behavior and likely crash the application.
