  brief: Manages threat distribution and tank coordination within a group during combat
    encounters
  description: The HandleTankThreatManagement method is responsible for coordinating
    threat levels among group members during combat scenarios. It ensures that the
    designated tank maintains appropriate threat levels to keep mobs focused on them,
    while also managing threat transfer and mitigation between group members. This
    method typically handles the logic for when to switch threat targets, how to distribute
    threat properly, and whether to use specific mechanics like taunts or threat reduction
    abilities. The method operates within the context of group-based encounters where
    proper threat management is crucial for successful raid or dungeon completion.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Scenario
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_isInCombat)\n    \
      \    m_groupCoordination->HandleTankThreatManagement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's threat table and may trigger
    events or send packets to update client-side threat displays. It should be called
    regularly during combat encounters, typically at a fixed interval (e.g., every
    100-200ms). The implementation may vary based on encounter type and difficulty
    level.
  warnings: Improper threat management can lead to mobs attacking the wrong targets,
    potentially causing wipes in group content. This method should not be called outside
    of combat scenarios as it may cause unexpected behavior or performance issues.
