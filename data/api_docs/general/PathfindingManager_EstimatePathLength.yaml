  signature: float PathfindingManager::EstimatePathLength(const int & start, const
    int & goal)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the path length between two nodes in the navigation mesh using
    heuristic distance calculation.
  description: The EstimatePathLength method calculates an estimated straight-line
    distance between two points (represented as node IDs) within the game's navigation
    mesh. This estimation is typically used by pathfinding algorithms like A* to prioritize
    which nodes to explore next during route computation. The method does not compute
    the actual path, but rather provides a heuristic cost estimate that helps optimize
    search performance. It assumes both start and goal nodes are valid and exist within
    the current navigation data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The node ID representing the starting position in the navigation
      mesh. Must be a valid node identifier present in the current pathfinding grid.
  - name: goal
    description: The node ID representing the target destination in the navigation
      mesh. Must be a valid node identifier present in the current pathfinding grid.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated straight-line distance between
    the start and goal nodes. Returns zero if either node is invalid or if the nodes
    are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to estimate path length
    code: "float estimatedLength = pathfinder->EstimatePathLength(1001, 2005);\nif\
      \ (estimatedLength > 0.0f)\n{\n    printf(\"Estimated path length: %.2f\\n\"\
      , estimatedLength);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using estimate for pathfinding optimization
    code: 'int startNode = GetPlayerNodeID(player);

      int targetNode = GetTargetNodeID(target);

      float heuristic = pathfinder->EstimatePathLength(startNode, targetNode);

      // Use heuristic value in A* f-score calculation

      float fScore = gCost + heuristic;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple Euclidean distance calculation between two
    points without considering obstacles or actual walkable paths. It's designed for
    fast computation and serves as a heuristic in pathfinding algorithms. The method
    relies on precomputed node coordinates stored within the PathfindingManager instance.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid node IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect estimates. Ensure that both start and goal parameters refer to valid
    nodes present in the current navigation mesh before calling this function.
