documentation:
  brief: Checks whether corpse prevention functionality is currently enabled in the
    server.
  description: The IsEnabled method returns a boolean value indicating if the corpse
    prevention system is active. This system prevents players from leaving corpses
    behind when they die, which can be useful for preventing loot exploitation or
    maintaining game balance in certain scenarios. The method typically checks internal
    configuration flags or server settings to determine the current state of the corpse
    prevention mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if corpse prevention is enabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (CorpsePreventionManager::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Corpse prevention is\
      \ active\n    sLog->outString(\"Corpse prevention is enabled.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Corpse prevention is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Corpse prevention\
      \ is disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple boolean check against an internal flag
    rather than complex logic. It's designed to be fast and efficient as it may be
    called frequently during player death events.
