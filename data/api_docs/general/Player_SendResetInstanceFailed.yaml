  signature: void Player::SendResetInstanceFailed(int reason, uint32 mapID) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a reset instance failure message to the player, indicating that the
    dungeon cannot be reset due to a specific reason.
  description: This method sends a message to the player's client indicating that
    a dungeon instance cannot be reset. The method is typically used when a player
    attempts to reset a dungeon but fails due to various reasons such as players being
    present in the instance, or other game mechanics constraints. It allows the player
    to understand why the reset failed and provides feedback for proper game progression.
    This method is part of the TrinityCore's player communication system and is essential
    for maintaining proper game state and player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: 'The reason code indicating why the instance reset failed. Possible
      values include: 0 (no reason specified), 1 (player present in instance), 2 (player
      not meeting requirements), 3 (other game mechanics).'
  - name: mapID
    description: The map ID of the dungeon that failed to reset. This represents the
      specific dungeon or instance that the player attempted to reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendResetInstanceFailed(1, 123);

      // This sends a message indicating that the instance with map ID 123 failed
      to reset due to players being present in it.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 mapID = 456;

      int reason = 2;

      player->SendResetInstanceFailed(reason, mapID);

      // This sends a message indicating that the instance with map ID 456 failed
      to reset due to player not meeting requirements.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore when a player attempts
    to reset an instance but fails. It's important to note that this method does not
    actually reset the instance itself; it simply sends a message to the player's
    client indicating that the reset failed. The method is part of the player communication
    system and should be used carefully to avoid sending incorrect messages to players.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player attempts to reset an instance
    but fails due to specific reasons. Using this method incorrectly can lead to confusing
    game state for players, potentially causing them to believe they are in a dungeon
    that is not actually reset. It's also important to note that this method does
    not actually reset the instance; it only sends a message.
