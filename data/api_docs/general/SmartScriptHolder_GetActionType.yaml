  class: SmartScriptHolder
  method: GetActionType
  signature: uint32 SmartScriptHolder::GetActionType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the action type identifier associated with this smart script holder.
  description: The GetActionType method returns the unique identifier representing
    the type of action that this SmartScriptHolder is configured to execute. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AI system, this value corresponds to predefined action
    types used by the SmartAI framework to determine which behavior or action should
    be performed when a script condition is met. The returned value typically maps
    to an enumeration or constant defined within the SmartAI subsystem, allowing for
    dynamic execution of different scripted actions based on the context and configuration
    of the AI entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the action type identifier. This value corresponds
    to a predefined action type in the SmartAI system, such as ACTION_TYPE_TALK, ACTION_TYPE_CAST,
    or similar constants used internally by the framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = ...;\nuint32 actionType = holder->GetActionType();\n\
      if (actionType == ACTION_TYPE_TALK)\n{\n    // Handle talking action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Action Type Validation
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = ...;\nuint32 actionType = holder->GetActionType();\n\
      switch (actionType)\n{\n    case ACTION_TYPE_CAST:\n        // Process cast\
      \ action\n        break;\n    case ACTION_TYPE_MOVE:\n        // Process movement\
      \ action\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown action type\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other SmartScriptHolder
    methods to build complete AI behavior logic. The returned action type value should
    be validated against known constants or enums before use to ensure compatibility
    with the current SmartAI implementation.
