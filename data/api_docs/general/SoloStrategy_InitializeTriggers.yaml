documentation:
  brief: Initializes the trigger list for the solo AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all the triggers
    that govern the behavior of the SoloStrategy AI. This method is typically called
    during the initialization phase of an AI system to establish the conditions under
    which certain actions should be executed. It ensures that the AI has a complete
    set of rules and events to respond to, based on the solo gameplay context. The
    method does not take any parameters and does not return a value, as it solely
    performs setup operations for the trigger system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'SoloStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's initialization phase.
    Reinitializing triggers may lead to duplicate or conflicting behavior rules within
    the AI system.
