  class: QuestRewardItem
  method: QuestRewardItem
  signature: void QuestRewardItem::QuestRewardItem(uint32 id, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a quest reward item with the specified ID and count.
  description: The QuestRewardItem constructor initializes a quest reward item object
    with the provided unique identifier and quantity. This method is typically used
    within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to define items
    that are rewarded to players upon completing quests. The initialization process
    sets up internal state variables for the item, including its database ID and the
    number of units to be awarded. This constructor is part of the quest reward system
    and is usually called during quest processing when rewards are being prepared
    for player delivery.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the item to be rewarded. This corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's database, typically matching the item_template
      table's entry field.
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of the specified item to be awarded as a quest reward.
      Must be a positive integer value representing how many units of the item the
      player will receive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Item Initialization
    code: 'QuestRewardItem rewardItem(12345, 2);

      // Creates a quest reward item for item ID 12345 with a count of 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Quest Reward Items
    code: 'std::vector<QuestRewardItem> rewards;

      rewards.emplace_back(12345, 1);

      rewards.emplace_back(67890, 3);

      rewards.emplace_back(54321, 10);

      // Initializes multiple quest reward items with different IDs and counts'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal quest reward system in TrinityCore.
    The item ID must correspond to a valid entry in the game's database; otherwise,
    the reward may not be properly handled during quest completion. The count parameter
    should be validated before calling this constructor to ensure it represents a
    meaningful quantity for the player's inventory.
  warnings: Using invalid item IDs (non-existent entries in the database) can lead
    to undefined behavior or missing rewards. Ensure that all item IDs passed to this
    constructor are valid and exist in the game's item_template table. Also, be cautious
    with very large count values as they may exceed inventory limits or cause performance
    issues.
