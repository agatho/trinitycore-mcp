  method: CompactMemory
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::CompactMemory()
documentation:
  brief: Reclaims unused memory from the bot's AI system to optimize performance and
    reduce memory footprint.
  description: The CompactMemory method is designed to reclaim unused or fragmented
    memory within the EnhancedBotAI system. This function helps maintain optimal performance
    by cleaning up internal data structures that may have accumulated over time due
    to dynamic allocations, such as those used for storing bot behavior states, action
    queues, or temporary AI calculations. It ensures efficient memory usage and prevents
    potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption in long-running bot instances.
    The method typically operates during idle periods or when the AI system detects
    a need for memory optimization.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Compaction
    code: "void MyBot::OnUpdate()\n{\n    // Perform bot logic\n    // ...\n    \n\
      \    // Compact memory periodically to maintain performance\n    if (m_botAI)\n\
      \        m_botAI->CompactMemory();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may involve internal data structure
    reorganization which could temporarily impact AI responsiveness. It's recommended
    to call this function during low-activity periods or when the bot is not actively
    executing complex behaviors.
