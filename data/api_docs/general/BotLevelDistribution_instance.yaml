documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotLevelDistribution class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotLevelDistribution
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This class is likely responsible for managing and distributing bot
    levels within the TrinityCore environment, potentially handling level scaling,
    distribution algorithms, or configuration settings related to AI bot character
    progression. The method performs a thread-safe retrieval of the singleton instance,
    making it suitable for use across multiple threads without requiring additional
    synchronization mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotLevelDistribution instance. The returned pointer
    is never null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution* distribution = BotLevelDistribution::instance();

      // Use the distribution object for bot level calculations

      int level = distribution->GetRandomLevel();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Configuration
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution* instance = BotLevelDistribution::instance();

      uint32 minLevel = instance->GetMinimumBotLevel();

      uint32 maxLevel = instance->GetMaximumBotLevel();

      // Configure bot behavior based on level distribution settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the singleton pattern which means that all calls to instance()
    will return the same object reference. The implementation should be thread-safe
    as it's likely used across multiple threads in a server environment. Developers
    should be aware that modifying the singleton state affects all parts of the application
    that use it.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances manually
    or relying on global state changes. Changes to the singleton instance affect the
    entire system, so modifications should be carefully considered and tested.
