  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: OptimizeGroupRoles
  signature: OptimizationResult RoleOptimizer::OptimizeGroupRoles(Group * group, OptimizationGoal
    goal, const OptimizationConstraints & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes group roles for a given group based on specified goal and constraints.
  description: The OptimizeGroupRoles method analyzes the current composition of a
    World of Warcraft group and determines the optimal distribution of roles (such
    as tank, healer, damage dealer) to maximize performance according to the specified
    optimization goal. This method considers player class, specialization, gear, and
    other relevant factors to suggest role assignments that improve group efficiency.
    It is typically used in raid and dungeon environments where proper role distribution
    significantly impacts success rates. The method requires a valid group object
    and appropriate constraints to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that needs role optimization. Must be
      a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: goal
    description: Enumeration value specifying the optimization goal (e.g., maximizing
      DPS, ensuring tank/healer availability).
  - name: constraints
    description: Structure containing optimization constraints such as minimum required
      roles, class restrictions, or performance thresholds.
  returns: Returns an OptimizationResult object that contains the outcome of the optimization
    process. The result includes details about which players were assigned to which
    roles and whether the optimization was successful.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Role Optimization
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nOptimizationGoal\
      \ goal = OPTIMIZE_FOR_DPS;\nOptimizationConstraints constraints;\nconstraints.minTanks\
      \ = 1;\nconstraints.minHealers = 1;\nOptimizationResult result = roleOptimizer->OptimizeGroupRoles(myGroup,\
      \ goal, constraints);\nif (result.success)\n{\n    // Process optimized roles\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in raid environments where group
    composition and role distribution are critical. It may have performance implications
    when processing large groups or frequent calls, so it should be used judiciously.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Improper handling of group members or constraints can lead to incorrect
    optimization results.
