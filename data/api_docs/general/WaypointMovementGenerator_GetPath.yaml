  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: GetPath
  signature: const int * WaypointMovementGenerator::GetPath() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the internal waypoint path array for this movement generator
  description: The GetPath method provides access to the underlying integer array
    that represents the sequence of waypoints this movement generator will follow.
    This array typically contains identifiers or indices that correspond to specific
    locations in the game world's navigation system. The returned pointer points to
    a const int array, ensuring that external code cannot modify the internal waypoint
    data directly. This method is commonly used by AI systems and movement controllers
    to inspect or analyze the path that a creature or NPC will traverse.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array representing the waypoint path.
    The array contains sequential waypoint identifiers or indices that define the
    movement route. Returns nullptr if no path has been set or initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Waypoint Path for Debugging
    code: "WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = ...;\nconst int* path = wpGen->GetPath();\n\
      if (path != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) // Assuming max 10\
      \ waypoints\n    {\n        if (path[i] == -1) break; // End of path marker\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Waypoint: \" << path[i] << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is only valid while the WaypointMovementGenerator instance
    remains alive and has not been modified. The array elements are typically indices
    into a global waypoint database or navigation mesh. This method does not perform
    any copying of data, so the returned pointer should be used immediately to avoid
    dangling references.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the data pointed to by the returned pointer as
    it is const. Accessing the path after the movement generator has been destroyed
    results in undefined behavior. The array may contain -1 or other sentinel values
    indicating end-of-path or invalid waypoints.
