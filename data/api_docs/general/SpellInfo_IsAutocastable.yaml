  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsAutocastable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell is automatically castable without user interaction.
  description: The IsAutocastable method checks if a spell can be automatically triggered
    or cast without requiring player input. This is typically used for spells that
    have automatic casting behavior, such as certain abilities or passive effects.
    The method returns true when the spell is marked as autocastable, indicating that
    it can be activated without manual intervention. This functionality is important
    for game mechanics involving automated spell activation and AI behavior in World
    of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is automatically castable, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the spell can be triggered without user interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAutocastable()) {\n    // Spell can be auto-cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal spell flags or
    properties that determine if a spell has automatic casting behavior. Performance
    considerations: No significant overhead as this is a simple boolean check.'
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine whether a spell can be cast
    manually, as it only indicates auto-castability, not general castability.
