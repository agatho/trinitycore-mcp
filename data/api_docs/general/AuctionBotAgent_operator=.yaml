documentation:
  brief: Moves an AuctionBotAgent object to another, transferring ownership of resources.
  description: The move assignment operator for AuctionBotAgent transfers all resources
    from the source object to the current object. This operation is typically used
    when moving objects in containers or when returning objects from functions. The
    source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move. In the
    context of TrinityCore's auction house system, this method allows efficient transfer
    of auction bot agent data and state without unnecessary copying.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current AuctionBotAgent object after the move operation
    has completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionBotAgent agent1;

      AuctionBotAgent agent2 = std::move(agent1); // Uses move assignment

      // agent1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container
    code: 'std::vector<AuctionBotAgent> agents;

      agents.emplace_back();

      agents.push_back(std::move(agents.front())); // Move the first agent to end

      // First agent is now in moved-from state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It should
    only be called on rvalue references or explicitly moved objects. The moved-from
    object must not be used afterward except to destroy it or assign to it again.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that objects are properly initialized after move operations,
    and avoid using moved-from objects in any context other than destruction or reassignment.
