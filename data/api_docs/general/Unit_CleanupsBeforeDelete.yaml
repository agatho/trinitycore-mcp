  brief: Cleans up all references and resources before deleting a Unit object
  description: The CleanupsBeforeDelete method performs necessary cleanup operations
    on a Unit object before it is destroyed, ensuring that all references to the unit
    are properly removed from the game world. This method handles memory management
    and prevents dangling pointers by clearing any references to the unit in various
    systems such as AI, threat lists, and other subsystems. It is typically called
    during the destruction process of a Unit object to maintain game stability and
    prevent memory leaks.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->CleanupsBeforeDelete(true);

      delete unit;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any Unit object is deleted to prevent
    memory corruption and ensure proper cleanup of references. It's typically invoked
    automatically during destruction process.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory leaks or dangling pointer
    errors if not properly handled during unit deletion.
