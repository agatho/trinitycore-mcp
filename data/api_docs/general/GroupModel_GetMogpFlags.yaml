  class: GroupModel
  method: GetMogpFlags
  signature: uint32 GroupModel::GetMogpFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the MOGP flags associated with the group model.
  description: The GetMogpFlags method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the MOGP (Model Group) flags for the current GroupModel instance. These flags
    typically define various properties and behaviors of the model group, such as
    visibility settings, collision properties, or rendering options. The returned
    value is often used internally by the TrinityCore engine to determine how the
    group model should be processed during map loading and client rendering. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the MOGP flags of the GroupModel. Each bit
    in the returned value may correspond to a specific flag or property, such as whether
    the model group has collision data, should be rendered, or affects terrain lighting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupModel* model = ...;\nuint32 flags = model->GetMogpFlags();\nif (flags\
      \ & 0x1)\n{\n    // Handle case where model group has specific flag set\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Model Flags
    code: 'GroupModel* model = ...;

      uint32 flags = model->GetMogpFlags();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("maps", "MOGP Flags for group model: 0x%08X", flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in map loading and rendering logic within TrinityCore.
    The exact meaning of each bit in the returned flag value depends on the specific
    implementation and version of the game client and server. Developers should consult
    the relevant documentation or source code for detailed flag definitions.
