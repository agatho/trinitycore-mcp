  brief: Initializes the player bot module during server startup
  description: The OnModuleStartup method is called when the player bot module is
    initialized during the TrinityCore server startup process. This method performs
    essential setup operations such as registering event handlers, initializing internal
    data structures, and preparing the module for operation. It ensures that all necessary
    resources are allocated and configured before the module begins processing player
    bot commands and behaviors. The method is typically invoked once per server instance
    and should not be called manually by other components.

  - title: Module startup initialization
    code: "class MyPlayerBotModule : public PlayerbotModuleAdapter\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   void OnModuleStartup() override\n    {\n        // Initialize module resources\n\
      \        LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"MyPlayerBotModule initialized\");\n     \
      \   // Register event handlers\n        // Setup internal data structures\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked by the TrinityCore framework during
    server initialization. Developers should avoid calling this method directly unless
    implementing custom module loading logic. The method should complete its operations
    quickly to prevent blocking server startup.
