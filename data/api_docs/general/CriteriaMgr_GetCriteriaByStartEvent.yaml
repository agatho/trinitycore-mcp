  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: GetCriteriaByStartEvent
  signature: const CriteriaList * CriteriaMgr::GetCriteriaByStartEvent(int startEvent,
    int32 asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria associated with a specific start event and asset.
  description: The GetCriteriaByStartEvent method fetches a const pointer to a CriteriaList
    that contains all criteria entries linked to a given start event ID and optional
    asset ID. This functionality is typically used within the context of achievement
    or quest systems where certain criteria must be met upon triggering an event.
    The method allows for efficient lookup of criteria based on event triggers, which
    is essential for dynamic reward assignment and progress tracking in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework. It returns a null pointer if no criteria are found for
    the specified event and asset combination.
  parameters:
  - name: startEvent
    description: The unique identifier of the start event that triggers the criteria.
      This value corresponds to an event type defined in the game's event system.
  - name: asset
    description: An optional asset ID that further refines the criteria lookup. If
      set to -1 or 0, it may match all assets for the given start event.
  returns: A const pointer to a CriteriaList containing all matching criteria entries
    for the specified start event and asset. Returns nullptr if no matching criteria
    are found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const CriteriaList* criteria = criteriaMgr->GetCriteriaByStartEvent(12345,\
      \ 67890);\nif (criteria)\n{\n    // Process the list of criteria\n    for (auto&\
      \ criterion : *criteria)\n    {\n        // Handle each criterion\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for null return before processing
    code: "const CriteriaList* criteria = criteriaMgr->GetCriteriaByStartEvent(12345,\
      \ -1);\nif (!criteria)\n{\n    // No criteria found for this event\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with handling the criteria list\nfor (const auto& criterion :\
      \ *criteria)\n{\n    // Handle each criterion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and should not cause performance
    issues when used correctly. It relies on internal data structures that are populated
    during server initialization or loading phases. The CriteriaList returned is read-only
    and must not be modified directly.
  warnings: Ensure that the startEvent parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    event in the game's system; otherwise, the method will return nullptr. Also, be
    cautious when using negative asset values as they might have special meanings
    depending on how the criteria are defined in the database.
