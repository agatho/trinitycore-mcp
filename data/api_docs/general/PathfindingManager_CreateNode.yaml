  class: PathfindingManager
  method: CreateNode
  signature: PathNode * PathfindingManager::CreateNode(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new pathfinding node at the specified position.
  description: The CreateNode method instantiates a new PathNode object within the
    pathfinding system, typically used during navigation graph construction or dynamic
    path updates. This method allocates memory for the node and initializes its properties
    based on the provided position parameter. The returned node can then be used in
    pathfinding algorithms to represent waypoints or connection points in the game
    world's navigation mesh. It is commonly invoked when building or modifying the
    AI navigation system, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic obstacles or
    terrain changes that require new nodes to be inserted into the existing pathfinding
    graph.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate where the new node should be created. This
      parameter typically represents a location in the game world's coordinate system,
      often used as an index or identifier for node placement within the pathfinding
      grid or graph structure.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created PathNode object. Returns NULL if memory
    allocation fails or if the position parameter is invalid, indicating that the
    node could not be successfully created.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Node Creation
    code: "PathNode* newNode = pathfindingManager->CreateNode(12345);\nif (newNode\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Successfully created a new node\n    // Use the node\
      \ in pathfinding operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Node Creation
    code: "int position = 67890;\nPathNode* node = pathfindingManager->CreateNode(position);\n\
      if (node == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle failure case - log error or retry\n \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Failed to create path node at position %d\", position);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with node usage\n    node->SetFlag(PATH_NODE_FLAG_TEMPORARY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core pathfinding infrastructure and should be
    used carefully to avoid memory leaks or invalid node references. The position
    parameter is critical for proper node placement within the navigation graph, and
    invalid positions may lead to undefined behavior. Consider thread safety when
    calling this method from concurrent AI systems.
  warnings: Calling CreateNode with an invalid or out-of-bounds position value may
    result in corrupted pathfinding data structures. Always validate input parameters
    before invoking this method, especially in dynamic environments where node positions
    change frequently. Failure to properly manage returned node pointers can lead
    to memory leaks or dangling pointer issues.
