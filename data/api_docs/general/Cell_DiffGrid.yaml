documentation:
  brief: Compares two Cell objects to determine if their grid coordinates differ.
  description: The DiffGrid method checks whether the grid position (x, y) of the
    current Cell object differs from that of another Cell object. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage spatial partitioning and determine
    if entities have moved between different grid cells. The comparison is based on
    the internal grid coordinates stored within each Cell instance. This method does
    not consider the cell's content or objects, only its position in the world grid
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the grid coordinates of the current Cell differ from those
    of the provided Cell object; otherwise returns false. If both cells are at the
    same grid position, the method returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Grid Difference Check
    code: 'Cell cell1(10, 15);

      Cell cell2(10, 16);

      bool diff = cell1.DiffGrid(cell2); // Returns true because grid coordinates
      differ'
    language: cpp
  - title: Same Grid Position Check
    code: 'Cell cellA(5, 5);

      Cell cellB(5, 5);

      bool same = cellA.DiffGrid(cellB); // Returns false because grid coordinates
      are identical'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's grid management
    system. It assumes that both Cell objects have valid grid coordinates and does
    not perform bounds checking on the input parameters. Performance is generally
    fast as it only compares integer coordinates.
