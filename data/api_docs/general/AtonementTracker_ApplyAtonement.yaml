  class: AtonementTracker
  method: ApplyAtonement
  signature: void AtonementTracker::ApplyAtonement(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies atonement effect to a player with specified GUID for a given duration.
  description: The ApplyAtonement method is used to activate or apply an atonement
    effect to a player identified by their global unique identifier (GUID). This effect
    typically lasts for the specified duration in milliseconds. The method likely
    interacts with the player's aura system and may modify their combat state, healing
    effectiveness, or other gameplay mechanics related to atonement. It is designed
    to be called during gameplay events such as spell casting, ability usage, or status
    changes that require the application of atonement effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to apply atonement
      to. This value uniquely identifies the target player within the game world and
      is typically obtained from player objects or related entities.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the atonement effect should
      remain active. This parameter controls how long the atonement state persists
      on the target player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AtonementTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyAtonement(12345, 5000); // Apply atonement to player with GUID
      12345 for 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Object
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get reference to player

      AtonementTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyAtonement(targetPlayer->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 3000); // Apply
      for 3 seconds using player''s GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state or aura tracking systems.
    It should only be called when the target player is valid and within the game world.
    The atonement effect may stack with existing effects or overwrite previous ones
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID (e.g., zero or non-existent player)
    could result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target player exists
    and is valid before calling this method.
