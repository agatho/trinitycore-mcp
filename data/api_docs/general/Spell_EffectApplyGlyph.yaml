  brief: Applies a glyph to the player's spellbook, enabling enhanced spell effects.
  description: The EffectApplyGlyph method is responsible for applying a glyph to
    the player's spellbook, which modifies the behavior of spells by adding additional
    effects or altering their properties. This method typically occurs during spell
    activation or when a player gains access to a new glyph through leveling up or
    quest completion. It involves updating the spell's effect parameters and potentially
    modifying the spell's visual representation in the game client. The method is
    part of the broader spell handling system within TrinityCore, where glyphs are
    used to enhance spell capabilities and provide additional functionality.

    code: "void Spell::EffectApplyGlyph() {\n    // Implementation details\n    //\
      \ Apply glyph effect to spell\n    // Update spell parameters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell activation or when a player
    receives a new glyph. It requires careful handling of spell effects and may involve
    updating the spell's visual representation in the client. Performance considerations
    include potential impact on spell processing time, especially for complex spells
    with multiple effects.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by external code unless explicitly
    required by game mechanics. Incorrect application of glyphs can lead to unexpected
    behavior or spell failure. Ensure that glyph application aligns with player's
    level requirements and spell restrictions.
