  method: LoadAuctions
  signature: void AuctionHouseMgr::LoadAuctions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all auction house entries from the database into memory for active
    auctions.
  description: The LoadAuctions method initializes and populates the in-memory auction
    data structure by retrieving all active auction records from the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when the auction house system
    needs to be refreshed with current auction data. It processes each auction entry,
    validates its state, and prepares it for player interaction within the auction
    house interface. The method ensures that only valid, unexpired auctions are loaded
    into the system's memory cache.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAuctionHouse()\n{\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->LoadAuctions();\n\
      \    // Auctions are now loaded and ready for player interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete refresh of auction data is required. It performs database queries that
    may impact performance if called frequently. The loaded auctions are stored in
    an internal cache and will be automatically cleaned up when expired.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate auction entries in memory. This method blocks execution until all database
    records are retrieved and processed, so it should not be called from time-critical
    code paths.
