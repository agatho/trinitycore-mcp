documentation:
  brief: Sends a group destroy update to the specified player.
  description: The SendUpdateDestroyGroupToPlayer method is responsible for notifying
    a specific player that their group has been destroyed or disbanded. This method
    is typically called internally by the Group system when a group is being removed
    from the game state, ensuring that the player's client is properly updated to
    reflect the change. The update includes removing the group information from the
    player's UI and clearing any related group data on the client side. This method
    does not modify the group object itself but rather sends a network message to
    the specified player.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in group disbanding
    code: "void Group::Disband()\n{\n    // ... other disband logic ...\n    for (auto\
      \ const& member : GetMembers())\n    {\n        SendUpdateDestroyGroupToPlayer(member->GetPlayer());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group management system and should not
    typically be called directly by external code. It's designed to work in conjunction
    with other group-related methods to maintain synchronization between server state
    and client UI.
