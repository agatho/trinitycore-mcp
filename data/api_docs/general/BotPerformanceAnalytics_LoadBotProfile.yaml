  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: LoadBotProfile
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::LoadBotProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes performance analytics data for a specified bot using
    its unique identifier.
  description: The LoadBotProfile method retrieves and prepares performance analytics
    data for a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically
    invoked when a bot is initialized or when performance metrics need to be accessed
    for analysis. It ensures that all relevant profiling information associated with
    the given bot GUID is loaded into memory, enabling subsequent performance tracking
    operations. The method likely interacts with internal databases or caches to fetch
    profile data and may perform validation checks on the provided GUID before proceeding.
    This functionality supports the broader bot management system by providing access
    to historical performance data for analysis and optimization purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose profile data needs
      to be loaded. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.LoadBotProfile(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nuint32_t botId = 67890;\nif (botId\
      \ > 0) {\n    analytics.LoadBotProfile(botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system and
    may cache loaded profiles to improve efficiency. It should be called before attempting
    to access any bot-specific performance metrics.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an actual existing bot
    in the database, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Calling this method with
    invalid GUIDs might result in runtime errors or data corruption.
