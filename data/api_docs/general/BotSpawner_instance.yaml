documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotSpawner class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotSpawner
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the bot spawner exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot
    spawning functionality within the TrinityCore server environment. The returned
    pointer provides access to all bot-related spawning and management operations.
    This implementation follows standard singleton conventions where the first call
    creates the instance, and subsequent calls return the same instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotSpawner instance. Returns a valid pointer to
    the singleton instance; in normal operation this should never be null unless there's
    a critical initialization failure or memory corruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotSpawner* spawner = BotSpawner::instance();\nif (spawner)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the bot spawner instance\n    spawner->SpawnBots();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Bot Spawning Functions
    code: "BotSpawner* spawner = BotSpawner::instance();\nif (spawner && spawner->IsEnabled())\n\
      {\n    // Spawn bots in current map\n    spawner->SpawnBotsForMap(someMapId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most implementations as it typically uses static
    local variables or atomic operations for instance creation. The singleton instance
    is created on first access, making it lazy-initialized. Developers should be aware
    that modifying the singleton state affects all parts of the application that use
    it.
  warnings: Avoid storing references to the singleton instance across different server
    contexts or sessions as this may lead to undefined behavior. Be cautious when
    unit testing code that depends on this singleton, as test isolation might be compromised.
