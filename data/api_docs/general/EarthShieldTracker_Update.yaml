  class: EarthShieldTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void EarthShieldTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Earth Shield tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in the EarthShieldTracker class is responsible for
    refreshing and maintaining the current state of Earth Shield effects applied to
    a player bot. This method typically checks the player's active buffs, updates
    internal tracking data structures, and ensures that any necessary adjustments
    are made to the shield's duration or effectiveness based on game mechanics. It
    may also handle cleanup of expired shields or synchronization with the player's
    current combat state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Earth Shield
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: None. This method performs in-place updates and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EarthShieldTracker::Update
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      EarthShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during bot AI updates to maintain
    accurate tracking of Earth Shield status. The implementation likely involves checking
    the player's aura list for Earth Shield buffs and updating internal timers or
    counters accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies
    internal state and should only be called from within a controlled AI update loop.
