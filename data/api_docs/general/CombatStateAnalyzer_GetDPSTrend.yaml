documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage per second trend value for the combat state.
  description: The GetDPSTrend method computes a floating-point value representing
    the trend of damage per second (DPS) over a specified time window within the current
    combat state. This value indicates whether the DPS is increasing, decreasing,
    or remaining stable. The method typically analyzes recent damage events and their
    timing to determine this trend, which can be useful for performance analysis,
    combat log evaluation, or in-game metrics tracking. It operates on data collected
    during active combat sessions and may return a meaningful value only when sufficient
    combat data exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the DPS trend. Positive values indicate increasing
    DPS, negative values indicate decreasing DPS, and values near zero suggest stable
    DPS. The exact scale or interpretation of the magnitude depends on internal implementation
    details of the CombatStateAnalyzer class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float dpsTrend = combatAnalyzer.GetDPSTrend();\nif (dpsTrend > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"DPS is increasing\\n\");\n}\nelse if (dpsTrend < 0.0f)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"DPS is decreasing\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"DPS is stable\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on recent combat event data and may return inaccurate
    or undefined results if called during periods of minimal or no combat activity.
    The internal calculation logic might involve smoothing algorithms or averaging
    over a fixed time window to provide a more stable trend indicator.
  warnings: Calling this method immediately after entering combat without sufficient
    damage events may result in misleading or zero-based trend values. Ensure that
    the combat state has accumulated meaningful damage data before relying on the
    returned value for decision-making.
