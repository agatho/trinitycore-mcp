documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one CombatEventBus object to another, performing
    a deep copy of all event handlers and associated data.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the CombatEventBus
    class. It performs a deep copy of all internal event handlers, subscriptions,
    and associated data from the source CombatEventBus object to the target object.
    This ensures that after assignment, both objects maintain independent copies of
    their event handling mechanisms. The method properly handles reference counting
    and cleanup of existing resources before copying new ones. In the context of TrinityCore's
    combat system, this allows for flexible reassignment of combat event handlers
    while maintaining proper memory management and preventing resource leaks.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source CombatEventBus object whose contents will be copied to
      this object. This parameter must be a valid, initialized CombatEventBus instance.
  returns: A reference to the current CombatEventBus object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed. This enables method chaining for consecutive assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'CombatEventBus bus1;

      CombatEventBus bus2;

      // ... setup bus1 with event handlers ...

      bus2 = bus1; // Assigns all event handlers from bus1 to bus2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining Example
    code: 'CombatEventBus bus1, bus2, bus3;

      // ... setup event handlers ...

      bus1 = bus2 = bus3; // Chained assignment - all buses get the same handlers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large numbers of event handlers. The implementation should properly
    handle reference counting to prevent memory leaks. When assigning to an already
    initialized CombatEventBus, existing event handlers are properly cleaned up before
    new ones are copied.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large CombatEventBus objects as the deep copy
    operation may be expensive. Ensure that no circular references exist between event
    handlers that could cause issues during cleanup. The assignment operator does
    not guarantee thread safety, so synchronization should be handled by the caller
    if used in multi-threaded contexts.
