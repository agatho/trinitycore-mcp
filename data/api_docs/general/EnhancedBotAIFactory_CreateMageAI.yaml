  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateMageAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Mage AI instance for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateMageAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a Mage-specific artificial intelligence behavior for a given bot player within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method likely sets up spell selection, targeting
    logic, and combat strategies specific to the Mage class. It integrates with the
    EnhancedBot AI system to provide specialized gameplay behavior for Mage bots.
    The method may perform validation checks on the input bot player to ensure it's
    a valid Mage class character before proceeding with AI initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the success status of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    unsupported class types, or system resource limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mage AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get a valid Mage bot player\nint result = factory->CreateMageAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Mage AI successfully created\n    printf(\"Mage AI\
      \ initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create Mage AI: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBot AI system and requires that the bot
    player object be properly initialized with valid Mage class data. The returned
    integer status code should be checked to ensure successful AI creation before
    attempting to use the bot in gameplay scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-Mage class bot player may result in undefined
    behavior or failed initialization. Ensure proper validation of the bot's class
    type before invoking this method.
