  method: UpdatePetManagement
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdatePetManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the management state of the hunter's pet based on current combat
    and tactical conditions.
  description: The UpdatePetManagement method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    how a Marksmanship Hunter controls and manages their summoned pet during gameplay.
    This includes evaluating the pet's current status, positioning, threat levels,
    and the hunter's own abilities to determine optimal pet behavior such as attack
    targeting, defensive actions, or staying in formation. The method integrates with
    the hunter's overall tactical decision-making system to ensure that the pet supports
    the player's combat strategy effectively. It typically runs during each update
    cycle of the game loop and may be triggered by specific events like target changes
    or ability usage.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    hunter.UpdatePetManagement();\n\
      \    // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Updates
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Initialize pet management when entering\
      \ combat\n    hunter.UpdatePetManagement();\n}\n\nvoid OnTargetChange()\n{\n\
      \    // Reassess pet behavior when target changes\n    hunter.UpdatePetManagement();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI logic for Marksmanship Hunters and should
    be called regularly during active gameplay. It relies on internal state tracking
    of both the hunter and their pet, so calling it outside of appropriate contexts
    may lead to inconsistent behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you are implementing custom AI
    logic or debugging. The method is intended to be invoked automatically by the
    game engine's update loop.
