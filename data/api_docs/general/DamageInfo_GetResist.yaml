  class: DamageInfo
  method: GetResist
  signature: uint32 DamageInfo::GetResist() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of damage resisted by the target.
  description: The GetResist method retrieves the total resistance value applied to
    a damage instance, which represents how much of the incoming damage was mitigated
    due to the target's resistance properties. This value is typically calculated
    during the damage application process and reflects the combined effect of all
    applicable resistances such as spell resistance, armor, or magical resistance.
    The returned value is expressed in raw damage units and can be used for logging,
    debugging, or calculating final damage outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total amount of damage that was resisted
    by the target during the damage application process. This value indicates how
    much of the original damage was reduced due to resistance mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Damage Calculation
    code: "void HandleDamageDeal(Unit* attacker, Unit* victim) {\n    DamageInfo damageInfo;\n\
      \    // ... populate damageInfo with relevant data ...\n    uint32 resistAmount\
      \ = damageInfo.GetResist();\n    uint32 finalDamage = damageInfo.GetDamage()\
      \ - resistAmount;\n    // Apply finalDamage to victim\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Resisted Damage for Debugging
    code: "void LogResistedDamage(Unit* target, DamageInfo& damageInfo) {\n    uint32\
      \ resist = damageInfo.GetResist();\n    if (resist > 0) {\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_COMBAT,\
      \ \"Target %s resisted %u damage.\", \n                      target->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ resist);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the DamageInfo object has been fully
    initialized and processed with resistance calculations. The returned value is
    not necessarily equal to the difference between original and final damage, as
    other mitigation effects may also apply.
  warnings: Do not use this method on uninitialized DamageInfo objects, as it may
    return undefined values. Also note that resistances are calculated based on the
    target's current state, so calling this method at different points in a damage
    sequence may yield different results.
