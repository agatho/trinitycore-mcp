  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: NotifyTeleportStart
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::NotifyTeleportStart(Player * player, const
    std::string & dungeonName)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies a player that they are starting to teleport to a dungeon.
  description: The NotifyTeleportStart method is used by the LFGGroupCoordinator to
    inform a specific player that their teleportation process to a designated dungeon
    has begun. This method typically gets invoked during the Looking For Group (LFG)
    system's workflow when a player is about to be transported to a dungeon instance.
    It serves as part of the communication mechanism between the group coordinator
    and individual players, ensuring that players are aware of their upcoming teleportation
    event. The method does not perform the actual teleportation but rather signals
    the start of this process to the player client.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player who will be
      teleported. This parameter must not be null and should refer to a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  - name: dungeonName
    description: A string containing the name of the dungeon that the player is being
      teleported to. This string is typically used for UI display purposes and localization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG coordination
    code: "void SomeLFGHandler::StartTeleportToDungeon(Player* player, const std::string&\
      \ dungeonName)\n{\n    LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \    if (coordinator)\n    {\n        coordinator->NotifyTeleportStart(player,\
      \ dungeonName);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    when a player's teleportation to a dungeon instance is imminent. It is expected
    that this method will trigger client-side UI updates to inform the player about
    the upcoming teleport.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and that the dungeonName
    string is properly formatted before calling this method, as invalid parameters
    could lead to client-side errors or incorrect UI behavior.
