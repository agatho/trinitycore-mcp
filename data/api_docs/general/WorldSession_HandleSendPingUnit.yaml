  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSendPingUnit(const WorldPackets::Party::SendPingUnit
    & pingUnit)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a ping unit packet sent by the client to indicate player interaction
    with a unit.
  description: The HandleSendPingUnit method handles incoming ping unit packets from
    players, typically triggered when a player clicks on a unit in the game world.
    This method processes the packet to determine if any special actions or responses
    should be taken based on the interaction. It's part of the party and group management
    system, allowing players to communicate with their group members about units they
    are interacting with. The method does not return any value but may trigger internal
    game logic such as updating unit visibility or initiating communication within
    the group.
  parameters:
  - name: pingUnit
    description: The packet containing information about the pinged unit, including
      its GUID and other relevant data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSendPingUnit(const WorldPackets::Party::SendPingUnit\
      \ & pingUnit)\n{\n    // Process the ping unit packet\n    if (Player* player\
      \ = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        // Log the ping or trigger group notification\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player %s pinged unit with GUID: %u\", player->GetName(),\
      \ pingUnit.UnitGUID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during party/group interactions where players
    need to communicate about specific units in the game world. It's part of the core
    networking system and should be handled efficiently to avoid performance bottlenecks.
