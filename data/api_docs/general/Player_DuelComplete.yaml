  method: DuelComplete
  signature: void Player::DuelComplete(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a duel between two players and returns the result to the dueling
    party.
  description: The DuelComplete method is responsible for finalizing a duel between
    two players in World of Warcraft. It handles the cleanup of duel-related data,
    including removing duel status effects, resetting player positions, and awarding
    appropriate rewards or penalties based on the duel outcome. This method is typically
    invoked when one player surrenders or when both players reach the end of a duel.
    The method ensures that the dueling system operates correctly by managing the
    transition from active duel state to post-duel state.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of duel completion. This parameter determines how the duel
      is concluded - whether it's a surrender, victory, or other outcome. Valid values
      include 0 (surrender), 1 (victory), and 2 (draw).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Duel Completion Example
    code: 'Player* player1 = new Player();

      Player* player2 = new Player();


      // Simulate a duel completion

      player1->DuelComplete(0); // Complete with surrender

      player2->DuelComplete(1); // Complete with victory'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a duel
    ends. Developers should be aware that this method does not directly handle player
    movement or state changes, but rather manages the duel-specific mechanics and
    rewards.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect duel outcomes,
    potentially causing players to remain in dueling status or lose rewards incorrectly.
    Care must be taken when implementing custom duel logic.
