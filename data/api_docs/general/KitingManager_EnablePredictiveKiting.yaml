  class: KitingManager
  method: EnablePredictiveKiting
  signature: void KitingManager::EnablePredictiveKiting(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the predictive kiting feature for the KitingManager instance.
  description: The EnablePredictiveKiting method controls whether the KitingManager
    will utilize predictive kiting mechanics. Predictive kiting is a behavior where
    the AI attempts to anticipate the movement of targets and adjust its positioning
    accordingly to maintain optimal distance and combat effectiveness. This method
    takes a boolean parameter to enable or disable this feature. When enabled, the
    manager may modify its pathfinding and movement logic to account for target velocity
    and trajectory prediction. The change takes effect immediately on the current
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      predictive kiting behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Predictive Kiting
    code: 'KitingManager* manager = new KitingManager();

      manager->EnablePredictiveKiting(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Predictive Kiting
    code: 'KitingManager* manager = GetPlayer()->GetKitingManager();

      manager->EnablePredictiveKiting(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the specific KitingManager instance it is called
    on. Changes to predictive kiting behavior do not persist across server restarts
    or player sessions unless explicitly saved in the game state. The implementation
    likely involves adjustments to movement calculations and pathfinding algorithms.
