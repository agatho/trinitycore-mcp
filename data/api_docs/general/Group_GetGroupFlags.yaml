  method: GetGroupFlags
  signature: GroupFlags Group::GetGroupFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the group flags indicating the type and properties of the group.
  description: The GetGroupFlags method returns a GroupFlags enumeration that represents
    the current configuration and capabilities of the group. This includes information
    about whether the group is a raid, party, or instance group, as well as its loot
    settings, leadership status, and other behavioral attributes. The returned flags
    are used internally by the game engine to determine how to handle group operations
    such as loot distribution, member management, and quest progression. This method
    does not modify any state and can be called at any time during the group's lifetime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupFlags enumeration value that combines various flag bits indicating
    the group's properties and behavior. Possible flags may include GROUP_FLAG_RAID,
    GROUP_FLAG_BG, GROUP_FLAG_INSTANCE, GROUP_FLAG_LOOT_METHOD, and others depending
    on the group's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check if group is a raid
    code: "if (group->GetGroupFlags() & GROUP_FLAG_RAID)\n{\n    // Handle raid-specific\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a raid group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine loot method
    code: "GroupFlags flags = group->GetGroupFlags();\nif (flags & GROUP_FLAG_LOOT_METHOD)\n\
      {\n    // Extract loot method from flags\n    uint8 lootMethod = flags & 0x0F;\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Loot method: %u\", lootMethod);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GroupFlags value returned by this method is cached and may not reflect
    real-time changes until the group state is updated. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads immutable group properties.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned GroupFlags value directly, as it's a const
    reference to internal state. Any modifications should be done through appropriate
    group management methods rather than by altering the flags directly.
