documentation:
  brief: Returns the sell price of an item template.
  description: The GetSellPrice method retrieves the gold value at which an item can
    be sold to a vendor. This value is typically derived from the item's base cost,
    quality, and other properties defined in the item template. The returned value
    represents the amount of gold a player would receive when selling the item back
    to a vendor. This method does not account for any modifiers such as player reputation
    or vendor-specific pricing adjustments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the sell price of the item in gold coins. Returns
    0 if the item cannot be sold to vendors.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Item Sell Price
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    uint32 sellPrice = itemTemplate->GetSellPrice();\n    printf(\"The sell\
      \ price of the item is %u gold.\\n\", sellPrice);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns the base sell price as defined in the item template
    and does not consider dynamic factors such as player reputation, faction bonuses,
    or temporary modifiers that might affect actual vendor pricing in-game.
