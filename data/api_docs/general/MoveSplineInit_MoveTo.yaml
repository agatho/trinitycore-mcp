  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: MoveTo
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::MoveTo(float x, float y, float z, bool generatePath,
    bool forceDestination)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a spline-based movement to the specified coordinates with optional
    path generation and destination enforcement.
  description: The MoveTo method initializes a spline-based movement for an object
    (typically a creature or player) to a given set of 3D coordinates. It prepares
    the movement path using the TrinityCore's spline system, which handles smooth
    interpolation between waypoints. The method supports generating a path automatically
    if requested and can enforce reaching the exact destination even if it requires
    adjustments. This is commonly used in AI behavior scripts, NPC movement, or player-controlled
    character movements where precise positioning is required. The movement will be
    processed asynchronously through the server's movement system, and the actual
    execution depends on the object's current state and available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the destination point in world space
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the destination point in world space
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the destination point in world space
  - name: generatePath
    description: If true, automatically generates a path between current position
      and target coordinates; if false, assumes a direct path or uses existing path
      data
  - name: forceDestination
    description: If true, ensures the object reaches exactly the specified destination
      coordinates even if it requires overriding normal movement constraints or adjustments
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement to Coordinates
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init(movementInfo);

      init.MoveTo(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Force Exact Destination Positioning
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init(movementInfo);

      init.MoveTo(150.5f, 300.7f, 75.2f, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately execute movement; it sets up the spline
    configuration for later processing by the movement handler. The actual movement
    will occur according to the object's speed and movement flags. When generatePath
    is set to true, pathfinding logic may be invoked which could introduce slight
    delays depending on map complexity. For performance-critical applications, consider
    pre-calculating paths or using alternative methods like MoveByPath when possible.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the MoveSplineInit
    object or with invalid coordinates can lead to undefined behavior or movement
    errors. The forceDestination parameter should be used carefully as it may override
    physics or collision detection in some cases, potentially causing objects to move
    through terrain or other obstacles.
