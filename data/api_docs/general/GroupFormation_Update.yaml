  method: Update
  signature: void GroupFormation::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group formation state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method in the GroupFormation class is responsible for processing
    and maintaining the current state of group formations within the game world. It
    typically handles logic such as positioning adjustments, formation synchronization,
    or cleanup tasks that need to occur periodically. This method is called by the
    game loop at regular intervals with a time delta parameter indicating how much
    time has passed since the last update. The implementation may involve checking
    for player movement, adjusting positions to maintain formation integrity, or triggering
    events when formations are completed or disrupted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = new GroupFormation();

      formation->Update(50); // Update with 50ms elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or a dedicated update
    thread. It's important to ensure that all formation-related data structures are
    properly initialized before calling this method. The implementation may perform
    operations that affect player positioning, so care should be taken when modifying
    formation properties during an active update cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GroupFormation
    object can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, frequent calls
    with very small time deltas might cause performance issues if the internal logic
    is computationally expensive.
