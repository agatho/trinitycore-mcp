  class: RBACPermission
  method: AddLinkedPermission
  signature: void RBACPermission::AddLinkedPermission(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a linked permission ID to the current RBAC permission.
  description: The AddLinkedPermission method associates a specified permission ID
    with the current RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission. This allows for
    hierarchical permission structures where one permission can depend on or link
    to another. The method does not validate whether the provided ID corresponds to
    an existing permission, so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure the ID is
    valid. This functionality supports the flexible permission management system used
    in TrinityCore for controlling access to game features and commands.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be linked. Must be a valid
      permission ID registered within the RBAC system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Linking a Permission to Another
    code: 'RBACPermission* perm = new RBACPermission();

      perm->AddLinkedPermission(1001);

      perm->AddLinkedPermission(1002);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the RBAC permission object by
    adding a new linked ID. It is typically used during initialization or configuration
    of permissions, and changes made are not persisted automatically to the database
    unless explicitly saved.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided ID corresponds to an existing permission in the
    system; otherwise, the linkage may be ineffective or cause unexpected behavior
    when checking permission validity.
