documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates instance data for the map
  description: The CreateInstanceData method is responsible for initializing the instance
    data associated with an InstanceMap. This method is typically called during the
    creation or loading of a dungeon, raid, or other instance-based content. It sets
    up internal structures and data members required for tracking the state of the
    instance, including boss states, event progress, and any custom instance-specific
    variables. The method ensures that the map's instance data is properly allocated
    and configured before the instance becomes active for players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Creation
    code: "class MyInstanceMap : public InstanceMap\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\n\
      \    {\n        CreateInstanceData();\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ code\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core during instance
    loading, but may also be called manually in custom implementations. Developers
    should ensure that any custom instance data is properly initialized after calling
    this method.
