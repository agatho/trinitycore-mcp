documentation:
  brief: Scans and identifies rare spawn locations within the current map for advanced
    AI behavior.
  description: The FindRareSpawns method performs a comprehensive search of the active
    map to locate and catalog rare or uncommon mob spawn points. This functionality
    is typically used by advanced AI systems to optimize pathfinding, quest completion,
    or encounter preparation. The method iterates through all relevant spawn data
    within the current zone, identifying entities that meet criteria for being classified
    as 'rare' based on predefined thresholds such as spawn rate, loot distribution,
    or NPC type. It updates internal tracking structures that can be queried later
    by other AI components to make informed decisions about player behavior or event
    triggers.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n   \
      \ {\n        m_behaviorManager.FindRareSpawns();\n        m_updateTimer = 5000;\
      \ // Update every 5 seconds\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_updateTimer -=\
      \ diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is computationally intensive and should not be called too frequently
    to avoid performance degradation. It relies on internal map data structures and
    may require the map to be fully loaded before execution. The results are cached
    internally for subsequent queries, so repeated calls without changes in spawn
    conditions will return cached data.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-frequency AI updates can cause noticeable
    lag. Ensure that it's only invoked when necessary, such as at periodic intervals
    or after significant map events. Avoid calling it from time-critical code paths
    where performance is paramount.
