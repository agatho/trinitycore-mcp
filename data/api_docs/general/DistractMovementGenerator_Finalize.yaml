  class: DistractMovementGenerator
  method: Finalize
  signature: void DistractMovementGenerator::Finalize(int * param0, bool param1, bool
    param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the distraction movement generator's finalization process by cleaning
    up resources and resetting internal state.
  description: The Finalize method in DistractMovementGenerator is responsible for
    performing cleanup operations when the movement generator is being terminated
    or deactivated. This includes releasing any allocated resources, resetting internal
    flags, and ensuring that the movement generator returns to a clean state. The
    method is typically called during the destruction or deactivation phase of the
    movement generator's lifecycle. It ensures proper resource management and prevents
    memory leaks or undefined behavior in the AI movement system. In the context of
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method helps maintain stable AI behavior
    by ensuring that distraction-based movement patterns are properly cleaned up when
    no longer needed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may represent a state flag or
      counter used during finalization. Value is typically set to 0 or reset to initial
      state.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the movement generator should perform
      cleanup of active movement data. When true, it ensures all movement-related
      resources are released.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag controlling whether to reset internal state variables.
      When true, resets flags and counters to default values for reuse.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalize Usage
    code: 'DistractMovementGenerator generator;

      generator.Finalize(nullptr, true, true); // Clean up all resources and reset
      state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Finalize with Custom Parameters
    code: 'int stateFlag = 5;

      bool cleanupMovementData = false;

      bool resetInternalState = true;

      generator.Finalize(&stateFlag, cleanupMovementData, resetInternalState); //
      Partial cleanup with custom parameters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the destruction or deactivation
    of a DistractMovementGenerator instance. Calling it prematurely may result in
    inconsistent AI behavior or resource leaks. The method is designed to be idempotent,
    meaning multiple calls should not cause issues. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly interact with the game world objects but manages internal
    state for the movement generator.
  warnings: Do not call Finalize on an already destroyed movement generator instance
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all references to the
    movement generator are cleared before calling Finalize to prevent dangling pointer
    issues.
