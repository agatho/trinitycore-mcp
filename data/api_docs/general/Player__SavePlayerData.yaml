documentation:
  brief: Saves player data to the database with transaction handling
  description: This method saves all player data including character attributes, inventory
    items, and quest progress to the database using a transaction. It ensures data
    consistency by wrapping the save operation in a database transaction, preventing
    data corruption during save operations. The method is typically called during
    player logout or when the server shuts down to ensure all player data is properly
    persisted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SavePlayerData(0);

      // This saves player data to database with transaction 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses the TrinityCore database
    system to save player data. It''s important to note that this method should only
    be called when the player is in a valid state, and it may not be safe to call
    during active gameplay operations. Performance considerations include transaction
    overhead which can impact server performance if called frequently.'
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay or combat situations
    as it may cause database locking issues. Also, calling this method without proper
    transaction handling can lead to data inconsistencies in the database.
