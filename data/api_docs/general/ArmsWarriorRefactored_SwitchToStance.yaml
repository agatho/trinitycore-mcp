  class: ArmsWarriorRefactored
  method: SwitchToStance
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::SwitchToStance(WarriorAI::WarriorStance stance)
documentation:
  brief: Switches the warrior AI to the specified stance.
  description: The SwitchToStance method is used to change the current stance of a
    warrior AI character. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, warriors can
    exist in different stances (e.g., Battle Stance, Defensive Stance, Berserker Stance),
    each with distinct mechanics and abilities. This method ensures that the AI transitions
    smoothly into the desired stance, updating relevant internal states and potentially
    triggering stance-specific behaviors or cooldowns. The method does not return
    any value and operates directly on the instance's current stance state.
  parameters:
  - name: stance
    description: The target warrior stance to switch to. This parameter must be a
      valid WarriorStance enum value, such as BattleStance, DefensiveStance, or BerserkerStance.
      Invalid values may result in undefined behavior or no change in stance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Switch to Battle Stance
    code: warriorAI->SwitchToStance(WarriorAI::BattleStance);
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Stance Switching Based on Health
    code: "if (player->GetHealth() < player->GetMaxHealth() / 2)\n{\n    warriorAI->SwitchToStance(WarriorAI::DefensiveStance);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    warriorAI->SwitchToStance(WarriorAI::BattleStance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI is in a state where stance
    switching is allowed. It may internally perform checks to ensure that the transition
    is valid, such as ensuring the warrior is not in combat or under certain buffs/conditions
    that prevent stance changes.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation might lead to inconsistent
    AI behavior or game state corruption. Ensure that the target stance is compatible
    with the current situation (e.g., not switching to Defensive Stance while in combat
    if it's not allowed).
