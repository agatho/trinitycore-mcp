  method: IsMovingToNode
  signature: bool GatheringManager::IsMovingToNode() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently moving toward a gathering node.
  description: The IsMovingToNode method determines whether the player character is
    in the process of moving towards a specific gathering node, such as a mining vein,
    herbalism plant, or other resource node. This method is typically used by the
    GatheringManager to track the player's movement state during resource collection
    activities. It returns true if the player has initiated movement toward a node
    and has not yet reached it, and false otherwise. The method does not consider
    whether the player has successfully gathered the resource or if they are idle
    at the node.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently moving toward a gathering node;
    returns false if the player is not moving or has reached the target node.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Gathering Logic
    code: "if (gatheringManager->IsMovingToNode()) {\n    // Player is moving to a\
      \ node, prevent new movement\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with initiating movement\
      \ to a new node"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement State Checks
    code: "void PlayerGatheringHandler::HandleGatherRequest(Player* player) {\n  \
      \  if (gatheringManager->IsMovingToNode()) {\n        // Cancel current movement\
      \ and start new one\n        player->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n    }\n  \
      \  // Begin moving to the target node\n    gatheringManager->MoveToNode(targetNode);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the player's movement path.
    It may not reflect real-time changes in movement if called outside of the game
    loop or during asynchronous operations. The method should be used primarily within
    the context of gathering mechanics and movement handling systems.
  warnings: Do not assume this method provides real-time position updates. If used
    in a high-frequency polling scenario, it could lead to performance issues. Also,
    this method does not validate whether the target node is still valid or accessible.
