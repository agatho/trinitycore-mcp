documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the set of optimal hyperparameters for machine learning models
    used in game analytics.
  description: The GetOptimalHyperparameters method returns a map containing key-value
    pairs of hyperparameter names and their corresponding optimal float values. This
    method is typically used within the LearningAnalytics class to fetch pre-computed
    or dynamically determined hyperparameters that are optimized for specific game
    behavior prediction models. These parameters may influence how AI systems interpret
    player actions, adjust difficulty scaling, or optimize resource allocation in
    real-time. The returned map should be treated as read-only and represents a snapshot
    of current optimal configuration values at the time of invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::unordered_map<std::string, float> where each key is the name of
    a hyperparameter (as a string) and each value is its corresponding optimal float
    setting. The map may be empty if no optimal hyperparameters have been computed
    or set yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::unordered_map<std::string, float> hyperparams\
      \ = analytics.GetOptimalHyperparameters();\nfor (const auto& pair : hyperparams)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Parameter: \" << pair.first << \" = \" << pair.second\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if the underlying data structure is properly
    synchronized, but developers should verify that concurrent access to the returned
    map does not cause race conditions. The returned map is a copy and modifications
    to it will not affect the internal state of the LearningAnalytics object.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on the contents of this map for critical game
    logic, as hyperparameter values may change dynamically based on system load or
    training updates. Ensure that your code gracefully handles cases where the returned
    map is empty.
