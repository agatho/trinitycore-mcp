  class: Vehicle
  method: GetDespawnDelay
  signature: int Vehicle::GetDespawnDelay()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the despawn delay time in milliseconds for the vehicle.
  description: The GetDespawnDelay method retrieves the amount of time, in milliseconds,
    that a vehicle will remain active before automatically despawning. This value
    is typically set during vehicle creation or through configuration and determines
    how long the vehicle persists after its rider has dismounted or when the vehicle
    becomes inactive. The delay helps manage memory usage and ensures vehicles do
    not linger indefinitely in the world. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with vehicle lifecycle management to control when a vehicle should be removed
    from the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the despawn delay time in milliseconds. A
    return value of 0 indicates that the vehicle will despawn immediately upon meeting
    the conditions, while positive values indicate a delay period before despawning
    occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Despawn Delay
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    int delay\
      \ = vehicle->GetDespawnDelay();\n    std::cout << \"Vehicle despawn delay: \"\
      \ << delay << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core vehicle system in TrinityCore and relies
    on internal vehicle state tracking. The returned value may be affected by server
    configuration settings or custom modifications to vehicle behavior.
