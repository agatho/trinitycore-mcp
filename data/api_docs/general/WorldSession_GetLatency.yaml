  class: WorldSession
  method: GetLatency
  signature: uint32 WorldSession::GetLatency() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the latency in milliseconds of the current WorldSession.
  description: The GetLatency method retrieves the round-trip time between the client
    and the server for the current session. This value represents how long it takes
    for a packet to travel from the player's client to the server and back, which
    is crucial for determining network performance and player experience. The latency
    is typically updated periodically as ping packets are sent and received. This
    method is commonly used in game mechanics such as determining if a player's connection
    is acceptable or for debugging network-related issues.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the latency in milliseconds. A lower value
    indicates better network performance, while higher values may suggest connection
    issues or high server load.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Latency
    code: "uint32 latency = session->GetLatency();\nif (latency > 500)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      High latency detected: %u ms\", latency);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Latency in a Player Status Report
    code: "void SendPlayerStatusReport(Player* player)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = player->GetSession();\n    uint32 latency = session->GetLatency();\n   \
      \ ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Your current connection\
      \ latency is %u ms.\", latency);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The latency value may be updated asynchronously as ping packets are exchanged.
    This method does not perform any blocking operations and returns immediately with
    the last known latency value. The value is typically maintained by internal network
    handling code within the WorldSession class.
