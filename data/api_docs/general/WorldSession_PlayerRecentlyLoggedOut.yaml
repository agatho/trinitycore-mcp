  signature: bool WorldSession::PlayerRecentlyLoggedOut() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has recently logged out of the game.
  description: The PlayerRecentlyLoggedOut method determines whether the player associated
    with this session has recently disconnected or logged out. This check is typically
    used to prevent certain actions or interactions that should not occur immediately
    after a player's logout, such as preventing duplicate character loading or ensuring
    proper cleanup of session resources. The method evaluates internal session state
    flags and timing information to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has recently logged out (within a defined time
    window), otherwise returns false. This indicates that the session is in a transitional
    state where the player's character data may not yet be fully available or consistent.
  examples:
  - title: Check for recent logout before allowing character interaction
    code: "if (!session->PlayerRecentlyLoggedOut()) {\n    // Allow normal character\
      \ operations\n    session->HandleCharacterOpcode(opcode);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Reject operations during logout transition\n    session->SendNotification(\"\
      Cannot perform this action while logging out.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal session timers and state tracking to
    determine recent logout status. It may be used in conjunction with other session
    management functions to ensure proper handling of player transitions between online
    and offline states.
