  brief: Retrieves the temporary bonus value applied to a specific skill for the player.
  description: This method returns the temporary bonus value that has been applied
    to a particular skill for the current player. The bonus value is typically used
    in conjunction with skill levels and can be influenced by various game mechanics
    such as buffs, potions, or other temporary effects. It is important to note that
    this value may change during gameplay based on different factors and should be
    used carefully when calculating skill-related statistics. The method is part of
    the player's skill management system and provides access to temporary skill bonuses.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int16 representing the temporary bonus value applied to the
    specified skill, or zero if no bonus is active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int16 bonus = player->GetSkillTempBonusValue(129); // Get bonus for Alchemy
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 skillID = 129; // Alchemy\nint16 bonus = player->GetSkillTempBonusValue(skillID);\n\
      if (bonus > 0)\n{\n    // Apply bonus to skill calculation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    and should be considered when calculating player skill values. The value returned
    may be zero if no temporary bonus is applied, or it could be negative if a penalty
    is active.
  warnings: The value returned by this method might not reflect the actual skill level
    if there are active temporary bonuses that have not been properly accounted for
    in calculations. Be cautious when using this value for skill calculations.
