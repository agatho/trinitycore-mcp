  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GetOptimizationSuggestions
  signature: std::vector<std::string> AIDecisionProfiler::GetOptimizationSuggestions(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates optimization suggestions for AI decision-making based on profiling
    data for a specified bot.
  description: The GetOptimizationSuggestions method analyzes the profiling data collected
    by the AIDecisionProfiler to provide actionable recommendations for improving
    AI performance. It evaluates decision-making patterns, execution times, and resource
    usage of AI bots within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used
    during development or debugging phases to identify bottlenecks in AI behavior.
    The returned suggestions are formatted as human-readable strings that can guide
    developers in optimizing bot logic and decision trees.
  parameters: []
  returns: A vector of strings containing optimization suggestions for AI decision-making.
    Each string represents a specific recommendation based on profiling data, such
    as reducing redundant checks, improving condition evaluation order, or optimizing
    decision tree structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\nstd::vector<std::string> suggestions = profiler.GetOptimizationSuggestions(12345);\n\
      for (const auto& suggestion : suggestions) {\n    std::cout << \"Suggestion:\
      \ \" << suggestion << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on profiling data that must be collected prior to calling
    it. The suggestions are only as accurate as the data gathered during the profiling
    phase. Performance impact is minimal since it's a read-only operation on existing
    profiling data.
  warnings: Ensure that profiling has been enabled and sufficient data has been collected
    before calling this method, otherwise the suggestions may be empty or misleading.
    This method does not modify any internal state of the profiler.
