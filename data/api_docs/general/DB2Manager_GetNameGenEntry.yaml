  signature: std::string DB2Manager::GetNameGenEntry(uint8 race, uint8 gender) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name generation entry for a specified race and gender from
    the DB2 database.
  description: The GetNameGenEntry method fetches a name generation entry based on
    the provided race and gender parameters. This method is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine which name patterns or templates should
    be used when generating character names for players of different races and genders.
    The returned string likely represents a reference to a specific name generation
    rule set within the game's data files, which may include lists of first names,
    last names, or formatting rules for constructing full names. This functionality
    supports the dynamic naming system that allows for culturally appropriate and
    gender-specific character names in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier (uint8) for which to retrieve the name generation
      entry. Valid values correspond to the standard World of Warcraft race constants
      (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for Orc, etc.).
  - name: gender
    description: The gender identifier (uint8) for which to retrieve the name generation
      entry. Valid values are typically 0 for male and 1 for female, though some implementations
      may use different conventions.
  returns: A std::string representing the name generation entry associated with the
    specified race and gender. This string usually serves as a key or reference to
    lookup specific naming rules in the DB2 data files.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Name Generation Entry for Human Male
    code: "std::string nameGen = sDB2Manager->GetNameGenEntry(1, 0); // Human male\n\
      if (!nameGen.empty()) {\n    // Use the name generation entry to construct character\
      \ names\n    std::cout << \"Name generation pattern: \" << nameGen << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Name Generation Entry for Orc Female
    code: "uint8 orcFemale = 2; // Orc race, female gender\nstd::string entry = sDB2Manager->GetNameGenEntry(orcFemale,\
      \ 1);\nif (entry.empty()) {\n    // Handle case where no name generation entry\
      \ exists\n    std::cerr << \"No name generation data found for Orc female\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Process the retrieved name generation entry\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Found name pattern: \" << entry << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures that must be properly
    loaded and initialized before calling. The implementation likely caches results
    for performance reasons, but developers should not assume thread safety without
    explicit synchronization. The actual name generation logic may depend on additional
    data beyond what this single method returns.
  warnings: Ensure that the race and gender parameters are within valid ranges to
    avoid undefined behavior or incorrect lookups. This method does not validate input
    parameters, so calling with invalid values might return unexpected or empty strings.
