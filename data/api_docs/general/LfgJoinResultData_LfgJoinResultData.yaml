  class: LfgJoinResultData
  method: LfgJoinResultData
  signature: void LfgJoinResultData::LfgJoinResultData(LfgJoinResult _result, LfgRoleCheckState
    _state)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgJoinResultData object with the specified result and
    role check state.
  description: The LfgJoinResultData constructor initializes an instance of the LfgJoinResultData
    class with the provided LfgJoinResult and LfgRoleCheckState values. This class
    is used to store and manage the outcome of a player's attempt to join a Looking
    for Group (LFG) dungeon or scenario. The result parameter indicates whether the
    join was successful or if there were any issues, while the state parameter represents
    the current role check status for the group. This constructor is typically called
    internally by the TrinityCore LFG system when processing player join requests.
  parameters:
  - name: _result
    description: The LfgJoinResult value indicating the outcome of the LFG join attempt.
      Possible values include LFG_JOIN_SUCCESS, LFG_JOIN_FAILED, LFG_JOIN_NOT_LEADER,
      LFG_JOIN_NO_SLOTS, etc.
  - name: _state
    description: The LfgRoleCheckState value representing the current role check status
      for the group. Values may include LFG_ROLECHECK_DEFAULT, LFG_ROLECHECK_FINISHED,
      LFG_ROLECHECK_ABORTED, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: LfgJoinResultData resultData(LFG_JOIN_SUCCESS, LFG_ROLECHECK_DEFAULT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Failure Result
    code: LfgJoinResultData failureData(LFG_JOIN_FAILED, LFG_ROLECHECK_ABORTED);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal LFG system implementation and should
    not be called directly by external code. The class is designed to work with TrinityCore's
    LFG framework and may require proper initialization of other related systems before
    being used effectively.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor directly unless you are implementing or extending
    the LFG system. Improper usage can lead to undefined behavior in the LFG subsystem.
    Ensure that the provided parameters are valid LFG enum values.
