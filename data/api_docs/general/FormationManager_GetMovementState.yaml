api:
  class: FormationManager
  method: GetMovementState
  signature: FormationMovementState FormationManager::GetMovementState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current movement state of the formation manager.
  description: The GetMovementState method returns the FormationMovementState enum
    value that represents the current movement behavior or status of the formation
    manager. This is typically used in AI-driven group movement systems where units
    need to follow specific movement patterns such as marching, flanking, or regrouping.
    The returned state can be used by other systems to determine how units should
    behave in relation to each other within a formation. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationMovementState enum value indicating the current movement
    behavior of the formation manager. Possible values may include states like IDLE,
    MOVING, FLANKING, REGROUPING, or other movement-related enums defined in the FormationMovementState
    enumeration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationMovementState state = formationManager.GetMovementState();\nif\
      \ (state == FORMATION_MOVEMENT_STATE_MOVING)\n{\n    // Handle moving formation\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: State-Based Behavior Switching
    code: "FormationMovementState state = formationManager.GetMovementState();\nswitch\
      \ (state)\n{\n    case FORMATION_MOVEMENT_STATE_IDLE:\n        // Do nothing\
      \ or wait\n        break;\n    case FORMATION_MOVEMENT_STATE_MOVING:\n     \
      \   // Continue movement\n        break;\n    case FORMATION_MOVEMENT_STATE_FLANKING:\n\
      \        // Execute flanking maneuver\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and does not modify the internal state of the FormationManager.
    It's safe to call from multiple threads if the underlying data is properly synchronized.
    The returned value reflects the state at the time of the method call and may change
    on subsequent calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationMovementState enum values are properly defined
    and consistent across all modules using this API. If the formation manager has
    not been initialized or configured, the returned state might be undefined or default
    to an unexpected value.
