  class: CreatureAI
  method: IsInBoundary
  signature: bool CreatureAI::IsInBoundary(const Position * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is within the creature's defined boundary limits.
  description: The IsInBoundary method determines whether a specified Position object
    lies within the spatial boundaries that have been configured for the creature's
    AI behavior. This functionality is commonly used in AI scripts to ensure creatures
    remain within designated areas, such as patrol routes or restricted zones. The
    method evaluates the position against internal boundary data stored by the CreatureAI
    instance, which may be defined through various means including waypoints, spawn
    coordinates, or custom boundary definitions. It returns true if the position is
    inside the boundary and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: A pointer to a Position object representing the coordinates to check
      against the creature's boundary limits. This parameter must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is within the creature's defined
    boundary, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (!creatureAI->IsInBoundary(&playerPos)) {\n    // Player is outside\
      \ boundary, take action\n    creatureAI->DoAction(ACTION_PLAYER_OUT_OF_BOUNDS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking patrol point validity
    code: "Position patrolPoint;\npatrolPoint.Relocate(123.45f, 678.90f, 100.0f, 0.0f);\n\
      if (creatureAI->IsInBoundary(&patrolPoint)) {\n    // Proceed with patrol logic\n\
      \    creatureAI->MoveTo(patrolPoint);\n} else {\n    // Adjust or skip this\
      \ patrol point\n    creatureAI->SetNextWaypoint();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the CreatureAI instance having properly initialized
    boundary data. The boundary definition may be set through various mechanisms such
    as waypoint systems, spawn area constraints, or custom AI logic. Performance is
    generally efficient as it involves simple coordinate comparisons against stored
    boundary limits.
  warnings: Ensure that the Position parameter passed to this method is valid and
    not null; passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also note that boundary definitions may be dynamic and could change during runtime,
    so repeated calls might yield different results.
