  class: ObjectCache
  method: NeedsRefresh
  signature: bool ObjectCache::NeedsRefresh(uint32 now) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object cache requires a refresh based on the current
    time.
  description: The NeedsRefresh method evaluates if the cached object data has expired
    and needs to be refreshed. It compares the current timestamp against the cache's
    internal expiration time to decide if a refresh operation is necessary. This method
    is typically used in systems where cached data must be periodically updated to
    maintain consistency with the live game state. The cache may contain various types
    of objects such as players, creatures, or game entities that require periodic
    updates to reflect changes in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cache has expired and requires a refresh; otherwise
    returns false if the cache is still valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Refresh Check
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nif (myObjectCache.NeedsRefresh(currentTime))\
      \ {\n    // Perform cache refresh logic here\n    myObjectCache.Refresh();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's internal systems for managing
    cached data across different subsystems. The implementation likely uses a time-based
    expiration mechanism where each cache entry has an associated TTL (Time To Live)
    value that gets checked against the current system time.
