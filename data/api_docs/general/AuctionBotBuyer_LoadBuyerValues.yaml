  brief: Initializes and configures buyer settings for the auction bot system
  description: The LoadBuyerValues method is responsible for loading and applying
    configuration values to an AuctionBotBuyer instance. This method processes buyer-specific
    settings such as bid amounts, item categories, price thresholds, and other purchasing
    parameters that define how the auction bot behaves when making purchases. It typically
    reads from configuration files or database entries to populate internal buyer
    state. The method ensures that all necessary buyer parameters are properly initialized
    before the bot begins its auction participation activities.
