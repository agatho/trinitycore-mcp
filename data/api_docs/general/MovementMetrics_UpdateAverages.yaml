documentation:
  brief: Updates the average movement metrics for a player or unit.
  description: The UpdateAverages method recalculates and stores the average movement-related
    statistics for a given entity, such as a player or creature. This typically involves
    computing averages over a specified time window or number of samples, and is used
    for performance monitoring, gameplay balancing, or tracking movement efficiency.
    The method may be called periodically by the game loop or in response to specific
    movement events. It generally updates internal counters and accumulators before
    calculating new average values.

  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that tracks movement behavior
    for performance analysis or game balance purposes. It may be invoked automatically
    by the server's update loop, or manually during specific gameplay events.
