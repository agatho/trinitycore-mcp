  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: DoReset
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::DoReset(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the waypoint movement generator for a creature, clearing its current
    path and preparing it for new waypoint navigation.
  description: The DoReset method is responsible for resetting the internal state
    of a WaypointMovementGenerator instance. This typically occurs when a creature's
    movement needs to be interrupted or reinitialized, such as when the creature is
    aggroed, respawns, or when a new path is assigned. The method clears any existing
    waypoint data and prepares the generator to begin following a new set of waypoints.
    It ensures that the creature's movement state is properly reset before initiating
    a new movement sequence. This method is part of the AI movement system in TrinityCore
    and is crucial for maintaining proper creature behavior during dynamic gameplay
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object whose waypoint movement generator
      state needs to be reset. This parameter represents the target creature that
      will have its movement path cleared and reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a creature's waypoint movement
    code: "Creature* creature = ...; // Get reference to creature\nWaypointMovementGenerator*\
      \ wpGen = dynamic_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      if (wpGen)\n{\n    wpGen->DoReset(creature);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting movement during creature AI update
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Reset waypoint movement when entering combat\n        if\
      \ (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType() == WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE)\n\
      \        {\n            WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = static_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \            wpGen->DoReset(me);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on movement generators that are actively
    managing creature waypoints. The reset operation clears all internal waypoint
    tracking data, so any ongoing path following will be interrupted. It is typically
    invoked internally by the motion master system but can also be manually triggered
    during custom AI logic.
  warnings: Calling DoReset on a creature that is not currently using a WaypointMovementGenerator
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the current movement
    generator type before calling this method. Additionally, resetting movement during
    active combat or complex AI states should be done carefully to avoid disrupting
    gameplay flow.
