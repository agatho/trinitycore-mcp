  class: Transport
  method: UpdatePassengerPositions
  signature: void Transport::UpdatePassengerPositions(const PassengerSet & passengers)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positions of all passengers aboard the transport entity.
  description: The UpdatePassengerPositions method is responsible for synchronizing
    and updating the world positions of all passengers currently aboard a transport
    vehicle. This method ensures that passenger locations remain consistent with the
    transport's movement, including any rotation, translation, or teleportation events.
    It typically operates during the transport's update cycle to maintain proper spatial
    relationships between the transport and its passengers, preventing desynchronization
    issues in the game world. The method handles coordinate transformations required
    when moving passengers along with the transport's motion.
  parameters:
  - name: passengers
    description: A constant reference to a set of passenger objects currently aboard
      the transport. Each passenger is expected to be a valid WorldObject derived
      class (typically Player or Creature) that has been assigned to this transport.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Transport Update Loop
    code: "void Transport::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    UpdatePassengerPositions(m_passengers);\n    // ... rest of update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Passenger Position Update
    code: "void MyTransport::HandlePassengerMovement()\n{\n    if (!m_passengers.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdatePassengerPositions(m_passengers);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the transport's update loop
    and should not be called manually unless implementing custom transport behavior.
    The method assumes all passengers are valid and properly registered with the transport.
    It performs coordinate transformations to ensure passengers move with the transport's
    current position and orientation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered passenger set may
    result in undefined behavior or client-side desynchronization. Ensure that all
    passengers passed to this method have been correctly added to the transport's
    passenger list before calling.
