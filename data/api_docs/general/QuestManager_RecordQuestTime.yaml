  class: QuestManager
  method: RecordQuestTime
  signature: void QuestManager::RecordQuestTime(uint32 questId, uint32 timeSpent)
documentation:
  brief: Records the time spent on a specific quest for the player.
  description: The RecordQuestTime method logs the amount of time a player has spent
    working on a particular quest. This functionality is typically used to track quest
    completion times, which can be relevant for achievement systems, quest timers,
    or player activity monitoring. The method likely updates internal tracking structures
    within the QuestManager class and may persist this data to the database. It is
    generally called when a player completes or abandons a quest, or at regular intervals
    during quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which time is being recorded.
      This value must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database.
  - name: timeSpent
    description: The amount of time (in seconds) that has been spent on the quest.
      This value should be a positive integer representing elapsed gameplay time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when completing a quest
    code: 'uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 timeSpent = 3600; // 1 hour

      player->GetQuestManager()->RecordQuestTime(questId, timeSpent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording quest time during active gameplay
    code: '// Called periodically while player is engaged with a quest

      uint32 questId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345)->GetQuestId();

      uint32 timeSpent = 60; // 1 minute interval

      player->GetQuestManager()->RecordQuestTime(questId, timeSpent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to store or update quest time
    data. It may also trigger internal events or callbacks related to quest progression
    tracking. The implementation might include checks for valid quest IDs and time
    values to prevent invalid entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId corresponds to an actual active or completed quest,
    as invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Also,
    be cautious about calling this method too frequently during gameplay, as it may
    impact performance if not optimized properly.
