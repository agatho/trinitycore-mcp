  method: HandleDispelMechanic
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandleDispelMechanic(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all mechanic debuffs from a player and boss during dungeon encounters.
  description: The HandleDispelMechanic method is responsible for clearing all mechanic-based
    debuffs that have been applied to both a player and a boss entity within a dungeon
    scenario. This function is typically invoked during specific encounter mechanics
    or when certain conditions are met, such as the completion of a phase or the activation
    of a dispel effect. It ensures that neither the player nor the boss retains any
    lingering mechanic effects that could interfere with subsequent gameplay elements.
    The method operates on references to player and boss entities, allowing for direct
    manipulation of their debuff states.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or entity
      reference within the dungeon context.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's identifier or entity
      reference within the dungeon context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart()\n{\n    int playerGuid = GetPlayer()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    int bossGuid = GetBoss()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    HandleDispelMechanic(&playerGuid,\
      \ &bossGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with conditional logic
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnMechanicTriggered(int mechanicType)\n{\n    if\
      \ (mechanicType == MECHANIC_STUN)\n    {\n        int playerGuid = GetPlayer()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \        int bossGuid = GetBoss()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        HandleDispelMechanic(&playerGuid,\
      \ &bossGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and boss pointers are valid and point
    to active entities within the dungeon. It is recommended to verify entity validity
    before calling this function to prevent undefined behavior. The method directly
    manipulates debuff states, so it should be used carefully in scenarios where debuffs
    are managed by other systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in inconsistent game state or unexpected
    behavior if the player or boss entities are not properly initialized or have already
    been destroyed. Avoid calling this function outside of valid dungeon encounter
    contexts to prevent unintended side effects.
