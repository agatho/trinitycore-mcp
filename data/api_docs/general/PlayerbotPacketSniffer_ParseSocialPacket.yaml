  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseSocialPacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseSocialPacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming social packet data from a player session to extract and
    analyze social interaction information.
  description: The ParseSocialPacket method is responsible for intercepting and parsing
    social-related packets sent by players within the TrinityCore environment. It
    analyzes the packet contents to determine social actions such as friend requests,
    ignore list modifications, or chat messages. This functionality is typically used
    in botting systems or anti-cheat mechanisms to monitor player behavior and maintain
    game integrity. The method operates on a per-session basis, processing data from
    the WorldSession object's incoming packet queue.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the active player
      session. This parameter provides access to session-specific data including player
      information, connection details, and packet handling context.
  - name: packet
    description: Reference to the WorldPacket object containing the social data to
      be parsed. The packet structure contains serialized social interaction data
      that must be interpreted according to the game's protocol.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Parsing
    code: "void ExampleUsage() {\n    WorldSession* session = GetPlayerSession();\n\
      \    WorldPacket packet(CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE, 100);\n    // ... populate packet\
      \ with social data ...\n    sniffer.ParseSocialPacket(session, packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the packet handling pipeline
    of Playerbot systems. It assumes that the packet has already been validated for
    proper structure and contains valid social interaction data. The method may modify
    internal state tracking for social relationships but does not directly send responses
    back to clients.
  warnings: Improper handling of packet data can lead to memory corruption or incorrect
    social relationship tracking. Ensure that all packet data is properly validated
    before calling this method, especially when dealing with user-generated content.
