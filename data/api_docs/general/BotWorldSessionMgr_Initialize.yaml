  class: BotWorldSessionMgr
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot world session manager, setting up necessary data structures
    and subsystems for bot session handling.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotWorldSessionMgr class for managing
    bot sessions within the TrinityCore environment. It typically sets up internal
    data structures, registers necessary callbacks, initializes session pools, and
    performs any required pre-processing to ensure that bot-related functionality
    can operate correctly. This method is usually called during server startup or
    when the bot system is enabled. The initialization process may involve loading
    configuration settings, allocating memory for session tracking, and establishing
    connections or references needed for bot communication with the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all subsystems were
    properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during the initialization
    process, indicating that bot functionality may not be available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "BotWorldSessionMgr sessionMgr;\nbool success = sessionMgr.Initialize();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot system is ready for use\n    printf(\"Bot world session\
      \ manager initialized successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize bot world session manager.\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of the application,
    typically at server startup. Reinitialization attempts may lead to undefined behavior
    or resource leaks if not properly handled by the implementation.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that any previous initialization
    is properly cleaned up before calling this method again.
