documentation:
  brief: Updates the target assessment for group coordination purposes.
  description: The UpdateTargetAssessment method is responsible for recalculating
    and refreshing the current target evaluation within the GroupCoordination system.
    This method typically assesses the relevance, threat level, or priority of targets
    based on group dynamics, player positions, and combat states. It ensures that
    all group members have synchronized information about target priorities, which
    is essential for coordinated gameplay mechanics such as tanking, damage distribution,
    or strategic targeting. The method may be invoked automatically during combat
    updates or manually when target conditions change significantly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    groupCoordination->UpdateTargetAssessment();\n\
      \    // ... continue with updated target priorities ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Target Assessment Update
    code: "void OnTargetChanged(Unit* newTarget)\n{\n    // Update internal target\
      \ reference\n    SetCurrentTarget(newTarget);\n    \n    // Force recalculation\
      \ of target assessment for group\n    groupCoordination->UpdateTargetAssessment();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal recalculations that propagate changes
    to all group members. It should be called sparingly to avoid performance overhead
    during high-frequency combat events. The implementation may utilize cached target
    data and only re-evaluate when necessary.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    unnecessary CPU load. Ensure that target assessments are only updated when meaningful
    changes occur rather than on every game tick.
