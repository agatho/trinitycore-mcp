documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a calendar event by its unique identifier from the calendar manager.
  description: The GetEvent method fetches a specific calendar event from the internal
    collection managed by CalendarMgr using the provided event ID. This method is
    commonly used when interacting with in-game calendar systems to retrieve event
    details such as title, description, time, and invitees. The returned pointer can
    be null if no event exists with the specified ID. This method does not modify
    any data and is safe for read-only access to calendar events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a CalendarEvent object if an event with the given ID exists;
    otherwise, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Event
    code: "uint64 eventId = 123456789ULL;\nCalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\n\
      if (event)\n{\n    // Process the event\n    sLog->outString(\"Found event:\
      \ %s\", event->GetTitle().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No event\
      \ found with ID: %llu\", eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal data structure, so performance
    depends on the number of events stored. It is recommended to cache event IDs when
    frequently accessed.
