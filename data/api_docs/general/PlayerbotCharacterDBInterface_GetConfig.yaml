  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: GetConfig
  signature: Config & PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::GetConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration object associated with the player bot character.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a reference to the Config object that
    holds all configuration settings for the player bot character. This configuration
    typically includes behavior parameters, decision-making rules, and other customizable
    settings that define how the bot interacts with the game world. The returned reference
    allows direct access to modify these settings at runtime. This method is commonly
    used within the player bot AI system to retrieve current configuration values
    before making decisions or executing actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the Config object containing all configuration settings
    for the player bot character. The reference provides direct access to modify configuration
    values, and should not be used after the associated PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    instance is destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Bot Configuration
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface* dbInterface = ...;

      Config& config = dbInterface->GetConfig();

      uint32 maxDistance = config.GetValue<uint32>("MaxDistanceToTarget");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Bot Behavior Settings
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface* dbInterface = ...;

      Config& config = dbInterface->GetConfig();

      config.SetValue("EnableCombat", true);

      config.SetValue("AggressionLevel", 3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Config reference is valid only as long as the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    instance remains alive. This method may involve database access or caching operations,
    so frequent calls should be avoided in performance-critical sections of code.
    The configuration object might be cached internally and changes made through the
    returned reference will affect subsequent accesses.
  warnings: Modifying the returned Config reference directly can affect other parts
    of the system that rely on these settings. Ensure thread safety if accessing this
    method from multiple threads simultaneously. Changes to configuration values may
    not take immediate effect depending on how the AI system handles configuration
    updates.
