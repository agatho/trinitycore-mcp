documentation:
  brief: Resets the AI state and clears all active AI behaviors for the unit.
  description: The Reset method in UnitAI is responsible for clearing the current
    AI state of a unit, effectively stopping any ongoing AI behaviors, resetting internal
    AI flags, and preparing the unit for a fresh AI cycle. This method is typically
    invoked when an AI-controlled unit needs to be reinitialized, such as after a
    combat reset, during zone transitions, or when switching between different AI
    states. It ensures that no stale AI data persists that could interfere with new
    AI logic execution. The method does not take any parameters and performs its operation
    on the calling UnitAI instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'UnitAI* ai = unit->GetAI();

      ai->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset During Combat Reset
    code: "void OnCombatReset(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetAI())\n        unit->GetAI()->Reset();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    AI state transitions or when a creature's AI needs to be forcefully reset. It
    should not be used in performance-critical sections of code as it may involve
    clearing internal data structures and resetting AI timers.
  warnings: Calling Reset on a unit that is currently executing complex AI logic may
    interrupt ongoing actions, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior if not
    handled carefully. Ensure that any active AI tasks are properly saved or canceled
    before invoking this method.
