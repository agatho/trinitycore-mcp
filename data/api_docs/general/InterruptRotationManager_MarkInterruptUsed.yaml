  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: MarkInterruptUsed
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::MarkInterruptUsed(int bot, uint32 timeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a bot's interrupt as used within the rotation manager.
  description: The MarkInterruptUsed method is responsible for updating the internal
    state of the InterruptRotationManager to indicate that a specific bot has utilized
    an interrupt ability. This method typically records the timestamp of when the
    interrupt was used, which can be leveraged by the AI system to manage cooldowns
    and ensure proper timing of interrupt usage during combat scenarios. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining accurate interrupt tracking for bot behavior within
    TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier or index of the bot that is using the interrupt ability.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific NPC or player-controlled character
      within the game world.
  - name: timeMs
    description: The timestamp in milliseconds when the interrupt was used. This value
      is usually obtained from the system clock and helps track when the interrupt
      became available again after usage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.MarkInterruptUsed(1, GetTickCount());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n    rotationManager.MarkInterruptUsed(botId,\
      \ time(nullptr) * 1000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever an interrupt is successfully used by
    a bot. It's important to ensure that the timeMs parameter reflects the actual
    moment of usage for accurate cooldown calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may lead to incorrect interrupt
    tracking, potentially causing bots to use interrupts too frequently or not at
    all. Ensure that bot identifiers are valid before calling this function.
