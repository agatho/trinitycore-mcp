documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the WildfireBombManager class.
  description: The WildfireBombManager constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for managing wildfire bombs within the game world.
    This method sets up default values for all member variables and prepares the manager
    to handle bomb-related events, such as spawning, updating, and removing wildfire
    bombs. The initialization process ensures that the manager is in a valid state
    before any operations are performed on it. It typically runs during the creation
    of the manager object and may perform setup tasks like registering event handlers
    or initializing internal containers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a WildfireBombManager Instance
    code: 'WildfireBombManager* manager = new WildfireBombManager();

      // The manager is now initialized and ready to manage wildfire bombs.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, implying that all configuration
    is handled internally or through other methods. It's important to ensure that
    the manager is properly initialized before calling any other methods on it to
    avoid undefined behavior.
