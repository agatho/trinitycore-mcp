documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FingersOfFrostTracker class.
  description: The FingersOfFrostTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the FingersOfFrostTracker class, which is used to track the state and effects
    of the Fingers of Frost talent in World of Warcraft. This tracker manages the
    application and removal of the frost damage buff that occurs when a player's spells
    hit enemies while the talent is active. The constructor sets up internal tracking
    variables such as the number of stacks, duration timers, and cooldown states for
    the talent's effects. It ensures proper initialization before the tracker can
    be used to monitor spell effects during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FingersOfFrostTracker instance
    code: 'FingersOfFrostTracker frostTracker;

      // The frostTracker is now initialized and ready to track Fingers of Frost effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not require any parameters as it initializes all internal
    state variables. The tracker relies on external systems (such as spell hit events)
    to update its state. It's important to note that this class is likely part of
    a larger system managing talent effects and should be properly integrated with
    the player's spell handling mechanisms.
