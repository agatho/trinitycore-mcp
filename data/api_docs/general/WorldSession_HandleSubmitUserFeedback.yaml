documentation:
  brief: Processes and submits user feedback received from a player's ticket system
    interaction.
  description: The HandleSubmitUserFeedback method is responsible for receiving and
    processing user feedback data submitted by players through the in-game ticketing
    system. This method handles the submission of feedback related to game issues,
    suggestions, or support requests. It typically validates the incoming feedback
    packet, logs the submission, and may trigger internal systems to notify game masters
    or developers about the feedback. The method is part of the WorldSession class
    which manages player connections and interactions with the server. It does not
    return any value but performs necessary operations to store or forward the user's
    feedback to appropriate channels within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: userFeedback
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Ticket::SubmitUserFeedback packet
      containing the player's feedback data, including feedback type, text content,
      and associated ticket information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSubmitUserFeedback(WorldPackets::Ticket::SubmitUserFeedback\
      \ & userFeedback)\n{\n    // Validate feedback data\n    if (userFeedback.FeedbackText.empty())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Log the feedback submission\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO,\
      \ \"Player %s submitted feedback: %s\", GetPlayer()->GetName(), userFeedback.FeedbackText.c_str());\n\
      \    \n    // Forward to ticketing system for processing\n    // Implementation\
      \ details depend on server configuration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the packet handling chain when
    a player submits feedback through the ticket interface. The actual processing
    and storage of feedback may be delegated to other systems or databases depending
    on server configuration. Developers should ensure proper validation of user input
    before processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of feedback submissions could lead to spam or abuse.
    Consider implementing rate limiting or content filtering mechanisms. Ensure that
    sensitive player data is not inadvertently exposed through feedback submissions.
