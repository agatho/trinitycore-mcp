  signature: void DeathRecoveryManager::HandleResurrectionFailed(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles resurrection failure events during player death recovery.
  description: The HandleResurrectionFailed method manages the logic when a player's
    resurrection attempt fails during the death recovery process. This method is typically
    invoked by the DeathRecoveryManager to handle cases where a player cannot be resurrected
    due to various conditions such as time limits, zone restrictions, or server-side
    limitations. It processes the failure event and may trigger appropriate notifications
    or cleanup operations for the affected player. The method operates on a time-based
    difference parameter that indicates how much time has passed since the last resurrection
    attempt.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Recovery Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Process death recovery logic\n    if\
      \ (m_player->IsDead()) {\n        m_deathRecoveryManager.HandleResurrectionFailed(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automatic death recovery system in TrinityCore.
    It should be called regularly during player update cycles to ensure proper handling
    of resurrection failures. The method likely interacts with internal timers and
    state tracking mechanisms to determine when resurrection attempts are no longer
    valid.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may result in players being unable to
    resurrect properly, leading to potential game progression issues or player frustration.
    Ensure that all related death recovery states are correctly managed before calling
    this method.
