documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided packet structure for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The Append method is used to populate a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with relevant channel-related data. This method is typically invoked when
    broadcasting channel events such as join/leave messages, mode changes, or other
    notifications to players in a specific channel. It ensures that the correct data
    structure is filled out before sending the packet over the network. The method
    operates on a const object and modifies the provided packet reference in-place.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Append to send channel notification
    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      YouLeftAppend appendObject;

      appendObject.Append(notifyPacket);

      // Packet is now populated with channel data and can be sent to players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input packet directly, so it should only be called
    when the packet is ready for population. The const qualifier indicates that the
    YouLeftAppend object itself does not change, but the packet passed in will be
    modified.
