  class: BotCustomizationGenerator
  method: GenerateCustomizations
  signature: int BotCustomizationGenerator::GenerateCustomizations(uint8 race, uint8
    gender)
documentation:
  brief: Generates customizations for a bot character based on specified race and
    gender.
  description: The GenerateCustomizations method creates randomized or predefined
    customizations for a bot character in the TrinityCore environment. It takes a
    race and gender as input parameters to determine appropriate visual attributes
    such as facial features, hair style, skin tone, and other cosmetic options. This
    method is typically used during bot creation or when resetting a bot's appearance.
    The generated customizations are applied to the bot's data structure and may influence
    how the character appears in-game. The method returns an integer status code indicating
    success or failure of the customization generation process.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race of the bot character (e.g., Human = 1, Orc = 2, Dwarf =
      3, etc.). Valid values correspond to the TrinityCore race constants defined
      in the game's database.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot character (0 = Male, 1 = Female). This parameter
      determines which set of visual customization options are selected for the bot.
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful generation of customizations,
    and non-zero values indicate various error conditions such as invalid race or
    gender parameters, internal allocation failures, or missing data in the customization
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int result = botCustomizationGenerator.GenerateCustomizations(1, 0); //\
      \ Generate male human bot customizations\nif (result == 0) {\n    printf(\"\
      Customizations generated successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to generate customizations with error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint8 race = 3; // Dwarf\nuint8 gender = 1; // Female\nint status = botCustomizationGenerator.GenerateCustomizations(race,\
      \ gender);\nswitch (status) {\n    case 0:\n        printf(\"Successfully generated\
      \ customizations for female dwarf\\n\");\n        break;\n    case -1:\n   \
      \     printf(\"Invalid race or gender specified\\n\");\n        break;\n   \
      \ default:\n        printf(\"Unknown error occurred during customization generation\\\
      n\");\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data tables containing valid customization
    options for each race and gender combination. The implementation may involve randomization
    or deterministic selection depending on the bot's configuration settings. Performance
    is generally fast but depends on database access times if customizations are fetched
    from external sources.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided race and gender values are within valid ranges
    to avoid undefined behavior. Passing invalid parameters might result in incomplete
    or incorrect customization data being applied to the bot.
