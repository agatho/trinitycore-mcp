  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeQuestRequirements
  signature: int QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeQuestRequirements(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and evaluates the requirements for a specified quest to determine
    if a bot player can accept or complete it.
  description: The AnalyzeQuestRequirements method assesses whether a given quest
    can be accepted or completed by a specified bot player. It checks various conditions
    such as level requirements, prerequisite quests, item availability, and faction
    standings. The method returns an integer code indicating the result of the analysis,
    which can be used to determine if the quest is accessible to the bot. This functionality
    is crucial for automated questing systems within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft
    servers.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to analyze. Must correspond to
      a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be evaluated
      against the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating the outcome of the analysis:

    - 0: Quest can be accepted/completed

    - Negative values: Various error conditions (e.g., invalid quest ID, missing prerequisites)

    - Positive values: Specific requirement violations or warnings'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a bot can accept a quest
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\n\
      int result = analyzer.AnalyzeQuestRequirements(questId, bot);\nif (result ==\
      \ 0) {\n    // Quest is available for the bot\n    printf(\"Quest can be accepted\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle different error conditions\n    printf(\"Quest\
      \ not available: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result codes to make decisions in automated questing
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* bot = ...;\nint analysisResult = analyzer.AnalyzeQuestRequirements(questId,\
      \ bot);\n\nswitch (analysisResult) {\ncase 0:\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance\n\
      \    bot->AddQuest(questId);\n    break;\ncase -1:\n    // Invalid quest ID\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Invalid quest ID: %u\", questId);\n    break;\ncase -2:\n\
      \    // Level requirement not met\n    sLog->outError(\"Player level too low\
      \ for quest %u\", questId);\n    break;\n// Additional cases for other error\
      \ conditions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and checks against player state, so
    it may have performance implications when called frequently. It's recommended
    to cache results where possible in automated systems. The method assumes that
    the Player object is properly initialized and represents an active bot character.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to a valid quest in the
    database; otherwise, the method will return error codes. The bot parameter must
    not be null or invalid, as this could lead to undefined behavior. This method
    does not modify the player's state directly, but its results should be used carefully
    when making decisions about quest acceptance.
