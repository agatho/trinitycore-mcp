  class: BossAI
  method: JustEngagedWith
  signature: void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(int * who)
documentation:
  brief: Called when the boss becomes engaged with a target, typically a player or
    creature.
  description: The JustEngagedWith method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a boss creature begins combat with a target entity. This method serves as
    a hook for custom AI behavior during the initial engagement phase of a boss fight.
    It allows developers to implement specific actions such as casting initial spells,
    setting up combat mechanics, or triggering events that should occur immediately
    upon engagement. The method is part of the BossAI base class and is typically
    overridden by specific boss implementations to define unique engagement behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the entity that
      triggered the engagement. This usually corresponds to a GUID or similar unique
      identifier for the engaged target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void BossGrimlok::JustEngagedWith(int* who)\n{\n    BossAI::JustEngagedWith(who);\n\
      \    DoCast(SPELL_ENRAGE);\n    Talk(SAY_AGGRO);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Engagement with Target Validation
    code: "void BossHalion::JustEngagedWith(int* who)\n{\n    BossAI::JustEngagedWith(who);\n\
      \    if (Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *who))\n    {\n       \
      \ if (target->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n        {\n            DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_FIERY_COMET);\n            events.ScheduleEvent(EVENT_FIERY_COMET, 10s);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called only once per engagement and occurs before the boss
    enters its regular combat AI loop. Developers should avoid performing heavy operations
    in this function to prevent blocking the main game thread. The 'who' parameter
    may be null or invalid if the engagement was triggered by non-unit entities.
  warnings: Do not call BossAI::JustEngagedWith directly from custom code as it may
    cause unexpected behavior. Always ensure that any overridden implementations properly
    call the parent class method to maintain AI integrity.
