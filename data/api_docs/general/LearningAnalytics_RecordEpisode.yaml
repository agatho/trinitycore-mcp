  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: RecordEpisode
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::RecordEpisode(uint32_t botGuid, uint32_t episode,
    float totalReward, float avgLoss)
documentation:
  brief: Records episode data for a bot including total reward and average loss.
  description: The RecordEpisode method logs learning analytics data for a specific
    bot during an episode of training or gameplay. It captures the bot's performance
    metrics such as total reward earned and average loss computed during that episode.
    This method is typically used in machine learning or AI-driven bot behavior systems
    within TrinityCore to track and analyze bot learning progress over time. The data
    recorded can be used for further analysis, model improvement, or performance evaluation
    of AI-controlled characters.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which episode data is being
      recorded. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: episode
    description: The episode number or iteration count for this learning session.
      Should be a positive integer representing the sequence of training episodes.
  - name: totalReward
    description: Total reward accumulated by the bot during the specified episode.
      Can be any floating-point value representing the cumulative reward signal.
  - name: avgLoss
    description: Average loss computed during the episode, used as a metric for learning
      performance. Should be a non-negative floating-point value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RecordEpisode
    code: LearningAnalytics::RecordEpisode(12345, 10, 98.5f, 0.23f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording episode data with dynamic values
    code: 'uint32_t botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      float reward = CalculateReward(player);

      float loss = ComputeLoss(model);

      LearningAnalytics::RecordEpisode(botId, currentEpisode++, reward, loss);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely stores data in an internal analytics database or logs
    for later retrieval. It may perform serialization of data to persistent storage
    depending on implementation. Developers should ensure that botGuid refers to a
    valid bot entity before calling this function to avoid invalid data entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid botGuid values may result in data corruption
    or failed writes to the analytics system. Ensure all parameters are validated
    before passing them to this method, especially totalReward and avgLoss which should
    be meaningful numerical values.
