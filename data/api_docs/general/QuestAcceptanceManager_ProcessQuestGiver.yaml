documentation:
  brief: Processes a quest giver object to handle quest acceptance and related interactions.
  description: The ProcessQuestGiver method in the QuestAcceptanceManager class is
    responsible for managing the interaction between a player and a quest giver (such
    as an NPC) when accepting or interacting with quests. This method typically validates
    the quest giver's state, checks if the player meets the prerequisites for accepting
    the quest, and updates the player's quest log accordingly. It may also trigger
    related events or notifications within the game world to reflect the successful
    quest acceptance.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest giver's identifier or
      internal reference. This value is used to locate and process the specific quest
      giver object in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Giver Processing
    code: 'int questGiverId = 12345;

      QuestAcceptanceManager manager;

      manager.ProcessQuestGiver(&questGiverId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest giver pointer is valid and points to an
    existing quest giver object in the game world. It may internally perform checks
    for quest availability, player level requirements, and prerequisite conditions
    before proceeding with quest acceptance.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid questGiver pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the quest giver exists and is properly initialized before
    calling this method.
