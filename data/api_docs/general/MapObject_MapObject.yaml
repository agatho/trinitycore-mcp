documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MapObject instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The MapObject constructor initializes a new instance of the MapObject
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values required for
    the object to function properly within the TrinityCore game world. This method
    is typically called automatically when creating new MapObject instances, and it
    ensures that all necessary member variables are properly initialized before the
    object can be used in gameplay mechanics such as movement, interaction, or spatial
    queries. The constructor does not accept any parameters and performs essential
    setup operations including initializing object identifiers, position data, and
    other core properties needed for integration with the map system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MapObject instance
    code: 'MapObject* obj = new MapObject();

      // The object is now initialized and ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically invoked when creating MapObject instances
    through standard C++ object creation syntax. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless implementing custom object creation logic or inheritance
    patterns. The initialization process includes setting up internal state that is
    critical for proper object behavior in TrinityCore's map and spatial systems.
