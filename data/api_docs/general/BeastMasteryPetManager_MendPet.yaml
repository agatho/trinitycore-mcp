documentation:
  brief: Heals and restores health of the player's beast mastery pet.
  description: The MendPet method is responsible for restoring health to a player's
    pet that is under the Beast Mastery specialization. This function typically activates
    when the player uses the Mend Pet ability, which is a core part of the Hunter's
    pet management system in World of Warcraft. The method ensures that the pet's
    health is replenished according to the game mechanics and player's level, while
    also potentially consuming mana or other resources as defined by the spell's implementation.
    It directly interacts with the pet's health system and may trigger visual effects
    or animations associated with healing.

  - title: Basic usage of MendPet
    code: 'BeastMasteryPetManager petManager;

      petManager.MendPet();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the underlying pet management system and
    may require the pet to be within a certain range or in a specific state (e.g.,
    not dead) for the healing effect to occur. It is typically called as part of a
    spell activation sequence triggered by player input.
  warnings: Improper usage or calling this method when no valid pet exists may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the player has an active pet before
    invoking this method.
