  class: LFGMgr
  method: DumpQueueInfo
  signature: std::string LFGMgr::DumpQueueInfo(bool full)
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a formatted string containing detailed information
    about the current LFG queue state.
  description: The DumpQueueInfo method retrieves comprehensive data about all active
    LFG (Looking For Group) queues within the TrinityCore instance. It compiles information
    including player GUIDs, group compositions, dungeon IDs, queue times, and other
    relevant metadata for each queued player or group. This method is primarily used
    for debugging, monitoring, or administrative purposes to inspect the current state
    of the LFG system. The output string can be either minimal or full detail depending
    on the 'full' parameter value.
  parameters:
  - name: full
    description: When set to true, includes detailed queue information such as player
      roles, class data, and extended metadata. When false, returns a concise summary
      of active queues.
  returns: A std::string containing formatted queue information. The string includes
    details about each queued group or player including GUIDs, dungeon IDs, queue
    times, and optionally role/class data if the 'full' parameter is enabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get minimal queue info
    code: 'std::string queueInfo = sLFGMgr->DumpQueueInfo(false);

      // Returns concise summary of all active LFG queues

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "LFG Queue Info: %s", queueInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Full queue information for debugging purposes
    code: 'std::string fullQueueInfo = sLFGMgr->DumpQueueInfo(true);

      // Returns detailed breakdown of all queued players and groups

      TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Detailed LFG Queue Info:\n%s", fullQueueInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debug or admin commands to inspect the internal
    state of the LFG system. It may generate large output strings when called with
    'full=true' on busy servers with many active queues.
