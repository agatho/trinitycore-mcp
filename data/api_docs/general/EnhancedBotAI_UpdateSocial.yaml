documentation:
  brief: Updates the social behavior and interactions of enhanced bot AI entities
    within the game world.
  description: The UpdateSocial method is responsible for managing and updating the
    social dynamics of enhanced bots in TrinityCore. This method processes various
    social states, relationship statuses, and interaction behaviors that define how
    bots communicate and behave in relation to other players and NPCs. It typically
    handles cooldowns, social message queues, friendship/neutral/enemy status updates,
    and triggers appropriate AI responses based on social context. The method is called
    regularly by the game loop to ensure that bot social behavior remains dynamic
    and realistic. This functionality is crucial for creating immersive gameplay experiences
    where bots can form meaningful relationships with players.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& bot : m_enhancedBots)\n\
      \    {\n        bot->GetAI()->UpdateSocial(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main game update loop with
    a delta time parameter. It may perform database operations to persist social state
    changes, and should be called frequently enough to maintain responsive social
    behavior. The implementation likely includes optimizations to avoid processing
    bots that are currently inactive or in non-social states.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to bots appearing unresponsive
    or behaving erratically in social situations. Care must be taken to ensure that
    social updates don't block the main game thread for extended periods, as this
    could impact overall server performance.
