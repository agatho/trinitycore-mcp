  class: Battleground
  method: GetStartDelayTime
  signature: int Battleground::GetStartDelayTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the start delay time of the battleground in milliseconds.
  description: The GetStartDelayTime method retrieves the duration, in milliseconds,
    that a battleground will wait before beginning after all players have joined.
    This delay is typically used to allow players to prepare themselves for combat,
    such as by checking their gear or positioning. The value returned represents the
    time interval between the moment when the last player joins the battleground and
    when the actual match begins. This method is commonly used in battleground initialization
    logic and can be influenced by various game settings and battleground types.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the start delay time in milliseconds. A value of
    0 typically indicates no delay, while positive values indicate the number of milliseconds
    to wait before starting the battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check battleground start delay
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int delay = bg->GetStartDelayTime();

      printf("Battleground start delay: %d ms\n", delay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core battleground lifecycle management and may
    return different values depending on the specific battleground type (e.g., Warsong
    Gulch, Arathi Basin). The delay value is usually configured in the game's battleground
    templates or settings.
