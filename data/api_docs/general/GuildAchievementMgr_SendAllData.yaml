  method: SendAllData
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendAllData(const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all guild achievement data to the specified player.
  description: The SendAllData method is responsible for transmitting complete guild
    achievement information to a given player client. This method is typically invoked
    when a player joins a guild or when their guild achievement data needs to be refreshed
    in their client. It ensures that the player's UI displays up-to-date information
    about all achievements earned by their guild, including progress tracking and
    completion status. The method operates on the GuildAchievementMgr instance and
    sends the data through the network layer to the specified receiver.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the guild achievement
      data. This parameter must not be null and should represent an active player
      connected to the server.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Sending guild achievements to a player upon joining
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterGuild(Player* player, Guild* guild)\n{\n    if (guild\
      \ && player)\n    {\n        GuildAchievementMgr* mgr = guild->GetAchievementMgr();\n\
      \        if (mgr)\n        {\n            mgr->SendAllData(player);\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely serializes achievement data and sends it via a network
    packet to the client. It may involve iterating through all achievements in the
    guild's database and formatting them for transmission. The method should only
    be called when the receiver is connected and authenticated.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null receiver pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is valid and connected before
    invoking this method.
