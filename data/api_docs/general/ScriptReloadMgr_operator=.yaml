  brief: Moves the contents of another ScriptReloadMgr instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for ScriptReloadMgr transfers all resources
    and state from the source ScriptReloadMgr object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used when reassigning a ScriptReloadMgr instance to another, allowing
    efficient resource management by transferring ownership rather than copying data.
    The method ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state
    after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this
    operator supports efficient management of script reloading mechanisms without
    unnecessary duplication of internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current ScriptReloadMgr instance, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'ScriptReloadMgr manager1;

      ScriptReloadMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move assignment operator that follows C++ move semantics. It's
    designed to be efficient and avoid deep copying of internal data structures. The
    source object should not be used after the move operation as its state becomes
    undefined but valid.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper usage patterns are followed to prevent resource leaks
    or corruption.
