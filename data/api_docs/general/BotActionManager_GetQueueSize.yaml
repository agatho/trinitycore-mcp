  class: BotActionManager
  method: GetQueueSize
  signature: size_t BotActionManager::GetQueueSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of queued bot actions in the manager's action
    queue.
  description: The GetQueueSize method retrieves the total count of bot actions currently
    waiting in the queue for processing. This method is typically used to monitor
    the workload of the bot action manager, which handles various automated behaviors
    such as movement, casting spells, or interacting with game objects. The returned
    size indicates how many actions are pending execution and can be useful for performance
    tuning, debugging, or determining when to trigger additional bot logic. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of actions currently queued for
    processing by the BotActionManager. Returns zero if no actions are queued.
  examples:
  - title: Check Queue Size Before Adding Action
    code: "BotActionManager* actionManager = player->GetBotActionManager();\nsize_t\
      \ currentQueueSize = actionManager->GetQueueSize();\nif (currentQueueSize <\
      \ MAX_QUEUED_ACTIONS)\n{\n    // Add new bot action\n    actionManager->AddAction(new\
      \ BotMoveAction(targetPos));\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor Queue for Performance Issues
    code: "void CheckBotQueueStatus(Player* player)\n{\n    BotActionManager* manager\
      \ = player->GetBotActionManager();\n    size_t queueSize = manager->GetQueueSize();\n\
      \    if (queueSize > HIGH_QUEUE_THRESHOLD)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Bot queue size is %zu, may cause performance issues\", queueSize);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter and has
    minimal performance overhead. The queue size may change between the time it's
    queried and when subsequent actions are taken, so results should be treated as
    approximate snapshots.
