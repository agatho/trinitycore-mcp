  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CanMoveToPosition
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CanMoveToPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit can move to a specified position based on line
    of sight and collision detection.
  description: The CanMoveToPosition method evaluates whether a unit is able to navigate
    to a given location without obstruction. It performs checks for line of sight
    clearance, collision detection, and other movement-related constraints within
    the game world. This method is typically used by AI systems or movement logic
    to validate potential paths before executing them. The result indicates whether
    the path to the target position is clear and traversable.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The target position to check for movement validity. This parameter
      represents a coordinate in the game world that the unit might attempt to move
      toward.
  returns: Returns true if the unit can successfully move to the specified position,
    considering all relevant movement constraints and line of sight requirements;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.CanMoveToPosition(targetPosition)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement logic\n    unit->MoveTo(targetPosition);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ blocked path\n    unit->SetMovementState(MOVEMENT_STATE_BLOCKED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs expensive calculations involving raycasting and
    collision detection. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical code
    paths, especially when checking many positions per frame. The implementation may
    cache certain results or use spatial partitioning for optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter is valid and within the bounds of the
    current map to avoid undefined behavior. Calling this method with invalid coordinates
    might lead to incorrect results or crashes in edge cases.
