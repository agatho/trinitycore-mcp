  class: MoveSpline
  method: HasStarted
  signature: bool MoveSpline::HasStarted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spline movement has begun.
  description: The HasStarted method checks if a MoveSpline object has begun executing
    its movement path. This is typically used to verify that a character or object
    has started moving along a defined spline route, which may be initiated through
    various game mechanics such as NPC movement, player teleportation, or spell effects.
    The method returns true once the spline's initial movement state is set and false
    before any movement has commenced. This check is essential for ensuring proper
    synchronization of movement-related events and animations in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spline movement has started and false if it has not
    yet begun. The return value indicates whether the internal state of the MoveSpline
    object reflects an active movement process.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Movement Has Started
    code: "if (spline->HasStarted()) {\n    // Movement is in progress\n    // Perform\
      \ actions that depend on active movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Movement State
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player) {\n    if (!spline->HasStarted())\
      \ {\n        // Start the movement\n        spline->Launch();\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Movement already in progress\n        // Update related systems\
      \ or check for completion\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other MoveSpline state
    management functions to ensure proper movement lifecycle handling. It's important
    to note that a spline may be initialized but not yet started, particularly when
    using asynchronous movement initiation methods.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method for critical game logic, as movement
    states can change rapidly during complex animations or server-side processing.
    Ensure proper synchronization if checking this value in multithreaded contexts.
