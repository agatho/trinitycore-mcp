  signature: int BotAI::GetBotGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance.
  description: The GetBotGuid method retrieves the globally unique identifier assigned
    to a specific bot instance within the TrinityCore framework. This GUID is used
    internally by the game engine to uniquely identify and reference the bot across
    various systems, including AI processing, player interactions, and database operations.
    The returned value represents a 32-bit integer that serves as the primary key
    for identifying this particular bot in the system. This method is typically called
    during bot initialization, AI decision-making processes, or when interfacing with
    other subsystems that require a unique reference to the bot entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance.
    This GUID is a 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies this specific bot
    within the game world and database systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...; // Assume bot AI instance is initialized

      int botGuid = botAI->GetBotGuid();

      // Use botGuid for further operations like database lookups or AI logic

      printf("Bot GUID: %d\n", botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is assigned during the bot's creation process
    and remains constant throughout its lifetime. This value should not be modified
    or used to directly manipulate the bot's internal state. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from a stored member variable.
