  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: AddZone
  signature: void BattlefieldMgr::AddZone(int zoneId, Battlefield * bf)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a battlefield instance with a specific zone ID in the battlefield
    management system.
  description: The AddZone method associates a Battlefield instance with a given zone
    identifier within the BattlefieldMgr subsystem. This allows the game to properly
    manage and dispatch players to the correct battlefield based on their current
    zone. The method is typically called during server initialization or when a new
    battlefield is created and needs to be linked to its corresponding zone. It ensures
    that zone-based battlefield events and player movement are correctly handled by
    the system.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone that will be associated with the
      battlefield instance. This ID must correspond to a valid zone in the game world.
  - name: bf
    description: Pointer to the Battlefield instance that should be linked to the
      specified zone. Must not be null and should represent a valid battlefield object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = new Battlefield();

      bf->SetZoneId(1234);

      battlefieldMgr->AddZone(1234, bf);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the Battlefield object has been properly
    initialized and configured. The zone ID must be unique within the system to prevent
    conflicts. The Battlefield instance pointed to by 'bf' must remain valid for the
    duration of its association with the zone.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for 'bf' will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the zoneId is valid and corresponds to an existing
    zone before calling this method.
