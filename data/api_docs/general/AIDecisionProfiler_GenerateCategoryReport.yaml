  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GenerateCategoryReport
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::GenerateCategoryReport(std::string & report,
    AIDecisionCategory category) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed performance report for a specified AI decision category.
  description: The GenerateCategoryReport method produces a formatted string containing
    performance metrics and statistics for a given AI decision category. This method
    is typically used for debugging and optimization purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework, allowing developers to analyze how different AI decision-making processes
    are performing in terms of execution time, frequency, and other relevant metrics.
    The report includes data about decision processing times, call counts, and potentially
    memory usage for each category. It's designed to be called during development
    or testing phases to identify performance bottlenecks in the AI subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a std::string where the generated report will be stored.
      The method populates this string with formatted performance data.
  - name: category
    description: An AIDecisionCategory enum value that specifies which AI decision
      category's report should be generated. This determines what subset of AI decisions
      are analyzed and reported on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to generate a report for movement decisions
    code: 'std::string report;

      AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.GenerateCategoryReport(report, AIDecisionCategory::MOVEMENT);

      // ''report'' now contains the formatted performance data for movement decisions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating reports for all AI categories in a loop
    code: "std::vector<AIDecisionCategory> categories = {AIDecisionCategory::MOVEMENT,\
      \ AIDecisionCategory::COMBAT, AIDecisionCategory::TARGETING};\nfor (auto category\
      \ : categories) {\n    std::string report;\n    profiler.GenerateCategoryReport(report,\
      \ category);\n    // Log or process the report for each category\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and performance analysis.
    The generated reports may include timing information that reflects actual runtime
    behavior, so results can vary between different server loads or execution environments.
    Ensure that profiling data collection is enabled in the TrinityCore configuration
    to get meaningful reports.
  warnings: The method modifies the provided report string directly, so ensure it's
    properly initialized before calling. Calling this method frequently during high-traffic
    periods may introduce performance overhead due to formatting and data aggregation
    operations.
