  class: AreaTrigger
  method: _UpdateDuration
  signature: void AreaTrigger::_UpdateDuration(int32 newDuration)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the duration of an area trigger, adjusting its active time remaining.
  description: The _UpdateDuration method modifies the remaining time before an area
    trigger expires. This internal method is typically called when the trigger's duration
    needs to be extended or shortened based on game events, player interactions, or
    spell effects. The method directly manipulates the area trigger's internal timer
    state, potentially affecting when the trigger will be removed from the world.
    It is designed for use within the core TrinityCore systems and should not be invoked
    directly by external code without proper context.
  parameters:
  - name: newDuration
    description: The new duration value in milliseconds to set for the area trigger.
      Positive values extend the trigger's lifetime, while negative values may cause
      immediate expiration or other undefined behavior depending on implementation
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Extending Area Trigger Duration
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->_UpdateDuration(5000); // Extend duration by 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Immediate Expiration
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->_UpdateDuration(-1); // Immediately expire the trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should only be called from within the TrinityCore
    core systems. The method directly modifies the area trigger's timer without any
    validation checks, so callers must ensure the new duration value is appropriate
    for the context. It may affect performance if called frequently on many triggers
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method outside of core systems can lead to undefined
    behavior or game state corruption. Never call this method with invalid duration
    values unless you fully understand the internal trigger lifecycle management.
    Improper use may cause triggers to not expire correctly or cause memory leaks.
