  signature: void CategoryMemoryStats::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all memory statistics for the category to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated memory usage data within the
    CategoryMemoryStats object, restoring all counters and measurements to their default
    zero values. This method is typically used during system initialization or when
    memory profiling needs to be restarted with a clean slate. The operation is atomic
    and ensures that subsequent memory tracking will begin from a known baseline state.
    No parameters are required as the reset affects the entire internal state of the
    object.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CategoryMemoryStats stats;

      // ... perform some memory operations ...

      stats.Reset(); // Reset all collected statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve clearing internal data structures. It is recommended to use this
    during system startup or when explicitly resetting profiling sessions.
