  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: ExecuteTransition
  signature: void GroupStateMachine::ExecuteTransition(GroupState newState, GroupStateTransition
    transition)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a state transition for a group within the GroupStateMachine.
  description: The ExecuteTransition method performs a state change in the GroupStateMachine
    by applying the specified new state and transition. This method is typically used
    to manage group states such as leader changes, member additions or removals, and
    other group-related events. The method ensures that transitions follow valid state
    machine rules and updates internal group state accordingly. It may trigger additional
    actions like sending notifications to group members or updating group data in
    the database.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target state to transition the group into. Must be a valid GroupState
      enum value representing the desired group state such as GROUP_STATE_NONE, GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE,
      GROUP_STATE_INACTIVE, etc.
  - name: transition
    description: The type of transition being executed. This parameter defines the
      context of the state change, such as GROUP_TRANSITION_LEADER_CHANGE, GROUP_TRANSITION_MEMBER_JOIN,
      GROUP_TRANSITION_MEMBER_LEAVE, or other valid GroupStateTransition enum values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic group state transition
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupState newState = GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE;

      GroupStateTransition transition = GROUP_TRANSITION_MEMBER_JOIN;

      stateMachine.ExecuteTransition(newState, transition);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Leader change transition
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupState newState = GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE;

      GroupStateTransition transition = GROUP_TRANSITION_LEADER_CHANGE;

      stateMachine.ExecuteTransition(newState, transition);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system.
    Developers should ensure that the provided state and transition values are valid
    to prevent undefined behavior. The implementation may involve database updates
    and network communication with group members.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GroupState or GroupStateTransition values
    may result in unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of input
    parameters before calling this method.
