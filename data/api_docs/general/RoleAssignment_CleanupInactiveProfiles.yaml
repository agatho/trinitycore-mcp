    This method helps maintain database cleanliness and performance by eliminating
    stale data. It typically checks profile activity timestamps and removes entries
    that exceed the configured inactivity threshold. The cleanup process may involve
    database operations to delete orphaned records and ensure referential integrity.

  notes: This method should be called periodically as part of routine maintenance
    tasks. It's recommended to run this during low-traffic periods to minimize impact
    on performance. The inactivity threshold is typically configurable through server
    settings.
  warnings: Calling this method may result in loss of historical role assignment data
    for inactive users. Ensure proper backup procedures are in place before running
    cleanup operations.
