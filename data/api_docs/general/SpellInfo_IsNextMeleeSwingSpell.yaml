documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is the next melee swing spell in the combat
    queue.
  description: This method checks if the current SpellInfo object represents the next
    melee swing spell that will be executed during combat. It is commonly used in
    the context of melee attacks and auto-attacks sequences, particularly when determining
    if a spell should be executed as part of the next melee swing. The method returns
    true if the spell is designated as the next melee swing spell, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for managing combat behavior and ensuring proper
    execution of melee attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is the next melee swing spell in the combat queue,
    false otherwise. The method does not return null or error values as it is a boolean
    check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsNextMeleeSwingSpell()) {\n    // Execute melee attack\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal spell flags or
    combat-related properties to determine if the spell is designated as the next
    melee swing. Performance considerations: Since this is a simple boolean check,
    it should not impact performance significantly. Thread safety: This method is
    thread-safe as it only reads immutable data.'
  warnings: 'This method may not be reliable in all combat scenarios as it depends
    on specific spell properties and may not always accurately reflect the actual
    next melee swing spell. Common mistake: Using this method without understanding
    its relationship to combat sequence logic can lead to incorrect execution of melee
    attacks.'
