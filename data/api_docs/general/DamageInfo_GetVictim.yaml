  signature: int * DamageInfo::GetVictim() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the victim's unique identifier (GUID) associated with
    the damage information.
  description: The GetVictim method retrieves a pointer to the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the target entity that is receiving damage. This GUID is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to uniquely identify game objects such
    as players, creatures, or game objects. The returned pointer may be null if no
    victim is set or if the damage information has not been properly initialized.
    In the context of combat mechanics, this method allows access to the entity that
    is being damaged by a specific DamageInfo instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the victim. Returns nullptr
    if no victim is set or if the damage info is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();\nint* victimGuid = damageInfo->GetVictim();\n\
      if (victimGuid != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Victim GUID: \" << *victimGuid\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No victim set.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat System Integration
    code: "void HandleDamage(DamageInfo* damageInfo) {\n    int* victimGuid = damageInfo->GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (victimGuid != nullptr && *victimGuid > 0) {\n        // Process damage\
      \ against the victim\n        Unit* victim = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*victimGuid);\n\
      \        if (victim) {\n            victim->DealDamage(damageInfo);\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a raw pointer to an integer, which represents the GUID
    of the victim. Developers should ensure that the DamageInfo object is properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The returned
    pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal data within the
    DamageInfo instance.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer is always valid. Always check
    for null before dereferencing. Modifying the value pointed to by the return value
    can lead to undefined behavior and corruption of internal state.
