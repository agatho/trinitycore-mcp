api:
  class: QuestStrategy
  method: NavigateToQuestEnder
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::NavigateToQuestEnder(BotAI * ai, const QuestEnderLocation
    & location)
documentation:
  brief: Navigates the bot to the quest ender location using the provided AI context.
  description: The NavigateToQuestEnder method is responsible for guiding a bot character
    to a specific quest ender location within the World of Warcraft environment. This
    method utilizes the provided BotAI instance to determine movement strategies and
    pathfinding logic. It typically involves calculating the optimal route to the
    destination, handling potential obstacles, and ensuring the bot reaches the specified
    location accurately. The method is commonly used in automated quest completion
    systems where bots need to interact with quest givers or objects to progress through
    quests.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot's behavior and
      decision-making process during navigation.
  - name: location
    description: Reference to a QuestEnderLocation structure containing coordinates
      and other relevant data about where the quest ender is located.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully navigated to the quest ender location,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to navigation failure, invalid
    location data, or inability to reach the destination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation Example
    code: "QuestEnderLocation enderLoc;\nenderLoc.x = 1234.5f;\nenderLoc.y = 6789.0f;\n\
      enderLoc.z = 100.0f;\n\nif (strategy.NavigateToQuestEnder(ai, enderLoc)) {\n\
      \    // Bot reached the quest ender\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"Successfully reached\
      \ quest ender.\");\n} else {\n    // Navigation failed\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"\
      Failed to reach quest ender.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the underlying BotAI implementation for pathfinding
    and movement logic. Performance may be affected by complex terrain or crowded
    areas where navigation is challenging. The method assumes that the QuestEnderLocation
    data is valid and accessible.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided BotAI instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as an uninitialized AI could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, verify that the location coordinates are within valid game boundaries to
    prevent navigation errors.
