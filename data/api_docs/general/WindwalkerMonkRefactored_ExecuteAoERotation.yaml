  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Windwalker Monk's AoE rotation logic based on enemy count and
    target selection.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a Windwalker
    Monk's area of effect combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat scenario,
    including the number of enemies present and the selected target, to determine
    the optimal sequence of abilities and spells to maximize damage output or survivability.
    This method is typically invoked during combat situations where multiple enemies
    are present, and it utilizes the monk's signature abilities such as Spinning Crane
    Kick, Rushing Jade Wind, and other AoE talents. The method modifies the AI behavior
    based on enemy proximity, player resource levels (chi, energy), and cooldown states
    to ensure efficient and effective multi-target engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      primary target in the combat environment. This value is used to determine targeting
      priority and spell placement for AoE abilities.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      within the monk's attack range. This parameter directly influences ability selection
      and rotation prioritization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int primaryTarget = 0;

      uint32 numEnemies = 5;

      monk->ExecuteAoERotation(&primaryTarget, numEnemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Selection with AoE Rotation
    code: 'int* target = &player->GetSelectedUnit()->GetGUID();

      uint32 enemiesInRange = player->GetThreatManager().GetThreatListSize();

      monk->ExecuteAoERotation(target, enemiesInRange);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the monk is in combat and has valid targets. The
    implementation may internally check for sufficient chi or energy before executing
    certain abilities. It's recommended to call this function only when the AI is
    actively engaged in combat with multiple enemies.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to a legitimate enemy
    unit before calling this method, as invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that this method does not handle movement or positioning logic;
    it focuses purely on ability execution.
