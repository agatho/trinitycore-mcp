  method: Reset
  signature: void EnhancedAIStats::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics and counters within the EnhancedAIStats instance to
    their initial default values.
  description: The Reset method clears and reinitializes all internal statistics and
    counters maintained by the EnhancedAIStats class. This function is typically invoked
    when a creature's AI behavior needs to be restarted or when resetting performance
    tracking data. It ensures that all accumulated metrics, such as attack counts,
    movement distances, or interaction timestamps, are cleared and set back to their
    baseline state. The method does not require any input parameters and performs
    no return operations. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate
    AI performance monitoring and preventing data leakage between different AI sessions
    or combat encounters.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'EnhancedAIStats stats;

      // ... perform some AI operations ...

      stats.Reset(); // Reset all tracked statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during AI state transitions to avoid
    losing important tracking data that might be needed for debugging or performance
    analysis. The reset operation is atomic and does not involve any external dependencies.
