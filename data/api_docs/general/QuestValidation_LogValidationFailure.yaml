  signature: void QuestValidation::LogValidationFailure(uint32 questId, Player * bot,
    const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a quest validation failure with associated quest ID, player, and reason.
  description: The LogValidationFailure method records information about a quest validation
    failure within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a quest identifier, a pointer
    to the player involved, and a descriptive reason for the failure. This function
    is typically used during quest validation processes to track and debug issues
    with quest completion or acceptance. The logged data can be used for administrative
    purposes, debugging, or monitoring quest-related anomalies in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that failed validation. Must be
      a valid quest ID registered in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object associated with the validation failure.
      Should not be null and must represent an active player in the game world.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the quest validation failed.
      This should provide enough context for developers or administrators to understand
      the issue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LogValidationFailure
    code: QuestValidation::LogValidationFailure(12345, player, "Player does not meet
      level requirement");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely writes to a log file or database table for tracking quest
    validation issues. It's important that the questId is valid and the player pointer
    points to an actual in-game character to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, make sure that the questId exists in
    the database to maintain data integrity.
