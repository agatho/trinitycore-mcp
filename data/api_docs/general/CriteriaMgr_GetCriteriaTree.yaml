documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a criteria tree by its unique identifier from the criteria manager.
  description: The GetCriteriaTree method fetches a const pointer to a CriteriaTree
    object associated with the specified criteria tree ID. This method is used within
    the TrinityCore framework to access predefined criteria structures that define
    achievements, quests, or other in-game progression requirements. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the CriteriaMgr instance remains alive and the
    criteria tree has not been removed from memory. It's commonly used during achievement
    evaluation, quest progress tracking, and related gameplay logic where specific
    criterion conditions need to be checked against player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the CriteriaTree object if a valid criteria tree with
    the given ID exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such criteria tree is found
    in the manager's internal data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Criteria Tree
    code: "const CriteriaTree* tree = criteriaMgr->GetCriteriaTree(12345);\nif (tree\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the criteria tree for achievement validation or\
      \ similar logic\n    printf(\"Found criteria tree with ID: %u\\n\", tree->ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using an internal map or container,
    so repeated calls with the same ID may have performance implications if not cached.
    The returned pointer should never be modified directly as it points to read-only
    data managed by the CriteriaMgr.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the criteria tree is
    fully initialized or valid for use in all contexts. Always verify that the tree
    contains expected child criteria nodes before attempting to iterate through them.
