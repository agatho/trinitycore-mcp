  method: CreateEcho
  signature: void EchoController::CreateEcho(int * target, int healAmount, int numHeals)
documentation:
  brief: Creates an echo effect that applies healing to a target multiple times.
  description: The CreateEcho method generates a healing echo effect that targets
    a specified unit and applies a given amount of healing a set number of times.
    This method is typically used in spell or ability implementations where an effect
    needs to be replicated or amplified. The target parameter points to the unit that
    will receive the healing, while healAmount determines how much healing is applied
    per instance, and numHeals specifies how many times the healing should be applied.
    This functionality is commonly seen in abilities that create multiple healing
    instances or echoes of a primary effect.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      Must point to a valid unit within the game world, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: healAmount
    description: Integer value specifying the amount of healing to be applied with
      each echo instance. Should be a positive value representing the healing magnitude.
  - name: numHeals
    description: Integer value indicating how many times the healing effect should
      be applied. Must be a positive integer, typically limited by game mechanics
      or spell restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Echo Healing Example
    code: 'int targetId = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      int healAmount = 100;

      int numHeals = 3;

      controller->CreateEcho(&targetId, healAmount, numHeals);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Echo with Dynamic Values
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      int healAmount = 50 + (player->GetLevel() * 2);

      int numHeals = std::min(5, player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_MAX_TALENTS));

      controller->CreateEcho(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), healAmount, numHeals);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible within the
    current game context. The healing effect may be subject to game rules such as
    maximum healing limits, target restrictions, or spell cooldowns. Implementation
    may involve multiple internal calls to apply healing effects sequentially.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null target pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target unit exists and is valid before calling this
    method. The numHeals parameter should be carefully controlled to prevent excessive
    resource consumption or game balance issues.
