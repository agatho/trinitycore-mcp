  class: KitingManager
  method: ValidateKitingPath
  signature: bool KitingManager::ValidateKitingPath(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the current kiting path is safe and compliant with game
    mechanics.
  description: The ValidateKitingPath method checks if the player's current kiting
    path is valid according to TrinityCore's kiting mechanics. It evaluates factors
    such as movement constraints, collision detection, and adherence to allowed travel
    routes. This method ensures that players are not exploiting kiting mechanics in
    ways that could disrupt gameplay balance or violate server rules. The validation
    typically occurs during movement updates and helps maintain fair play conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the kiting path is valid and compliant with game mechanics,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as invalid waypoints,
    collision with obstacles, or violation of kiting rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement handler
    code: "if (kitingManager.ValidateKitingPath()) {\n    // Proceed with kiting movement\n\
      \    player->MovePlayer();\n} else {\n    // Cancel or correct the kiting path\n\
      \    player->StopMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement updates and may have performance
    implications if used excessively. The validation process considers various factors
    including player speed, waypoint distances, and environmental obstacles.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of movement contexts as it may lead to
    inconsistent behavior or incorrect validation results. Ensure that waypoints are
    properly initialized before calling this method.
