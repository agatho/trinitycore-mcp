    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotCharacterSelector object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotCharacterSelector class performs
    a deep copy of all member variables from the source object to the target object.
    This method is typically used when duplicating bot character selection configurations
    or transferring selection criteria between different instances. The operation
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data, preventing
    unintended side effects from shared references. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this allows for flexible configuration management where one selector
    can be easily copied to another for reuse or modification.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotCharacterSelector object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotCharacterSelector object (this), allowing
    for chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector1;

      BotCharacterSelector selector2 = selector1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      selector2 = selector1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector1, selector2, selector3;

      // Configure selector1...

      selector2 = selector1; // Assign to selector2

      selector3 = selector2; // Assign to selector3 (chaining)

      // Now selector1, selector2, and selector3 are all independent copies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy mechanism to ensure that internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. The implementation should handle any
    dynamically allocated memory or complex member objects appropriately to avoid
    memory leaks or dangling pointers.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with large data structures as it
    may involve significant memory allocation and copying operations. Ensure that
    the source object is in a valid state before assignment to prevent undefined behavior.
