  brief: Determines whether a spell is available to the player based on class and
    race requirements
  description: This method checks if a specific spell is compatible with the player's
    current class and race. It evaluates whether the spell can be learned or used
    by the player given their character's class and race restrictions. The function
    returns true if the spell fits the player's class and race requirements, false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for validating spell learning conditions
    and ensuring proper gameplay mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is available to the player based on class and
    race requirements; false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsSpellFitByClassAndRace(12345)) {\n    // Spell can be learned\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Spell cannot be learned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation likely involves checking spell requirements against player's
    class and race data. Performance considerations may arise from frequent calls
    during spell validation processes.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining spell availability in isolation;
    other factors like level requirements, skill requirements, and quest prerequisites
    must also be considered for complete spell validation.
