  brief: Moves a MovementGenerator object to another MovementGenerator object using
    move semantics.
  description: The MovementGenerator constructor that accepts an rvalue reference
    to another MovementGenerator is used for move construction. This allows efficient
    transfer of resources from one MovementGenerator instance to another, avoiding
    unnecessary copying. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and movement system, this
    is typically used when transferring ownership of movement behaviors or generators
    between objects. The operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified
    state, as is standard with move semantics in C++. This constructor is part of
    the standard C++ move semantics pattern and is essential for efficient resource
    management in systems that frequently create and destroy movement generators.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another MovementGenerator object. This parameter
      represents the source object whose resources will be moved to this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a MovementGenerator
    code: 'MovementGenerator generator1;

      // ... some operations on generator1 ...

      MovementGenerator generator2 = std::move(generator1); // Move constructor invoked
      here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<MovementGenerator> generators;

      generators.emplace_back();

      // ... populate generators ...

      MovementGenerator newGen = std::move(generators.back()); // Efficiently move
      last element

      generators.pop_back();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the C++ standard move semantics. It should only
    be called with an rvalue reference to avoid unintended copying. After a successful
    move, the source object's state is valid but unspecified. This is commonly used
    in performance-critical code paths where avoiding copies of large objects is important.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor with lvalue expressions as it will not compile
    due to type mismatch. The source object becomes left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the move operation, so avoid using it afterward unless explicitly
    reinitializing.
