  method: IsMarketDominated
  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::IsMarketDominated(uint32 itemId, float threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a market item is dominated by a single vendor or faction
    above a given threshold.
  description: The IsMarketDominated method evaluates if a specific item in the game's
    market is controlled or priced dominantly by one vendor or faction. It compares
    the price of the item against a defined threshold to determine if it's considered
    'dominated'. This functionality is typically used for market analysis, pricing
    strategies, and identifying monopolistic behaviors within the auction house system.
    The method likely checks internal market data structures such as vendor listings,
    item prices, and supply/demand ratios to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being analyzed in the market. This
      corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry ID used by TrinityCore's database.
  - name: threshold
    description: A float value representing the percentage threshold above which an
      item is considered 'dominated'. For example, a threshold of 0.75 means if one
      vendor or faction controls more than 75% of the market for that item, it will
      return true.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is dominated by a single vendor or faction
    above the given threshold; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (marketAnalysis.IsMarketDominated(18732, 0.6f)) {\n    // Item 18732\
      \ is dominated by one vendor/faction above 60%\n    sLog->outString(\"Item %u\
      \ is market dominated.\", 18732);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Market Analysis
    code: "uint32 itemId = 19245;\nfloat dominanceThreshold = 0.8f;\nif (marketAnalysis.IsMarketDominated(itemId,\
      \ dominanceThreshold)) {\n    sLog->outString(\"Item %u is heavily dominated\
      \ by a single faction.\", itemId);\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Item %u\
      \ shows balanced market distribution.\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached or real-time data from the auction house
    and vendor systems. Performance may be impacted if called frequently without caching
    results. The threshold parameter is interpreted as a ratio (e.g., 0.75 = 75%).
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId corresponds to an actual item in the database;
    otherwise behavior is undefined. Be cautious when using low thresholds, as they
    may return false positives for items with very few vendors.
