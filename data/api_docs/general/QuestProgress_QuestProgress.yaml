  method: QuestProgress
  signature: void QuestProgress::QuestProgress(uint32 qId, uint32 guid)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest progress for a player identified by their GUID for the
    specified quest ID.
  description: The QuestProgress method is used to update or set the progress of a
    specific quest for a player within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    handles the internal tracking of quest objectives, such as kills, items collected,
    or other required actions. It ensures that the player's quest data is synchronized
    with the game state and can trigger quest completion events when all objectives
    are met. The method operates on a per-player, per-quest basis and is commonly
    invoked by quest-related game mechanics or scripts to advance quest states.
  parameters:
  - name: qId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to update progress for. This value
      must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player whose quest progress is
      being updated. This typically represents the player's character GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Progress Update
    code: QuestProgress(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Quest Progress for Player in Script
    code: "void OnPlayerKill(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    QuestProgress(questId,\
      \ player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    a player interacts with quest-related objects or completes objectives. It does
    not directly send updates to the client; instead, it modifies internal data structures
    that are later synchronized during the next update cycle.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method may lead to inconsistent quest states or
    missing progress updates for players. Ensure that both qId and guid refer to valid
    entries in the database to prevent runtime errors.
