  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: RecommendEventTypes
  signature: int GuildEventCoordinator::RecommendEventTypes(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves recommended event types for a guild member.
  description: The RecommendEventTypes method determines and returns a list of event
    types that are suitable for recommendation to a guild member. This functionality
    is typically used within the context of guild event management systems where the
    game needs to suggest relevant events based on player activity, guild hierarchy,
    or other criteria. The method takes a pointer to a player object and processes
    it to determine appropriate event recommendations. It may consider factors such
    as player level, guild participation history, and event availability when generating
    these recommendations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which event type recommendations
      are being generated. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid
      player instance within the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of recommended event types
    found. A return value of zero indicates no recommendations were made, while positive
    values indicate the count of event types returned. Negative values may indicate
    errors or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nint numTypes = guildEventCoordinator->RecommendEventTypes(player);\n\
      if (numTypes > 0) {\n    // Process recommended event types\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Found \" << numTypes << \" recommended event types.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal logic to evaluate player eligibility
    for various guild events, including checking permissions, activity levels, and
    event prerequisites. It may cache results or use heuristics to optimize performance
    in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and points to an active
    player object; passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
