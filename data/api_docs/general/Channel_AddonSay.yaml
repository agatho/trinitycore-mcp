  method: AddonSay
  signature: void Channel::AddonSay(const int & guid, const std::string & prefix,
    const std::string & what, bool isLogged) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends an addon-specified message to all channel members with optional logging.
  description: The AddonSay method broadcasts a message to all players currently subscribed
    to the channel. It allows for custom prefix and content, and can optionally log
    the message to the server's chat logs. This method is typically used by addons
    or third-party tools to communicate with players in a specific channel without
    interfering with normal chat mechanics. The GUID parameter likely identifies the
    sender, while the prefix and what parameters define the message structure. The
    isLogged flag determines whether the message should be recorded in the server's
    logging system for administrative review.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the message sender, typically representing
      a player or addon instance.
  - name: prefix
    description: A string prefix to prepend to the message content, often used for
      categorization or identification by addons.
  - name: what
    description: The main message content that will be broadcasted to all channel
      members.
  - name: isLogged
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the message should be logged in the
      server's chat log for administrative purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Addon Message
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("Trade", player->GetTeam());

      channel->AddonSay(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), "[TradeBot]", "Hello traders!",
      false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logged Addon Announcement
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("Guild", player->GetGUID());

      channel->AddonSay(0, "[GuildAnnounce]", "Weekly raid is tomorrow at 7PM.", true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the assumption that the channel object is properly
    initialized and active. The GUID parameter may be set to zero if the sender is
    not a player entity. The prefix string should be kept short to avoid cluttering
    messages in the client UI.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to spamming or flooding of channels,
    which might result in performance issues or user complaints. Ensure that addon
    messages are relevant and not excessive. Using invalid GUIDs or malformed prefixes
    may cause unexpected behavior in channel handling.
