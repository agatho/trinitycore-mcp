documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotCreationTask class for managing bot
    creation operations.
  description: The BotCreationTask constructor initializes a new instance of the BotCreationTask
    class, setting up internal state and resources required for handling bot creation
    tasks within the TrinityCore framework. This class is typically used in conjunction
    with AI systems or automation tools to manage the lifecycle of game bots. The
    constructor ensures that all necessary data structures are properly initialized
    before any bot creation operations can be performed. It does not perform any actual
    bot creation; instead, it prepares the task object for subsequent method calls
    that will carry out the creation process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotCreationTask instance
    code: 'BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();

      // The task object is now ready to be used for bot creation operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing a new bot creation
    task. It does not validate input parameters as it takes no parameters. The class
    likely requires additional initialization through other methods before it can
    perform actual bot creation.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotCreationTask object is properly managed and destroyed
    to prevent memory leaks. This constructor does not perform any validation or error
    checking, so calling subsequent methods without proper setup may result in undefined
    behavior.
