  signature: float BotTalentManager::GetSpecPopularity(uint8 cls, uint8 specId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the popularity percentage of a specified talent specialization
    for a given class.
  description: The GetSpecPopularity method retrieves the relative usage frequency
    of a specific talent specialization within a given class across all bot characters
    in the system. This value is expressed as a float representing a percentage (0.0
    to 100.0), indicating how commonly that particular spec is chosen by bots. The
    method is typically used for balancing or statistical analysis purposes, helping
    determine which specializations are more or less prevalent among AI-controlled
    players. It requires valid class and specialization identifiers to return meaningful
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 100.0 representing the percentage popularity
    of the specified talent specialization within the given class. Returns 0.0 if
    the spec or class is invalid or not found in the bot population statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Get the popularity of Frost Mage specialization
    code: 'float frostMagePopularity = botTalentManager->GetSpecPopularity(CLASS_MAGE,
      SPEC_MAGE_FROST);

      std::cout << "Frost Mage popularity: " << frostMagePopularity << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal bot statistics tracking that accumulates
    data over time. It may not reflect real-time usage but rather a cached or periodically
    updated dataset. The method is probably thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded
    environment, though this depends on the underlying implementation of the BotTalentManager.
  warnings: Ensure that class and specId parameters are valid identifiers; invalid
    inputs may lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. This function should
    not be called during high-frequency operations due to potential performance impact
    from data aggregation.
