  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: InterruptCast
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::InterruptCast(int * player, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current cast of a player or target in PvP combat.
  description: The InterruptCast method attempts to interrupt the ongoing spell casting
    of either the player or their target within a PvP combat scenario. This method
    is typically used by AI systems to break enemy spell casts, particularly when
    the caster is vulnerable or when strategic interruption is required. The method
    evaluates whether an interruption is possible based on game mechanics such as
    cast time, spell type, and combat state. It returns true if the cast was successfully
    interrupted, false otherwise. The method assumes that both player and target are
    valid units in a PvP context and may perform checks to ensure they are engaged
    in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player unit whose cast is to be interrupted. Must
      point to a valid Player object in PvP combat.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit whose cast is to be interrupted. Must
      point to a valid Unit object that is currently casting a spell.
  returns: Returns true if the cast was successfully interrupted, false if the interruption
    failed or if no cast was in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (pvpAI->InterruptCast(&player, &target)) {\n    // Cast was interrupted\n\
      \    target->SendSpellGo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Combat State Check
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat() && target->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n\
      \    if (pvpAI->InterruptCast(&player, &target)) {\n        // Log interruption\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player interrupted target's spell.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and is intended for use in AI-driven
    combat systems. It relies on internal game state checks to determine if a cast
    can be interrupted. Performance-wise, it should be used sparingly during high-frequency
    combat events to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    note that not all spells can be interrupted; some may have immunity or special
    conditions that prevent interruption.
