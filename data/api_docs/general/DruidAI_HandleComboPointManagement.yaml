  class: DruidAI
  method: HandleComboPointManagement
  signature: void DruidAI::HandleComboPointManagement(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages combo point allocation and usage for Druid class AI.
  description: The HandleComboPointManagement method is responsible for controlling
    how combo points are handled within the Druid AI system. It determines when and
    how combo points are consumed, allocated, or reset based on the druid's current
    abilities and target state. This method integrates with the broader combat logic
    to ensure proper resource management during gameplay. The implementation likely
    evaluates the druid's current combo point count, available abilities, and target
    conditions to make decisions about combo point usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's combo point state
      or identifier. Used to determine which target to apply combo point management
      logic against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combo Point Management
    code: "void DruidAI::HandleComboPointManagement(int* target) {\n    if (*target\
      \ > 0) {\n        // Use combo points on target\n        *target -= 1;\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Druid AI's core combat decision-making system.
    It should be called during combat updates to ensure proper combo point usage.
    The target parameter may represent either a direct target reference or a state
    indicator for combo point tracking.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure the target value is properly initialized before calling this method.
