documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is within the recruit-a-friend distance range
    for triggering a recruitment event.
  description: This method checks if the player is positioned within the specific
    distance range required to initiate a recruit-a-friend (RAF) event. It evaluates
    whether the player's current location allows them to trigger a recruitment action,
    typically used in conjunction with other RAF-related mechanics. The method returns
    true when the player is at or within the specified distance, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for implementing recruitment mechanics and ensuring
    proper game progression in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the recruit-a-friend distance range,
    false otherwise. The method does not return a value that indicates specific distance
    values but rather evaluates whether the player meets the criteria for triggering
    a recruitment event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic RAF Distance Check
    code: "if (player->IsAtRecruitAFriendDistance(nullptr)) {\n    // Player is within\
      \ recruit-a-friend distance\n    // Proceed with recruitment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance calculations based on game mechanics
    and may involve checking against specific thresholds defined by the game client.
    Implementation details may vary depending on how the RAF system is configured
    in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: The method may not be reliable if used without proper context of the player's
    position or if the distance threshold changes based on game updates. Care should
    be taken when using this method for recruitment logic to ensure accurate results.
