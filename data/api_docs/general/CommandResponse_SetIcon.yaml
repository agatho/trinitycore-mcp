  class: CommandResponse
  method: SetIcon
  signature: CommandResponse & CommandResponse::SetIcon(uint32 icon)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the icon ID for the command response, typically used to display specific
    icons in client UI elements.
  description: The SetIcon method assigns an icon identifier to a CommandResponse
    object. This icon is usually rendered in the game client's user interface to visually
    represent the type or outcome of a command execution. The icon ID corresponds
    to predefined entries in the client's icon database, allowing for consistent visual
    feedback. This method supports method chaining by returning a reference to the
    modified object. It is commonly used in game master commands and admin tools where
    visual indicators are needed to enhance user experience.
  parameters:
  - name: icon
    description: The icon identifier to set for this command response. Valid values
      are typically defined in the client's icon database or related configuration
      files. Values should correspond to known UI icons used by TrinityCore's command
      system.
  returns: A reference to the CommandResponse object, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Icon for a Command Response
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.SetIcon(12345);

      // The command response will now display icon ID 12345 in the client UI'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining with SetIcon
    code: "CommandResponse response;\nresponse.SetIcon(54321)\n    .SetMessage(\"\
      Operation completed successfully\");\n// Both icon and message are set in a\
      \ fluent interface style"
    language: cpp
  notes: The icon ID must correspond to an existing entry in the client's icon database.
    Invalid or unknown icon IDs may result in no icon being displayed or default icons
    being used instead. This method is part of the CommandResponse class which is
    typically used within game master command implementations.
