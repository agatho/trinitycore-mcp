  method: RecordCombatMetric
  signature: void ScopedPatternRecording::RecordCombatMetric(float damage, float healing)
documentation:
  brief: Records combat metrics including damage and healing values for performance
    analysis.
  description: The RecordCombatMetric method is used to log and track combat-related
    statistics such as damage dealt and healing performed within a scoped recording
    context. This method is typically invoked during combat events to capture real-time
    data that can be used for performance monitoring, player behavior analysis, or
    in-game metric reporting. It does not return any value but updates internal tracking
    structures with the provided values. The method assumes valid float inputs representing
    damage and healing amounts, and it's designed to work within a larger combat analysis
    framework where multiple metrics may be recorded over time.
  parameters:
  - name: damage
    description: The amount of damage dealt during the combat event, represented as
      a floating-point value. Must be non-negative.
  - name: healing
    description: The amount of healing performed during the combat event, represented
      as a floating-point value. Must be non-negative.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat handler
    code: "void CombatHandler::OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target) {\n    float damage =\
      \ 150.0f;\n    float healing = 75.0f;\n    scopedRecorder->RecordCombatMetric(damage,\
      \ healing);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with dynamic values
    code: "void CombatManager::ProcessCombatEvent(float damageDealt, float healingDone)\
      \ {\n    if (damageDealt > 0.0f || healingDone > 0.0f) {\n        scopedRecorder->RecordCombatMetric(damageDealt,\
      \ healingDone);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be used within a scoped recording context and
    should not be called outside of an active combat session. The internal storage
    mechanism for these metrics may vary depending on the implementation of ScopedPatternRecording.
    Ensure that damage and healing values are properly validated before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with negative values for damage or healing may result
    in incorrect tracking. Do not call this method outside of a valid combat context
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption.
