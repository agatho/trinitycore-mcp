  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ExecuteSoloStrategy
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteSoloStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the solo questing strategy for a specified player bot.
  description: The ExecuteSoloStrategy method implements the core logic for handling
    quest progression when a player is operating alone, without group members. This
    function typically manages quest acceptance, objective tracking, and reward collection
    in a solo context. It may also handle specific quest behaviors or optimizations
    that differ from group questing mechanics. The method operates on a provided Player
    pointer representing the bot character, ensuring that all quest-related actions
    are performed within the context of that individual player's quest state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for which
      the solo questing strategy should be executed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ExecuteSoloStrategy
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object

      DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.ExecuteSoloStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest state management systems
    and may modify the player's quest log, objectives, and progress. It should only
    be called when the bot is in a solo state and not part of a group.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents an active
    bot character before calling this method. Calling with a null or invalid pointer
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
