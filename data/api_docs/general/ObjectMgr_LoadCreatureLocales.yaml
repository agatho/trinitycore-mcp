documentation:
  brief: Loads localized creature names and subnames from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadCreatureLocales method retrieves all localized creature name
    and subname entries from the database table 'locales_creature' and stores them
    in an internal lookup structure. This allows the game to display appropriate localized
    names for creatures based on the player's locale settings. The method is typically
    invoked during server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all
    creature localizations are available for use. It processes data from the database
    and populates a map structure that maps creature entry IDs to their respective
    localized strings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureLocales();\n    // Continue with other\
      \ initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. The loaded data is
    used by the GetCreatureLocaleName() and GetCreatureLocaleSubName() methods to
    provide localized creature information. It's thread-safe as it's designed to be
    called during server startup before concurrent access occurs.
  warnings: This method must not be called while creatures are actively being spawned
    or queried, as it modifies internal lookup tables that may be in use. Calling
    this method during runtime (outside of server initialization) could lead to race
    conditions or inconsistent data retrieval.
