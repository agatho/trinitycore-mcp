  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the legacy bot spawner adapter, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active bot spawning operations.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot spawning activities
    within the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter. It ensures that any running threads or processes
    related to bot creation are properly halted and cleaned up. This method is typically
    invoked when the server is shutting down or when the bot spawner functionality
    needs to be temporarily disabled. The shutdown process may involve notifying dependent
    systems, releasing allocated memory, and ensuring no dangling references remain.
    It is expected that this method is called only once during the lifetime of the
    adapter instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter* spawner = new LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter();

      // ... perform operations with the spawner ...

      spawner->Shutdown();

      delete spawner;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called concurrently with other methods of the adapter
    to avoid race conditions. It is recommended to ensure all pending bot requests
    are completed before invoking Shutdown.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on an already shut down instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify the state of the adapter before calling this
    method.
