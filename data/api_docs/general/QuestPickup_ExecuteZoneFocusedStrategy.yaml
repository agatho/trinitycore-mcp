  class: QuestPickup
  method: ExecuteZoneFocusedStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteZoneFocusedStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a zone-focused quest pickup strategy for the specified player bot.
  description: The ExecuteZoneFocusedStrategy method implements a quest pickup behavior
    that prioritizes quests within the player's current zone. It evaluates available
    quests in the vicinity and selects those that are most relevant based on zone
    context, quest level requirements, and player progress. This strategy ensures
    efficient quest progression by focusing on local objectives rather than global
    quest availability. The method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems to optimize
    quest completion within a specific geographic area.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the zone-focused quest pickup strategy. Must be a valid player instance with
      active questing capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.ExecuteZoneFocusedStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the bot has been properly initialized with quest data
    and zone information. The strategy may be affected by the bot's current location,
    quest availability in the zone, and player level restrictions.
