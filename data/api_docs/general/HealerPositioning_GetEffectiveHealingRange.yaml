  class: HealerPositioning
  method: GetEffectiveHealingRange
  signature: float HealerPositioning::GetEffectiveHealingRange(Player * healer)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effective healing range of a specified healer
    player.
  description: The GetEffectiveHealingRange method computes the actual healing range
    for a given healer player, taking into account various game mechanics such as
    spell range modifiers, buffs, debuffs, and class-specific abilities. This value
    represents the maximum distance at which the healer can effectively cast healing
    spells on target players. The method considers the healer's current state and
    any applicable effects that might alter their healing range. It is typically used
    in AI decision-making processes to determine whether a healer should move closer
    to a target or maintain distance during combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer whose effective
      healing range is to be calculated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the effective healing range in yards.
    This value accounts for all modifiers and effects that influence the healer's
    ability to heal from a distance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* healer = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nfloat range = HealerPositioning::GetEffectiveHealingRange(healer);\n\
      if (range > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range for positioning logic\n \
      \   printf(\"Effective healing range: %.2f yards\\n\", range);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Healing AI Logic
    code: "Player* healer = ...;\nfloat effectiveRange = HealerPositioning::GetEffectiveHealingRange(healer);\n\
      Player* target = ...;\nfloat distanceToTarget = healer->GetDistance(target);\n\
      \nif (distanceToTarget > effectiveRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n\
      \    healer->MoveTowards(target, effectiveRange * 0.8f);\n}\nelse if (distanceToTarget\
      \ < effectiveRange * 0.3f)\n{\n    // Move away from target to maintain optimal\
      \ range\n    healer->MoveAwayFrom(target, effectiveRange * 0.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates various TrinityCore subsystems including
    spell range calculations, aura effects, and player state management. The returned
    value may vary based on the healer's current buffs, debuffs, and class-specific
    abilities such as those from disciplines like Holy or Discipline priests.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null to avoid undefined behavior. The method might return zero or negative values
    in edge cases where healing range is completely negated by certain effects.
