  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: SetMaxBotsPerMap
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::SetMaxBotsPerMap(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots allowed per map in the bot population manager.
  description: The SetMaxBotsPerMap method configures the upper limit of bots that
    can exist within a single map instance. This setting affects how many artificial
    intelligence-controlled characters (bots) are permitted to spawn and operate in
    any given game world map. The method updates an internal configuration value that
    is used by the bot spawning system to enforce population limits. Changes made
    using this method take effect immediately for new spawns, but do not affect existing
    bots already present on the map. This functionality is crucial for managing server
    performance and ensuring balanced gameplay experiences when using bot systems.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed per map. Valid values are positive
      integers representing the upper bound of bot count per map instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bots Per Map to 50
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->SetMaxBotsPerMap(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Bot Population Based on Server Type
    code: "BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();\nif (IsTestingServer())\n\
      \    manager->SetMaxBotsPerMap(100);\nelse\n    manager->SetMaxBotsPerMap(25);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global configuration value that influences bot spawning
    behavior across all maps. The change is applied immediately to new map instances
    but does not retroactively adjust existing bots. It's recommended to call this
    method during server initialization or configuration loading phases rather than
    dynamically during gameplay.
  warnings: Setting this value too high may cause performance degradation due to excessive
    AI processing overhead. Setting it to zero effectively disables bot spawning on
    all maps. Changes to this setting while bots are active may result in inconsistent
    behavior until new spawns occur.
