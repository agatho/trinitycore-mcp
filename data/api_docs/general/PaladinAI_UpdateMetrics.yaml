documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics and timers for the Paladin AI behavior.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    various internal state variables and timing mechanisms within the PaladinAI class.
    This includes managing cooldowns, tracking spell usage, and updating AI decision-making
    parameters based on the elapsed time since the last update. The method typically
    gets called during the AI's update cycle to ensure that all relevant metrics are
    current and accurate for subsequent AI logic decisions. It plays a crucial role
    in ensuring proper spell timing and cooldown management for paladin-specific abilities.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateMetrics Call
    code: "void Update() {\n    // Called every AI update cycle\n    paladinAI->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main AI update loop and should
    be called with the appropriate time delta (diff) parameter to accurately track
    elapsed time. The implementation likely handles internal state transitions and
    cooldown resets based on the provided time interval.
