  class: BotTalentManager
  method: ReloadLoadouts
  signature: void BotTalentManager::ReloadLoadouts()
documentation:
  brief: Reloads all bot talent loadouts from the database or configuration files.
  description: The ReloadLoadouts method refreshes the internal cache of talent loadouts
    used by bot characters in the TrinityCore environment. This function ensures that
    any changes made to the loadout definitions, such as updated talent trees or modified
    spec configurations, are properly applied to all active bot instances. It typically
    triggers a full reload of the loadout data structure without requiring a server
    restart. The method is commonly invoked during runtime when administrators want
    to apply new talent configurations or debug issues related to bot behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotTalentManager::ReloadLoadouts();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in a live environment as it may temporarily
    disrupt bot behavior until the new loadouts are fully initialized. It is recommended
    to execute this during low-traffic periods or when bots are not actively engaged
    in combat.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively using talents might cause
    temporary inconsistencies or unexpected behavior. Ensure that no critical bot
    operations are in progress before invoking ReloadLoadouts.
