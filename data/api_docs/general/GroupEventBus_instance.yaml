documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GroupEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GroupEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the event bus exists throughout the
    application. This method is used to access the global event handling mechanism
    for group-related events in TrinityCore. The returned pointer provides access
    to all group event subscription and publishing functionality. This is a thread-safe
    implementation that guarantees consistent access to the singleton instance across
    different threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single GroupEventBus instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during system startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the GroupEventBus singleton
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = GroupEventBus::instance();

      // Use eventBus to subscribe or publish group events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the instance in event handling code
    code: "void HandleGroupJoin(Player* player, Group* group) {\n    GroupEventBus*\
      \ bus = GroupEventBus::instance();\n    // Publish group join event\n    bus->Publish(\"\
      group.join\", player, group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers singleton pattern with a local static variable
    for thread safety. The instance is created on first access and destroyed automatically
    at program termination. This implementation avoids the static initialization order
    fiasco that can occur with traditional singleton implementations.
