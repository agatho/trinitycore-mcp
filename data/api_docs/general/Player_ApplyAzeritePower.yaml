documentation:
  brief: Applies an Azerite power to the player's item.
  description: This method applies a specified Azerite power to the player's item,
    modifying the item's properties based on the power entry. It handles the activation
    or deactivation of Azerite powers within the context of World of Warcraft's Azerite
    system, which allows players to unlock and enhance their gear through Azerite
    traits. The method ensures proper synchronization between the item's state and
    the Azerite power being applied.

    description: Pointer to the item that will receive the Azerite power. This parameter
      represents the item being modified by the Azerite power.
  - name: azeritePower
    description: Pointer to the AzeritePowerEntry structure defining which Azerite
      power is being applied. This defines the specific power being activated or deactivated.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false) the
      Azerite power from the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      AzeritePowerEntry* azeritePower = new AzeritePowerEntry();

      player->ApplyAzeritePower(item, azeritePower, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during item processing or when updating Azerite
    gear. It requires careful handling of the item's state and should be called only
    when the player has access to valid Azerite power entries.
  warnings: Improper usage may lead to incorrect item states, which could cause game
    mechanics issues or invalid behavior in the Azerite system. Ensure that the item
    pointer is valid before calling this method.
