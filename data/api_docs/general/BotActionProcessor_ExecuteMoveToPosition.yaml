  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteMoveToPosition
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteMoveToPosition(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot movement action to a specified position within the game world.
  description: The ExecuteMoveToPosition method processes a bot movement command,
    instructing a player-controlled bot to navigate to a designated coordinate in
    the game world. This method is part of the BotActionProcessor class and handles
    the logic for moving bots using pathfinding and navigation systems. It typically
    expects a valid target position and may involve checking for obstacles, terrain
    restrictions, or other environmental factors that could impede movement. The method
    returns a BotActionResult indicating success or failure of the movement operation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the movement action.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction structure containing the details of the
      movement command, including target position and any associated parameters.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult indicating whether the movement was successfully
    initiated or if an error occurred. Possible values may include success flags,
    failure codes, or specific status indicators related to pathfinding or execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Execution
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BotActionType::MOVE_TO_POSITION;\naction.targetPosition\
      \ = {123.45f, 678.90f, 100.0f};\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteMoveToPosition(bot,\
      \ action);\nif (result.success) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation system of TrinityCore to
    calculate and execute paths. It may block or asynchronously process movement depending
    on implementation details. Ensure that the target position is within valid bounds
    and accessible by the bot's current zone.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the action data may result
    in undefined behavior or failed movements. The bot must be in a valid state for
    movement commands to be processed correctly.
