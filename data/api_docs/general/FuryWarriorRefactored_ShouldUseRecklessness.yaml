  method: ShouldUseRecklessness
  signature: bool FuryWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseRecklessness(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Fury Warrior should use the Recklessness ability based
    on current combat state and target conditions.
  description: This method evaluates the optimal timing for using the Recklessness
    ability in a Fury Warrior's rotation. It considers factors such as the player's
    current rage, available cooldowns, target threat level, and combat duration to
    determine if activating Recklessness would provide a net benefit. The method is
    typically used within the AI decision-making process to prioritize ability usage
    during combat encounters. It does not directly invoke the ability but rather returns
    a boolean value indicating whether it should be executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Fury Warrior should use Recklessness at the current
    moment, otherwise false. The decision is based on combat state, resource levels,
    and strategic timing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (player->GetFuryWarriorAI()->ShouldUseRecklessness(target)) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ RECKLESSNESS_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with rotation logic
    code: "void FuryWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldUseRecklessness(target))\
      \ {\n        // Execute Recklessness\n        DoCast(SPELL_RECKLESSNESS);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Fury Warrior's AI implementation and should be
    called within the context of combat decision-making. The method does not account
    for external factors like raid cooldowns or player buffs that might affect overall
    strategy.
  warnings: Ensure that Recklessness is not used in situations where it would cause
    the player to lose significant threat or break important mechanics such as boss
    enrage timers. This method assumes the target is valid and within combat range.
