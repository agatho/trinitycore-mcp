  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateEmergencyEscape
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateEmergencyEscape(uint32
    spellId, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a prioritized action for emergency escape mechanics in
    combat situations.
  description: The CreateEmergencyEscape method generates a PrioritizedAction object
    designed to handle urgent escape behaviors during combat. This typically involves
    initiating an immediate retreat or defensive maneuver when the player or NPC is
    under threat. The method likely evaluates current combat state, threat level,
    and available escape options to determine the most appropriate emergency action.
    It's intended for use in AI decision-making systems where rapid response to dangerous
    situations is critical.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell or ability to be used for emergency escape.
      This determines which escape mechanism will be prioritized.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the target for the escape action.
      May be null if no specific target is required for the escape maneuver.
  returns: A PrioritizedAction object containing the configuration and priority level
    for executing an emergency escape behavior, including spell information and target
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Escape Creation
    code: PrioritizedAction escapeAction = helper.CreateEmergencyEscape(12345, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency Escape with Target Selection
    code: 'int targetId = 67890;

      PrioritizedAction escapeAction = helper.CreateEmergencyEscape(12345, &targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that evaluates combat scenarios
    and selects appropriate actions. The spellId parameter should reference valid
    escape or defensive spells within the TrinityCore spell database. The target parameter
    may be used for actions like fleeing from a specific enemy or moving to a designated
    safe zone.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to an actual usable escape
    ability in the game world, otherwise the action may fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior. Be cautious when using non-null target pointers as they must point to
    valid entities.
