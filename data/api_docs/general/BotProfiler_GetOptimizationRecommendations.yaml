  class: BotProfiler
  method: GetOptimizationRecommendations
  signature: int BotProfiler::GetOptimizationRecommendations(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes bot performance data and returns optimization recommendations for
    a specified session.
  description: The GetOptimizationRecommendations method retrieves performance profiling
    data associated with the given sessionId and evaluates it to generate actionable
    optimization suggestions. This method is typically used by the TrinityCore AI
    system to provide insights into bot behavior, resource usage, and potential improvements.
    The returned integer value indicates the success or failure of the analysis process,
    with positive values representing successful recommendations and negative values
    indicating errors or no data available. The method requires that a valid profiling
    session exists for the provided sessionId.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the bot profiling session to analyze. This
      value is typically generated when a bot profiling session begins and must correspond
      to an active session in the system.
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the result of the optimization analysis:
    0 or positive values indicate successful recommendation generation, while negative
    values indicate errors such as invalid session ID, no data available, or internal
    processing failures.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nint result = botProfiler.GetOptimizationRecommendations(sessionId);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    // Process optimization recommendations\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Recommendations generated successfully. Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to generate recommendations.\
      \ Error code: \" << result << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on previously collected profiling data from the BotProfiler
    system. It may perform blocking operations while analyzing session data, so it
    should be called appropriately in non-critical execution paths to avoid performance
    impact. The sessionId parameter must refer to an existing and active profiling
    session.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or expired sessionId will likely return
    a negative error code. Ensure that the session exists and is still valid before
    calling this function. This method may block until profiling data is fully processed,
    so avoid calling it in time-sensitive contexts.
