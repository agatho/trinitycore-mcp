documentation:
  brief: Returns whether player movement is currently allowed in the world
  description: The getAllowMovement method checks the global movement restriction
    state for players within the World. This flag determines if players are permitted
    to move their characters, which can be toggled during various game events such
    as combat, teleportation sequences, or server maintenance. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating the current movement allowance status.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if player movement is currently allowed, false if movement is restricted
  examples:
  - title: Check Movement Allowance Before Player Action
    code: "if (World::getInstance()->getAllowMovement()) {\n    // Safe to process\
      \ player movement\n    player->MovePlayer();\n} else {\n    // Movement is currently\
      \ disabled\n    player->SendMoveFailed();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically reflects server-wide movement restrictions that may
    be set during critical game events. The implementation likely checks internal
    flags or state variables that control character movement across all zones and
    instances.
