documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuctionHouse class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuctionHouse
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of the auction house
    system. This method ensures that only one AuctionHouse object exists throughout
    the application lifecycle, maintaining consistent state for all auction-related
    operations. The returned pointer can be used to access all auction house functionality
    including item listings, bidding, and transaction processing. This is a thread-safe
    implementation that guarantees the same instance is returned across all calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton AuctionHouse instance. Returns a valid pointer
    to the auction house object, or nullptr if the instance could not be initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionHouse* ah = AuctionHouse::instance();\nif (ah)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ auction house instance\n    ah->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Auction Data
    code: "AuctionHouse* ah = AuctionHouse::instance();\nif (ah)\n{\n    // Get all\
      \ active auctions\n    std::vector<AuctionEntry*> auctions = ah->GetAuctions();\n\
      \    for (auto& auction : auctions)\n    {\n        // Process each auction\
      \ entry\n        sLog->outString(\"Auction ID: %u\", auction->Id);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern and should be used carefully to
    avoid tight coupling. The AuctionHouse instance is typically initialized during
    server startup and destroyed at shutdown. Multiple calls to this method will return
    the same pointer address, ensuring consistent access to auction data across all
    subsystems.
  warnings: Avoid storing references to the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of
    the AuctionHouse singleton, as this could lead to dangling pointers. Do not call
    this method from within a constructor or destructor of other singletons that might
    be initialized before or after the AuctionHouse instance.
