  method: UpdateEchoStates
  signature: void EchoController::UpdateEchoStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal echo states for all active echoes in the controller.
  description: The UpdateEchoStates method is responsible for synchronizing and refreshing
    the current state of all echo entities managed by the EchoController. This includes
    updating their positions, statuses, and any associated timers or effects. The
    method typically runs on a periodic basis within the game loop to ensure that
    echoes remain synchronized with the game world. It may also handle cleanup of
    expired echoes and trigger relevant events or callbacks when echo states change.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    m_echoController.UpdateEchoStates();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Trigger for Debugging
    code: "void DebugCommandHandler::HandleEchoUpdate()\n{\n    sEchoController->UpdateEchoStates();\n\
      \    ChatHandler->SendSysMessage(\"Echo states updated manually.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from the main game update loop or a dedicated
    thread. It's important to ensure that echo state updates do not cause performance
    bottlenecks, especially when managing many echoes simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can lead to unnecessary overhead. Avoid
    calling it outside of normal update cycles unless specifically required for debugging
    or testing purposes.
