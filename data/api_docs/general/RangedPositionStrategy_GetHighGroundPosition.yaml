  class: RangedPositionStrategy
  method: GetHighGroundPosition
  signature: int RangedPositionStrategy::GetHighGroundPosition(const int & current)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the highest ground position for ranged combat positioning
    based on the current position.
  description: 'The GetHighGroundPosition method determines an optimal elevated position
    for ranged units to engage targets from, considering terrain elevation and combat
    mechanics. This method is typically used in AI behavior strategies to improve
    positioning during ranged attacks. It evaluates the current position and returns
    a calculated high ground value that represents the most advantageous elevation
    for ranged combat effectiveness. The method considers factors such as line of
    sight, height differentials, and potential cover from the environment. Precondition:
    The method assumes valid terrain data is available and accessible through the
    underlying game world system.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated high ground position
    elevation level. A positive value indicates an elevated position above the current
    terrain, while a negative value may indicate a lower than optimal position or
    an error condition if the value is excessively negative.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Strategy
    code: "int highGround = strategy.GetHighGroundPosition(currentPosition);\nif (highGround\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Move to high ground for better ranged positioning\n    unit->SetPosition(unit->GetPositionX(),\
      \ unit->GetPositionY(), highGround);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RangedPositionStrategy class and is designed to
    work within TrinityCore's AI framework. The implementation likely uses terrain
    height maps and collision detection to determine optimal positioning. Performance
    may be impacted by complex terrain calculations in large open-world environments.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if terrain data is incomplete
    or corrupted. Always validate the returned value before using it for positioning
    decisions. In multi-threaded scenarios, ensure thread-safe access to terrain and
    position data.
