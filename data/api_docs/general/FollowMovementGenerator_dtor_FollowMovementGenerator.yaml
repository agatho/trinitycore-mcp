  method: ~FollowMovementGenerator
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::~FollowMovementGenerator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FollowMovementGenerator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the FollowMovementGenerator class is responsible
    for releasing any memory or resources allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This includes cleaning up internal references to target units, removing any active
    movement callbacks, and ensuring proper cleanup of AI state tracking. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this destructor ensures that when a creature
    or unit stops following another entity, all related movement data is properly
    deallocated to prevent memory leaks. The method is automatically invoked when
    the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of FollowMovementGenerator
    code: 'FollowMovementGenerator* generator = new FollowMovementGenerator(targetUnit,
      distance, angle);

      // ... use the generator ...

      delete generator; // Triggers ~FollowMovementGenerator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when a FollowMovementGenerator object
    is deleted. It's important to ensure that no references to the generator exist
    after deletion to avoid dangling pointers. The cleanup process may involve notifying
    the movement manager or AI system about the termination of the follow behavior.
  warnings: Do not manually call this destructor; it should only be invoked through
    proper object deletion mechanisms. Improper handling of object lifetime can lead
    to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
