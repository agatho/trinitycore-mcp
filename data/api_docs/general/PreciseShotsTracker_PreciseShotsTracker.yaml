  class: PreciseShotsTracker
  method: PreciseShotsTracker
  signature: void PreciseShotsTracker::PreciseShotsTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PreciseShotsTracker class for managing
    precise shot tracking mechanics.
  description: The PreciseShotsTracker constructor initializes internal data structures
    and state variables required for tracking precise shots in the game. This class
    is typically used within the context of player ability systems, particularly for
    archery or ranged combat mechanics where precision and timing of shots are important.
    The initialization process sets up necessary counters, flags, and tracking mechanisms
    that allow the system to monitor shot accuracy, cooldowns, and other related statistics.
    It ensures that all internal state is properly configured before the tracker begins
    monitoring player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of PreciseShotsTracker
    code: 'PreciseShotsTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track precise shots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic tracking state. The actual tracking functionality
    will be invoked through other methods like Update(), TrackShot(), or similar event
    handlers.
