  class: PathGenerator
  method: GetActualEndPosition
  signature: const int & PathGenerator::GetActualEndPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the actual end position of the generated path.
  description: The GetActualEndPosition method retrieves the final coordinate or node
    in a calculated path. This is particularly useful for determining where a character
    or unit will ultimately arrive after following a computed route. The returned
    value represents the endpoint of the path that was generated by the PathGenerator,
    which may differ from the originally requested destination due to obstacles, terrain,
    or other navigation constraints. This method ensures accurate positioning data
    for movement-related systems in the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the actual end position
    of the path. The value typically corresponds to a node index or coordinate in
    the pathfinding grid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume path has been generated previously

      const int& endPos = pathGen.GetActualEndPosition();

      std::cout << "Path ends at position: " << endPos << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a valid path has been generated using
    the PathGenerator. Calling it before path generation may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect values.
