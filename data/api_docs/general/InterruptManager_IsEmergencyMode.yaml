  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsEmergencyMode
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsEmergencyMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the interrupt manager is currently in emergency mode.
  description: The IsEmergencyMode method determines whether the interrupt manager
    is operating in emergency mode. This mode typically indicates that the system
    has detected an urgent condition requiring immediate attention or special handling,
    such as a critical failure, high-priority event, or resource constraint. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this emergency flag. In
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this could be relevant during combat
    situations, server load management, or when processing time-sensitive events where
    normal interrupt handling might be bypassed or altered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt manager is currently in emergency mode; otherwise
    returns false. The emergency mode flag may be set by internal system logic or
    external triggers based on game state conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (interruptManager.IsEmergencyMode()) {\n    // Handle emergency interrupt\
      \ logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Emergency mode active, processing interrupts\
      \ with priority.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a read-only accessor that checks an internal boolean
    flag. It should be lightweight and safe for frequent calls. The emergency mode
    state may be modified by other system components or triggered by specific game
    events such as server overload conditions, critical combat scenarios, or resource
    exhaustion.
