  method: HandleUnused
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleUnused(const AuraApplication * param0, uint8 param1,
    bool param2) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles unused aura effect application events for a given aura application.
  description: The HandleUnused method is a placeholder or stub implementation within
    the AuraEffect class that processes unused aura effect applications. This method
    is typically called during aura application lifecycle events when an aura effect
    is not actively being used or applied to a target. It serves as a hook point for
    potential future functionality or cleanup operations related to aura effects that
    are no longer in use. The method takes an aura application pointer, a byte parameter
    representing the effect index, and a boolean flag indicating whether the effect
    should be removed from the target.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. This parameter provides access to the aura's state, target, and other
      related information.
  - name: param1
    description: Byte value indicating the effect index within the aura. This represents
      which specific effect of the aura is being processed, typically ranging from
      0 to the number of effects in the aura minus one.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura effect should be removed
      from the target. When true, the effect may be cleaned up or unapplied from the
      target; when false, it might remain in a dormant state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of HandleUnused
    code: "void ExampleAuraEffect::HandleUnused(const AuraApplication* auraApp, uint8\
      \ effIndex, bool remove)\n{\n    // This is a stub implementation\n    if (remove)\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform cleanup operations\n        // e.g., remove any temporary\
      \ modifiers or effects\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Do nothing or prepare\
      \ for potential future use\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a placeholder implementation that may be overridden
    by derived classes to provide specific behavior. It's part of the aura effect
    system in TrinityCore and is invoked during various aura lifecycle events such
    as application, removal, or update. Developers should note that this method does
    not perform any actual processing in its current form.
  warnings: Since this is a stub implementation, calling this method directly without
    proper context may lead to unexpected behavior. It's important to ensure that
    derived classes properly implement this method if custom aura effect handling
    is required.
