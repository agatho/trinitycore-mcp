documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild integration state based on the elapsed time delta
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of guild integrations within the TrinityCore framework. It handles periodic
    tasks such as synchronization with external systems, updating guild member data,
    managing guild events, and performing any time-based operations required for guild
    functionality. This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular
    intervals to ensure that guild-related systems remain synchronized and responsive.
    The implementation likely processes queued guild operations, checks for timeouts
    or expiration conditions, and updates internal state variables accordingly.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetMillisecondsSinceLastUpdate();\n\
      \    guildIntegration->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game loop with accurate time
    deltas to ensure proper synchronization. The implementation may involve database
    operations and network communication, so performance considerations are important
    for high-traffic servers.
