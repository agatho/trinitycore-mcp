documentation:
  brief: Sets the velocity for a spline movement animation
  description: The SetVelocity method configures the speed at which a character or
    object will move along a spline path. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with MoveSplineInit to define movement parameters before initiating spline-based
    locomotion. The velocity value determines how fast the movement occurs, affecting
    both the duration and smoothness of the animation. This method directly influences
    the movement behavior in TrinityCore's pathfinding and animation system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Movement Velocity for Player
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetVelocity(4.5f); // Set movement speed to 4.5 yards per second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Velocity Adjustment During Movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      float currentSpeed = player->GetSpeed(MOVE_RUN);

      splineInit.SetVelocity(currentSpeed); // Match player''s current running speed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating the actual spline movement.
    The velocity value is typically expressed in yards per second and affects the
    overall duration of the movement animation. This method works within TrinityCore's
    spline-based movement system which handles complex pathfinding and smooth character
    animations.
  warnings: Setting velocity values that are too high may cause visual artifacts or
    desynchronization with server-side movement updates. Ensure that velocity values
    align with game mechanics and player expectations for realistic movement behavior.
