  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: ReceiveIncludedDirectories
  signature: DirectoryStorage UpdateFetcher::ReceiveIncludedDirectories() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the collection of included directories used by the update fetcher
    for resource management.
  description: The ReceiveIncludedDirectories method returns a DirectoryStorage object
    containing all the directories that are explicitly included for processing within
    the update fetcher. This functionality is typically utilized in the context of
    World of Warcraft's data update mechanisms, where specific directory structures
    need to be scanned or processed during patch application or content loading. The
    returned DirectoryStorage encapsulates the hierarchical structure and paths of
    these included directories, enabling efficient traversal and resource access.
    This method does not modify any internal state and serves purely as a read-only
    accessor for the configured include directories.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DirectoryStorage object representing the collection of included directories.
    This object contains all directory paths that have been registered for inclusion
    in the update fetcher's processing scope, allowing for organized access to resources
    within those directories.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "UpdateFetcher fetcher;\nDirectoryStorage includedDirs = fetcher.ReceiveIncludedDirectories();\n\
      for (const auto& dir : includedDirs.GetDirectories()) {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Included directory: \" << dir << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads without
    synchronization concerns. The returned DirectoryStorage object should not be modified
    directly as it may affect the internal state of the UpdateFetcher instance.
