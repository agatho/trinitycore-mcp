    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given position in a map is considered a void position, typically
    indicating an invalid or unreachable area.
  description: The IsVoidPosition method evaluates whether a specified position within
    a given map is classified as a 'void' position. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, a void position usually refers to areas that are not traversable
    by players or creatures, such as empty spaces outside of valid world boundaries
    or regions marked as inaccessible. This method is commonly used during movement
    validation to prevent units from moving into invalid locations. The method takes
    a pointer to a Map object and an integer representing the position (likely a coordinate
    or index) and returns true if the position is deemed void, false otherwise. It's
    important to note that this check may involve internal map data structures and
    collision detection logic.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the position is located. This represents
      the game world map instance containing terrain and navigational data.
  - name: position
    description: Integer value representing the position to be checked. This could
      represent a coordinate value, index in a grid, or other positional identifier
      within the map's coordinate system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is classified as a void position
    (i.e., not traversable), false otherwise. A void position typically indicates
    an invalid or inaccessible area of the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Validation
    code: "if (validator.IsVoidPosition(map, playerPosition)) {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ movement\n    SendMovementError(player, \"Cannot move to this location\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with valid movement\n    ProcessPlayerMovement(player,\
      \ newPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Positions for Void Status
    code: "std::vector<int> positions = {100, 250, 500, 750};\nfor (int pos : positions)\
      \ {\n    if (validator.IsVoidPosition(map, pos)) {\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\"\
      , \"Position {} is void and cannot be traversed.\", pos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against map navigation data structures.
    It may involve collision detection or boundary validation logic. The exact implementation
    details depend on how positions are interpreted within the Map class and its underlying
    navigational system.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Map pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, verify that the position value is within expected ranges for the map's coordinate
    system to avoid unexpected results.
