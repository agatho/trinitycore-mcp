documentation:
  brief: Returns the ping restriction setting for the group
  description: The GetRestrictPings method retrieves the current ping restriction
    configuration for the group. This setting determines whether pings (such as those
    used for targeting or communication) are restricted to specific members of the
    group. The returned RestrictPingsTo enum value indicates the scope of who can
    send pings within the group. This functionality is commonly used in raid environments
    to control communication and prevent spam or unauthorized targeting.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a RestrictPingsTo enum value indicating the current ping restriction
    policy for the group. Possible values include: RESTRICT_PINGS_NONE (no restrictions),
    RESTRICT_PINGS_LEADER (only leader can ping), RESTRICT_PINGS_OFFICER (officers
    and leaders can ping), and RESTRICT_PINGS_ALL (any group member can ping).'
  examples:
  - title: Check current ping restrictions in a group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    RestrictPingsTo\
      \ pingRestriction = group->GetRestrictPings();\n    switch (pingRestriction)\n\
      \    {\n        case RESTRICT_PINGS_NONE:\n            // All members can ping\n\
      \            break;\n        case RESTRICT_PINGS_LEADER:\n            // Only\
      \ leader can ping\n            break;\n        case RESTRICT_PINGS_OFFICER:\n\
      \            // Officers and leaders can ping\n            break;\n        case\
      \ RESTRICT_PINGS_ALL:\n            // Any group member can ping\n          \
      \  break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group management features
    to control communication within raid instances. The restriction settings are usually
    set by the group leader or raid officer and affect all members of the group.
