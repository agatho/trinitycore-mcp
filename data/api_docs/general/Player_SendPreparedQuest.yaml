  brief: Send a prepared quest to the player's quest log
  description: This method sends a prepared quest to the player's quest log, allowing
    the player to receive and track quests that have been prepared for them. The method
    is typically used in conjunction with quest preparation systems within the TrinityCore
    framework, enabling players to receive quests that are ready to be accepted or
    completed. It ensures that the quest data is properly initialized and sent to
    the player's client so they can view and interact with it.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the source of the quest, typically
      indicating where the quest originates from (e.g., NPC, object, or event). This
      value determines how the quest is handled by the game system.
  returns: null

  notes: The method requires that the quest data be properly initialized before calling
    this function. It is part of a larger system where quests are prepared and sent
    to players based on their current state or location in the game world.
