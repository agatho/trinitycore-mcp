  signature: void ObjectCache::~ObjectCache()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ObjectCache instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ObjectCache destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the ObjectCache object. This includes releasing any
    cached objects, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks
    occur. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this destructor ensures proper cleanup of cached game objects such as players,
    creatures, items, and other entities that may have been stored in memory for performance
    optimization purposes. The destructor is automatically invoked when an ObjectCache
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = new ObjectCache();

      // ... use the cache ...

      delete cache; // This calls ~ObjectCache()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup with Stack Allocation
    code: "void Function()\n{\n    ObjectCache cache;\n    // ... use cache ...\n\
      \    // ~ObjectCache() automatically called when function ends\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implemented as a virtual function, allowing proper polymorphic
    behavior if ObjectCache is inherited. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called manually unless the object was allocated with 'new'. The
    cleanup process may involve iterating through cached objects and calling their
    destructors or releasing reference counts.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it will
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure all references to cached objects are properly
    managed before destruction to avoid dangling pointers or use-after-free errors.
