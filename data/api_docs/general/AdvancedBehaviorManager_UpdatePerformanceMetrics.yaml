documentation:
  brief: Updates internal performance metrics for advanced AI behavior management
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method collects and processes timing data
    from various AI behavior operations within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This method
    is typically invoked during periodic updates to track execution times, resource
    usage, and overall system performance of AI-driven character behaviors. It helps
    identify bottlenecks in AI processing and ensures optimal performance for complex
    NPC decision-making systems. The method may also trigger logging or reporting
    mechanisms when performance thresholds are exceeded.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_advancedBehaviorManager->UpdatePerformanceMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    accurate performance tracking. It may involve CPU timing measurements and could
    have minimal performance impact during normal operation. The collected metrics
    are typically used for debugging, optimization, and monitoring of AI behavior
    performance in live game environments.
