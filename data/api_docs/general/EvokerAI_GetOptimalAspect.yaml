  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetOptimalAspect
  signature: EvokerAspect EvokerAI::GetOptimalAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most optimal evoker aspect for the current combat
    situation.
  description: The GetOptimalAspect method evaluates the current state of the evoker's
    target, including health percentage, debuff status, and available abilities, to
    determine which evoker aspect (such as Aspect of the Wild, Aspect of the Pack,
    etc.) would provide the greatest benefit in terms of damage output or survivability.
    This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes to select
    the best aspect for the current encounter. The method considers factors like target
    proximity, threat level, and the evoker's current resource state to make its determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an EvokerAspect enum value representing the optimal aspect to use.
    Possible values include ASPECT_NONE, ASPECT_WILD, ASPECT_PACK, etc., depending
    on the implementation logic and current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "EvokerAspect optimalAspect = evokerAI->GetOptimalAspect();\nif (optimalAspect\
      \ != ASPECT_NONE)\n{\n    // Apply the optimal aspect\n    evoker->SetCurrentAspect(optimalAspect);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during combat to dynamically adjust
    the evoker's aspect selection. It may cache results or use a simple heuristic
    for performance reasons, especially in high-frequency AI update scenarios.
