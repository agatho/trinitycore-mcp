documentation:
  brief: Resets the attack timer for the unit, allowing it to attack again immediately.
  description: The resetAttackTimer method resets the attack timer of a Unit, enabling
    it to perform another attack immediately. This method is commonly used in combat
    scenarios where an unit needs to re-evaluate its attack timing after certain events
    or conditions have occurred. It's particularly useful for controlling the frequency
    of attacks in both player and NPC combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of attack timer to reset. Valid values are 0 (melee), 1
      ( ranged), or 2 (spell). This parameter determines which specific attack timer
      is reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = getTarget();\n\nif (target)\n{\n    target->resetAttackTimer(0);\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to manage the timing of attacks. It may be called during various combat states
    or when specific conditions are met, such as when a unit's attack timer expires
    or when certain abilities are used.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in combat,
    particularly if used without proper context. Be cautious when calling this method
    on NPCs or players who may have specific attack timing requirements.
