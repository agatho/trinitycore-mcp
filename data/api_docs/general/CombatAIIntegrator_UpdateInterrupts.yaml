  method: UpdateInterrupts
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateInterrupts(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates and processes interruptible actions within combat AI.
  description: The UpdateInterrupts method handles the logic for managing interruptible
    abilities and actions during combat. It processes queued interrupts, evaluates
    conditions for interruption, and updates the state of combat-related interruptible
    events. This method is typically called from the main AI update loop to ensure
    timely handling of interrupt triggers such as spell interruptions, movement interrupts,
    or other combat state changes that require immediate attention. The method operates
    on a time-based diff parameter to maintain consistent timing across different
    frame rates.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last update call, used to determine
      when interrupt conditions should be evaluated and processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::Update()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTimeDiff(m_lastUpdate,\
      \ getMSTime());\n    UpdateInterrupts(diff);\n    m_lastUpdate = getMSTime();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetTimeDiff(m_lastCombatUpdate);\n\
      \    UpdateInterrupts(diff);\n    // Additional combat logic here\n    m_lastCombatUpdate\
      \ = getMSTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat AI updates to ensure
    proper interrupt handling. The diff parameter is crucial for maintaining consistent
    timing regardless of frame rate variations. Implementation may involve checking
    for spell interruption conditions, movement state changes, and other combat events
    that require immediate processing.
  warnings: Failure to call UpdateInterrupts regularly can result in delayed or missed
    interrupt handling, potentially causing gameplay inconsistencies. The method assumes
    valid time diff values; extremely large or negative values may cause unexpected
    behavior.
