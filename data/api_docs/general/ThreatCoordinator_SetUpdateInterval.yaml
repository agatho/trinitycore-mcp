  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for threat calculations in milliseconds.
  description: Configures the frequency at which the ThreatCoordinator updates threat
    values for creatures and players. This interval determines how often the system
    recalculates and propagates threat information, affecting combat behavior and
    aggro management. The value is specified in milliseconds and controls the granularity
    of threat updates during combat encounters. Setting this value too low may increase
    CPU usage, while setting it too high can result in delayed threat reactions.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are typically between
      100 and 2000ms, though the exact range depends on system requirements and combat
      responsiveness needs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set standard threat update interval
    code: ThreatCoordinator::SetUpdateInterval(500);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure high-frequency threat updates for fast-paced combat
    code: ThreatCoordinator::SetUpdateInterval(100);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects global threat calculation timing across all creatures
    and players in the instance. The interval is applied immediately to subsequent
    threat updates, but existing threat values are not recalculated retroactively.
  warnings: Setting very low intervals (under 50ms) may cause performance degradation
    due to excessive CPU usage from frequent threat calculations. Avoid setting intervals
    above 3000ms as it may lead to noticeable lag in threat-based combat reactions.
