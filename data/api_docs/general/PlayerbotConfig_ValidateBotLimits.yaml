  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: ValidateBotLimits
  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::ValidateBotLimits()
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the current player bot configuration adheres to defined
    limits and constraints.
  description: The ValidateBotLimits method checks if the current player bot settings
    comply with the configured maximum limits for bots, such as maximum number of
    bots allowed per account or character. This method ensures that the bot system
    remains within acceptable bounds to prevent abuse or performance degradation.
    It typically evaluates configuration values against internal thresholds and returns
    true if all limits are satisfied, false otherwise. The validation may occur during
    initialization, configuration changes, or when attempting to create new bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all bot limits are within acceptable constraints; returns
    false if any limit is exceeded or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (playerbotConfig.ValidateBotLimits()) {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Bot limits validated successfully\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle limit violation\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Bot limits\
      \ exceeded, operation denied\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the player bot system during
    configuration updates or before creating new bots. It may also be invoked manually
    in custom scripts or modules to ensure compliance with server policies.
