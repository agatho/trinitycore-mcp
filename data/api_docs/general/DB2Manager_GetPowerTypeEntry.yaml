  signature: const PowerTypeEntry * DB2Manager::GetPowerTypeEntry(int power) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the PowerTypeEntry for a specified power type identifier.
  description: The GetPowerTypeEntry method fetches a PowerTypeEntry object from the
    DB2 database based on the provided power type index. This entry contains metadata
    about a specific power type, such as mana, rage, energy, or focus, which are used
    in World of Warcraft's resource management system. The method is typically used
    to access properties like power cost calculations, regeneration rates, and visual
    representations associated with different power types. It serves as a lookup mechanism
    for core game mechanics involving player resources and abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the PowerTypeEntry structure corresponding to the specified
    power type index. Returns nullptr if no entry exists for the given power type
    identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Power Type Entry for Mana
    code: "const PowerTypeEntry* manaEntry = sDB2Manager->GetPowerTypeEntry(0);\n\
      if (manaEntry)\n{\n    printf(\"Mana power type name: %s\\n\", manaEntry->Name);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal DB2 cache, making it efficient
    for repeated calls. The power type index corresponds to the PowerType enum values
    defined in the game's data files.
