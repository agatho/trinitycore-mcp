  method: AddCacheEntry
  signature: void PathfindingManager::AddCacheEntry(const PathCacheEntry & entry)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new pathfinding cache entry to the manager's internal cache storage.
  description: The AddCacheEntry method is responsible for inserting a new PathCacheEntry
    object into the PathfindingManager's internal caching system. This allows the
    system to store precomputed paths or path-related data for efficient retrieval
    during subsequent navigation requests. The method typically handles the insertion
    logic, including potential cache eviction policies if the cache reaches capacity.
    It is commonly used by the pathfinding subsystem to persist computed routes and
    avoid recomputing the same paths repeatedly. This method does not return any value
    as it operates purely as a side effect of modifying the internal cache state.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A const reference to a PathCacheEntry object containing the pathfinding
      data to be cached. This entry typically includes path coordinates, cost information,
      and metadata about the cached path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of AddCacheEntry
    code: 'PathCacheEntry cacheEntry;

      cacheEntry.path = { {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f} };

      cacheEntry.cost = 10.0f;

      pathfindingManager.AddCacheEntry(cacheEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the pathfinding system when
    a new path is computed and should be cached for future use. The implementation
    may include thread safety mechanisms depending on how it's used within the broader
    TrinityCore architecture.
