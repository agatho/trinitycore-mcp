  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: RemoveMemberFromGroup
  signature: bool PlayerbotGroupManager::RemoveMemberFromGroup(uint32 groupId, uint32
    memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player member from a specified group by their GUID.
  description: The RemoveMemberFromGroup method removes a player member from a specified
    group within the Playerbot system. It takes a group ID and a member's global unique
    identifier (GUID) as parameters. The method attempts to locate and remove the
    specified player from the group, updating internal group structures accordingly.
    This functionality is essential for managing dynamic group compositions in player
    bot scenarios where members may join or leave groups based on game conditions
    or player actions. The method returns true if the removal was successful, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group from which the member will be
      removed. Must correspond to an existing group in the system.
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player member to be removed
      from the group. Must represent a valid player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified member was successfully removed from the
    group, false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, non-existent group,
    or non-existent member.
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from Group
    code: "bool success = botGroupManager->RemoveMemberFromGroup(12345, 67890);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Member successfully removed\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Player with GUID 67890 removed from group 12345\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to remove member\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Failed to remove player with\
      \ GUID 67890 from group 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and member exist in the system. It does
    not perform any validation on whether the group is currently active or if the
    player is actually in the group. The implementation may also trigger internal
    updates to group state, such as reassigning leadership if needed.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid groupId or memberGuid values can result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that both parameters are valid before
    calling this function. Also, removing a player from a group may affect bot AI
    behavior and should be done carefully during active gameplay scenarios.
