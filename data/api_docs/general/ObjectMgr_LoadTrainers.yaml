documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all trainer data from the database into memory for
    use in the game world.
  description: The LoadTrainers method is responsible for loading all trainer-related
    information from the database tables into memory. This includes fetching data
    about trainers, their available spells, training costs, and required skills. The
    method typically runs during server startup or when the game world is initialized
    to ensure that all NPC trainers have their correct training data loaded. It processes
    entries from tables such as `npc_trainer`, `npc_trainer_template`, and related
    spell tables to populate internal data structures used by the game engine for
    handling trainer interactions. This method directly affects how players interact
    with NPCs who provide skill and spell training.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadTrainers();\n    // Other\
      \ loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server startup and should not
    be invoked repeatedly. It performs database queries to load trainer data, so performance
    can be affected by the number of trainers and their associated spells in the database.
