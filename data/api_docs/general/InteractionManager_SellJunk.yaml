api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: SellJunk
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::SellJunk(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Sells all junk items in the player's inventory to the specified vendor.
  description: The SellJunk method iterates through a player's inventory and sells
    all items that are classified as 'junk' (items with no value or utility) to the
    provided vendor. This is typically used by bot systems or automated scripts to
    manage inventory and generate gold. The method checks each item in the inventory,
    determines if it qualifies as junk based on game logic (such as item quality,
    level, or usability), and then attempts to sell it to the vendor. It returns an
    InteractionResult indicating success or failure of the operation. This method
    requires that the player is within interaction range of the vendor and that the
    vendor accepts junk items for purchase.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory will be processed for
      selling junk items.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor who will purchase
      the junk items.
  returns: An InteractionResult enum indicating the outcome of the sell operation.
    Possible values include SUCCESS if all junk items were sold, FAILURE if no items
    were sold or an error occurred, and potentially other states like INCOMPLETE if
    only some items were sold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ InteractionManager::SellJunk(bot, vendor);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\n\
      {\n    // Junk items successfully sold\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ InteractionManager::SellJunk(bot, vendor);\nswitch (result)\n{\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n\
      \        // Process successful sale\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILURE:\n\
      \        // Handle failed sale\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle\
      \ other cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor is valid and within interaction range.
    It may not handle all edge cases of item categorization or vendor-specific restrictions.
    The implementation likely uses internal item filtering logic to identify junk
    items, which might vary based on game version or custom configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and vendor pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes. This method does not verify if the player has sufficient
    inventory space after selling items, which may be important for certain automation
    scripts.
