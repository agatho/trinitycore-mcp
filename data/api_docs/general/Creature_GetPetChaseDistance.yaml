  class: Creature
  method: GetPetChaseDistance
  signature: float Creature::GetPetChaseDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the chase distance for a creature's pet.
  description: This method retrieves the current chase distance setting for a creature's
    pet, which determines how far the pet can follow its master before being forced
    to stop chasing. The value represents the distance in yards that the pet will
    maintain from its owner during combat. This is particularly relevant for pets
    that are not in combat, as they may be set to follow their master at different
    distances based on their AI behavior and configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the chase distance in yards. A value
    of 0 indicates that the pet will not chase at all, while higher values indicate
    longer chase distances. The exact value depends on the creature's specific configuration
    and AI settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float distance = creature->GetPetChaseDistance();\nif (distance > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Pet will chase up to this distance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pet AI behavior settings
    and may be affected by creature's AI flags. The value returned can vary depending
    on the creature's type, level, and specific configuration.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or when the pet is actively
    following its master, as it may return inaccurate values due to dynamic adjustments
    in the pet's behavior.
