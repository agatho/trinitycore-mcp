  method: HandleLootRollTimeout
  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleLootRollTimeout(uint32 rollId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the timeout of a loot roll, determining the final outcome when
    no player votes within the allotted time.
  description: The HandleLootRollTimeout method is responsible for managing the automatic
    resolution of a loot roll when the voting period expires without any player submitting
    a vote. This typically occurs in World of Warcraft's loot distribution system
    where players have a limited time to roll on items. The method ensures that if
    no valid rolls are submitted within the timeout period, the loot is either passed
    to the next eligible player or distributed according to the configured loot rules.
    It handles cleanup and updates internal state related to the specific roll ID
    provided.
  parameters:
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier for the loot roll that has timed out. This value
      corresponds to a specific roll entry in the loot distribution system, allowing
      the method to locate and process the correct roll data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Processing Timeout of a Loot Roll
    code: "LootDistribution* lootDist = sObjectMgr->GetLootDistribution(12345);\n\
      if (lootDist)\n{\n    lootDist->HandleLootRollTimeout(67890);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's internal timer system when
    a loot roll's voting period expires. It assumes that all necessary validation
    has been performed before calling, such as ensuring the roll ID exists and is
    still active. The method may trigger additional events or updates to inform players
    about the outcome of the timed-out roll.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent rollId can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the roll ID corresponds to a valid,
    active loot roll before invoking this method.
