documentation:
  brief: Calculates and records system performance metrics for bot behavior analysis
  description: The CalculateSystemMetrics method gathers various system resource usage
    statistics including CPU load, memory consumption, and thread utilization to evaluate
    the performance impact of bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. This
    method is typically invoked periodically to monitor system health and optimize
    bot behavior based on available resources. The collected metrics are used for
    performance tuning, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring stable gameplay when
    multiple bots are active.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.CalculateSystemMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently, as
    it accesses system-level information. It's recommended to call this method at
    appropriate intervals rather than continuously. The implementation relies on platform-specific
    APIs for retrieving system metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper throttling
    can cause unnecessary CPU overhead. Ensure that the calling code accounts for
    potential blocking behavior when accessing system resources.
