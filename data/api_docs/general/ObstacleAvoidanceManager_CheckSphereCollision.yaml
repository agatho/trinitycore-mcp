    float radius1, const int & center2, float radius2)
documentation:
  brief: Checks for collision between two spherical obstacles in the game world.
  description: The CheckSphereCollision method determines whether two spherical obstacles,
    defined by their center points and radii, intersect or overlap in the game world.
    This method is typically used in pathfinding and obstacle avoidance systems to
    prevent units from moving through solid objects. It performs a mathematical calculation
    to compare the distance between the centers of the two spheres against the sum
    of their radii. If the distance is less than or equal to the combined radius,
    a collision is detected and the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
    The method assumes that the center points are valid coordinates in the game world
    space.
  parameters:
  - name: center1
    description: Reference identifier for the first sphere's center point. This typically
      represents a unique identifier or index used to locate the position of the first
      obstacle in the system.
  - name: radius1
    description: Radius of the first spherical obstacle. Must be a non-negative floating-point
      value representing the size of the obstacle in world units.
  - name: center2
    description: Reference identifier for the second sphere's center point. This typically
      represents a unique identifier or index used to locate the position of the second
      obstacle in the system.
  - name: radius2
    description: Radius of the second spherical obstacle. Must be a non-negative floating-point
      value representing the size of the obstacle in world units.
  returns: Returns true if the two spheres collide or overlap, false otherwise. A
    collision occurs when the distance between the centers is less than or equal to
    the sum of the radii.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Check
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;\nbool collision = manager->CheckSphereCollision(1001,\
      \ 5.0f, 1002, 3.0f);\nif (collision) {\n    // Handle collision\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Unit Movement
    code: "Unit* unit = ...;\nfloat unitRadius = unit->GetFloatValue(UNIT_FIELD_COMBATREACH);\n\
      bool hasCollision = manager->CheckSphereCollision(unit->GetGUID(), unitRadius,\
      \ 2001, 2.5f);\nif (hasCollision) {\n    // Prevent movement or adjust path\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger obstacle avoidance system and may
    be used in conjunction with other methods like GetObstaclePosition() or UpdateObstacles().
    The implementation probably uses Euclidean distance calculations for efficiency.
    Performance can be affected if called frequently during pathfinding operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the center identifiers passed to this method are valid and
    correspond to actual obstacles in the system. Passing invalid identifiers may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect collision detection results. Also, be
    aware that floating-point precision errors might affect very small differences
    in distance calculations.
