  method: UpdatePath
  signature: void SmartAI::UpdatePath(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current path for the SmartAI instance based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdatePath method is responsible for advancing the movement path
    of a creature controlled by SmartAI. It processes the path data and updates the
    AI's internal state to reflect the creature's current position along the path.
    This method is typically called during each AI update cycle and uses the provided
    time delta (diff) to determine how much progress has been made along the path.
    The method handles path completion, waypoint transitions, and triggers any associated
    events or actions defined in the SmartAI script.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic UpdatePath Usage
    code: "void CreatureAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_SmartAI)\n        m_SmartAI->UpdatePath(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the AI update loop. It assumes
    that path data is already initialized and valid. The diff parameter represents
    milliseconds elapsed since last update, which affects movement speed calculations.
  warnings: Do not call UpdatePath directly without ensuring proper initialization
    of the path data. Incorrect handling of the diff parameter can cause erratic movement
    behavior or path skipping.
