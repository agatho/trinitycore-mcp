  class: PriestAI
  method: GetMana
  signature: int PriestAI::GetMana()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current mana amount of the priest AI instance.
  description: The GetMana method returns the current mana value of the PriestAI instance.
    This method is typically used within the AI logic to determine whether the priest
    has sufficient mana to cast spells or perform mana-intensive abilities. The returned
    value represents the actual current mana points available for use by the AI-controlled
    priest. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current mana amount of the PriestAI instance.
    The value typically ranges from 0 up to the maximum mana capacity of the priest,
    which depends on the character's level, equipment, and class-specific modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int currentMana = priestAI->GetMana();\nif (currentMana > 50) {\n    //\
      \ Cast a spell that requires at least 50 mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Check for Spell Casting
    code: "void PriestAI::CastHealSpell() {\n    int mana = GetMana();\n    if (mana\
      \ >= 100) {\n        // Cast Greater Heal\n    } else if (mana >= 50) {\n  \
      \      // Cast Heal\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PriestAI class and should only be called on valid
    PriestAI instances. The returned value may vary dynamically as the AI performs
    actions or receives damage over time. It's recommended to cache this value if
    it will be used multiple times within a single AI decision cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the PriestAI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling GetMana on an uninitialized or invalid instance may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect values. This method does not perform any validation
    of the internal mana state, so it's possible for the returned value to be inconsistent
    with actual game state if other systems modify the mana without proper synchronization.
