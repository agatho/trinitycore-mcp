documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the lifetime of the script instance. This method
    is automatically invoked when a PlayerScript object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this ensures proper
    cleanup of event handlers and references to player data structures. The destructor
    does not take any parameters and performs no explicit actions beyond standard
    object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PlayerScript* script = new PlayerScript();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor\
      \ is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, allowing proper cleanup
    of derived script classes. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
