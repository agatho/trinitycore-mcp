  method: GetSlope
  signature: float DifficultyCurve::GetSlope() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the slope value of the difficulty curve used for scaling game content.
  description: The GetSlope method retrieves the slope component of a DifficultyCurve
    object, which is typically used in World of Warcraft's content scaling system
    to determine how difficulty increases or decreases relative to player level or
    other factors. This value plays a critical role in calculating dynamic difficulty
    adjustments for dungeons, raids, and world encounters. The method does not accept
    any parameters and returns a floating-point number representing the slope coefficient.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other curve-related methods to compute
    adjusted values for damage, health, or experience rewards based on player progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the slope of the difficulty curve. This value
    typically defines the rate of change in difficulty metrics as player level or
    progression advances. Negative values may indicate decreasing difficulty, while
    positive values suggest increasing difficulty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      float slope = curve.GetSlope();

      printf("Difficulty slope: %.2f\n", slope);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Slope for Scaling Calculation
    code: 'DifficultyCurve dungeonCurve;

      float baseDamage = 100.0f;

      float slope = dungeonCurve.GetSlope();

      float scaledDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f + slope * playerLevel);

      printf("Scaled damage: %.2f\n", scaledDamage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger difficulty scaling system that may involve
    multiple curve components including intercept, slope, and maximum values. The
    slope value should be interpreted in context with other curve parameters to determine
    the full behavior of the scaling function.
