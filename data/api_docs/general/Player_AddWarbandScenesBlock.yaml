documentation:
  brief: Adds a warband scenes block to the player's collection.
  description: This method adds a specific warband scenes block value to the player's
    collection, allowing them to unlock and access various warband content related
    to scenes. The method is typically used in conjunction with other warband-related
    functions to manage player progression and content unlocks within the game. It
    operates on the principle that each block represents a unique identifier for a
    specific scene or set of scenes within the warband system.

  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's warband scene unlock system,
    where blockValue represents a specific scene identifier. Implementation details
    may involve internal tracking of unlocked scenes and potential synchronization
    with server-side data structures.
