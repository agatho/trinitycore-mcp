documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature ignores feign death mechanics.
  description: This method checks if a creature is configured to ignore the feign
    death mechanic, which is a game feature that allows certain creatures to avoid
    being affected by the feign death ability. The feign death ability typically causes
    a creature to become immune to certain effects or to be unable to take damage
    from specific sources. This method returns true if the creature is set to ignore
    such mechanics, false otherwise. It is commonly used in creature AI implementations
    to determine whether a creature should bypass normal feign death behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature ignores feign death mechanics, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature's AI logic allows it to bypass
    the standard feign death effects that would normally apply to it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsIgnoringFeignDeath()) {\n    // Creature will ignore feign\
      \ death\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with creature AI logic and may
    be part of a larger set of mechanics that control how creatures respond to various
    game effects. It should be used carefully when implementing AI behavior, as it
    affects how creatures interact with player abilities.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect the creature's health or status;
    it simply determines whether the creature ignores feign death mechanics. Care
    should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    to avoid unexpected behavior in creature interactions.
