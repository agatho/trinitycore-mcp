  class: FollowAction
  method: GetFollowTarget
  signature: ::Unit * FollowAction::GetFollowTarget(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit that the bot is currently following in the FollowAction.
  description: The GetFollowTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object that
    represents the target the bot is following. This method is typically used within
    the context of a BotAI system where bots follow specific units, such as players
    or other NPCs. The returned Unit pointer can be null if no valid follow target
    exists or if the bot is not currently following any unit. This method does not
    perform any validation on the target's existence or validity beyond returning
    what was previously set by the FollowAction logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ::Unit object that represents the current follow target,
    or nullptr if no valid target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI
    code: "BotAI* ai = ...;\nUnit* target = followAction.GetFollowTarget(ai);\nif\
      \ (target)\n{\n    // Bot is following a valid target\n    std::cout << \"Following\
      \ target with GUID: \" << target->GetGUID().ToString() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any checks to verify if the returned Unit is
    still alive or valid. It simply returns the last known follow target as set by
    the FollowAction logic. Developers should ensure proper null checking before using
    the returned pointer.
  warnings: Using the returned Unit pointer without verifying it's not null may lead
    to crashes or undefined behavior. The returned pointer might become invalid if
    the target unit is destroyed or removed from the game world.
