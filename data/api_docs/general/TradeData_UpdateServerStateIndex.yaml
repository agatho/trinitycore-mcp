documentation:
  brief: Updates the server state index for trade data, synchronizing internal trade
    state with the game server.
  description: The UpdateServerStateIndex method is responsible for updating the server-side
    state index associated with trade data within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures that any changes made to a player's trade state are properly synchronized
    with the game server's internal tracking mechanisms. It typically handles the
    updating of trade confirmation states, item availability, and other trade-related
    metadata that must be consistent across the server. The method is generally invoked
    during trade operations such as accepting or canceling trades, and it helps maintain
    data integrity in multi-threaded environments where concurrent trade operations
    may occur.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade State Update
    code: 'TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeData->UpdateServerStateIndex();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore trade system
    and should not usually be invoked directly by external code. It may perform synchronization
    operations that could impact performance if called excessively in rapid succession.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of established trade flow logic
    can lead to inconsistent trade states or server-side errors. Ensure proper trade
    state management before calling this method.
