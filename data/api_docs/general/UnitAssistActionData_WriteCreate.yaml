  class: UnitAssistActionData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void UnitAssistActionData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Unit
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes unit assist action data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player
    client.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the UnitAssistActionData object into
    a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission to a specific player client.
    This method is typically used when sending assist action information related to
    a unit (such as a creature or NPC) to a player's client, enabling the client to
    properly display or handle assist-related actions in the game world. The serialization
    process includes relevant data fields that define the assist action's properties
    and state. This method requires both an owner unit and a receiving player to determine
    proper data formatting and potential filtering based on player visibility or permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized assist action data
      will be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets
      sent to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit that owns or is associated with this assist action
      data. Used to determine what information should be included in the serialization
      based on the owner's state and properties.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive this assist action data. This
      parameter is used to apply player-specific filtering or formatting when serializing
      the data for transmission.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'UnitAssistActionData assistData;

      ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player reference

      Unit* unitOwner = ...;     // Get unit reference

      assistData.WriteCreate(buffer, unitOwner, targetPlayer);

      // Buffer now contains serialized assist data ready for network transmission'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should only be called when preparing data for network transmission. The method
    assumes that all pointers are valid and not null, as it does not perform null
    checks. It may perform visibility or permission checks internally based on the
    receiver player's state.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or null pointers as it may lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the ByteBuffer is properly initialized before
    calling this method, and that the owner and receiver parameters are valid objects
    within the game world context.
