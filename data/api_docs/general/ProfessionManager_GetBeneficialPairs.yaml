    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of beneficial skill pairs associated with a specified
    profession.
  description: The GetBeneficialPairs method returns an integer value representing
    the count of beneficial skill pairs for the given profession. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this method is typically used to determine how many skill
    combinations provide mutual benefits or synergies within a specific crafting profession.
    This information can be crucial for determining optimal skill allocation, crafting
    efficiency, or understanding the interdependencies between different skills in
    a profession. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in
    nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of beneficial pairs associated with
    the specified profession. Returns zero if no beneficial pairs exist for the given
    profession or if the profession type is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int beneficialPairs = professionManager.GetBeneficialPairs(PROFESSION_ENGINERING);

      std::cout << "Engineering has " << beneficialPairs << " beneficial pairs." <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that map professions
    to their respective beneficial skill pair configurations. The implementation may
    cache results for performance reasons, and the exact definition of 'beneficial
    pairs' is dependent on the game's crafting system logic.
