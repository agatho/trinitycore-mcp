    adtId, int32 groupId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the WMOAreaTableEntry for a given root, adt, and group ID.
  description: The GetWMOAreaTable method is used to fetch a WMOAreaTableEntry from
    the database based on the provided rootId, adtId, and groupId parameters. This
    method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to determine
    area-specific properties related to WMO (World Map Object) files. These entries
    define how areas behave in terms of terrain, skyboxes, and other environmental
    features. The method performs a lookup using the provided identifiers and returns
    a pointer to the corresponding entry if found, or nullptr if no matching entry
    exists. This is essential for handling area-based triggers, environment effects,
    and map-related logic within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: rootId
    description: The root identifier of the WMO group. This typically corresponds
      to a specific WMO file or section within the game's map data structure.
  - name: adtId
    description: The ADT (Area Data Table) identifier, which represents a specific
      chunk of the game world's terrain data.
  - name: groupId
    description: The group identifier within the WMO structure. This defines a particular
      section or component of the WMO that is associated with an area.
  returns: A pointer to a const WMOAreaTableEntry if a matching entry is found, otherwise
    nullptr. The returned pointer should not be modified and represents immutable
    data about the WMO area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve WMO area information
    code: "const WMOAreaTableEntry* wmoEntry = sDB2Manager->GetWMOAreaTable(100, 200,\
      \ 300);\nif (wmoEntry != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the WMO area data\n   \
      \ printf(\"Found WMO Area: %d\\n\", wmoEntry->ID);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      No WMO area found for given IDs.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DB2Manager class and relies on pre-loaded DB2
    data files containing WMO area table entries. It's thread-safe as long as the
    underlying database loading is complete before concurrent access begins. The method
    performs a fast lookup using internal indexing, so performance should be consistent.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided rootId, adtId, and groupId values are valid identifiers
    from the game's data files. Passing invalid or out-of-range IDs may result in
    returning nullptr without error indication. This method does not validate input
    parameters beyond basic lookup logic.
