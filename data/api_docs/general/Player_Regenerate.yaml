documentation:
  brief: Regenerates player's power based on specified amount
  description: The Regenerate method in TrinityCore's Player class handles the regeneration
    of a player's power (mana, rage, focus, or energy) based on the provided parameter.
    This method is typically used to restore power values during gameplay, such as
    when a player's power is depleted and needs to be replenished. It operates within
    the context of game mechanics where power regeneration occurs over time or through
    specific actions like spell casting or abilities. The method may also be used
    in conjunction with other power-related methods for comprehensive power management.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The amount of power to regenerate, typically representing the quantity
      of mana, rage, focus, or energy to restore. Valid values are positive integers,
      with negative values potentially causing unexpected behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Regeneration Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->Regenerate(50);

      // This restores 50 units of power to the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by game systems during gameplay,
    such as when a player's power is depleted and needs to be replenished. It may
    also be used in conjunction with other methods like GetPower or SetPower for complete
    power management. Performance considerations include potential impact on server
    load if used excessively.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without understanding of the
    game mechanics involved, as improper usage can lead to unexpected behavior or
    power imbalance. Common mistakes include calling it with negative values or without
    proper context.
