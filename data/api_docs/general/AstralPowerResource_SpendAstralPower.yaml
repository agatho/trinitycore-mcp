  class: AstralPowerResource
  method: SpendAstralPower
  signature: bool AstralPowerResource::SpendAstralPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of Astral Power from the resource.
  description: The SpendAstralPower method attempts to deduct a given amount of Astral
    Power from the current resource pool. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    where abilities or spells consume Astral Power as their resource cost. The operation
    will succeed only if sufficient Astral Power is available in the resource. If
    the requested amount exceeds the available power, the method returns false without
    modifying the resource. This method is commonly invoked during spell casting or
    ability usage to ensure proper resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of Astral Power was successfully deducted
    from the resource; otherwise, returns false if there was insufficient power to
    fulfill the request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetAstralPowerResource()->SpendAstralPower(50)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ spent 50 Astral Power\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_MYSTIC_BUFF);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough Astral Power\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not\
      \ enough Astral Power!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spending
    code: "uint32 requiredPower = 100;\nAstralPowerResource* resource = player->GetAstralPowerResource();\n\
      if (resource->GetAstralPower() >= requiredPower && resource->SpendAstralPower(requiredPower))\
      \ {\n    // Execute ability that costs 100 Astral Power\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ELEMENTAL_BLAST);\n} else {\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Insufficient\
      \ Astral Power for this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly interact with the game's UI or send messages
    to the client. It only modifies internal resource values. The method assumes that
    the resource object is valid and properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the resource object is not null before calling this method.
    Also, be aware that spending power may affect spell casting success or ability
    activation, so always verify sufficient resources before attempting to spend them.
