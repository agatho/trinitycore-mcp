documentation:
  brief: Initializes the instance script when a new instance is created.
  description: The Create method is called when a new instance of a dungeon or raid
    is initialized. This method serves as the primary entry point for setting up instance-specific
    data, including initializing variables, registering event handlers, and preparing
    the world state for the encounter. It is typically invoked by the core framework
    during instance creation and is crucial for proper instance management within
    TrinityCore. The method should be overridden in custom instance scripts to perform
    initialization logic specific to that instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Instance Script Initialization
    code: "class BossInstance : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    BossInstance(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n    \n    void Create() override\n    {\n \
      \       // Initialize instance variables\n        _bossesKilled = 0;\n     \
      \   _instanceStarted = true;\n        \n        // Register events or set up\
      \ objectives\n        ScheduleEvent(EVENT_CHECK_BOSS, 1000);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called exactly once per instance creation and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to call the parent class's Create() method if
    overriding it in a derived class. The method executes before any other instance
    logic, so it's safe to initialize all necessary variables here.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy operations or blocking calls within this method as
    it may impact instance loading performance. Avoid calling methods that require
    the instance to be fully initialized, as the instance state might not be ready
    yet.
