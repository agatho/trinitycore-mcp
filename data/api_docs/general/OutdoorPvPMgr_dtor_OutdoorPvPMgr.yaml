  brief: Destroys an OutdoorPvPMgr instance and cleans up all associated outdoor PvP
    systems.
  description: The destructor for the OutdoorPvPMgr class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all resources associated with outdoor PvP systems managed by this
    manager. It ensures that all active OutdoorPvP instances are safely destroyed,
    any registered callbacks are removed, and memory allocated for tracking outdoor
    PvP zones is freed. This method is automatically invoked when an OutdoorPvPMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor plays a critical
    role in preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper cleanup during server shutdown
    or when the manager is no longer needed.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope exit
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    OutdoorPvPMgr* mgr = new OutdoorPvPMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called here\n\
      }\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    OutdoorPvPMgr\
      \ mgr;\n    // ... use the manager ...\n    // Destructor automatically called\
      \ when mgr goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    server stability. It should not be called manually unless explicitly deleting
    a dynamically allocated OutdoorPvPMgr instance. The destruction process may involve
    iterating through all registered outdoor PvP systems and calling their destructors,
    which could have performance implications if many systems are active.
