documentation:
  brief: Adds an object to the map's update list for processing.
  description: The AddUpdateObject method is responsible for adding a given Object
    to the map's internal update list, which is used during the map's update cycle.
    This method ensures that the object will be processed and updated according to
    the game mechanics and map's update logic. The method typically called internally
    by the game engine when an object needs to be added to the map's update system,
    such as when a player or creature enters the map's boundaries. It is crucial for
    maintaining synchronization between the object and its associated map.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: A pointer to the Object that needs to be added to the map's update
      list. This object can be any type of game object such as a player, creature,
      or game object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      Object* obj = new Object();

      map->AddUpdateObject(obj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during the object's initialization or when
    it enters a map's boundaries. It should be noted that this method does not immediately
    update the object; instead, it schedules the object for update during the next
    update cycle of the map.
