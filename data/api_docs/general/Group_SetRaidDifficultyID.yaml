  signature: void Group::SetRaidDifficultyID(int difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the raid difficulty ID for the group.
  description: The SetRaidDifficultyID method configures the difficulty level for
    a raid group in World of Warcraft. This method is used to adjust the encounter
    difficulties that players will face when entering raid instances. The difficulty
    ID corresponds to predefined raid difficulties such as normal, heroic, and mythic
    modes. When invoked, this method updates the internal difficulty setting of the
    group and may propagate the change to all group members. It's typically called
    during raid creation or when a leader wants to adjust the difficulty of an existing
    raid instance.
  parameters:
  - name: difficulty
    description: The difficulty ID to set for the raid. Valid values are typically
      1-4 for normal, heroic, and mythic difficulties, though exact values depend
      on the game version and expansion. A value of 0 usually indicates no difficulty
      set or default behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting raid to heroic difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetRaidDifficultyID(2);\
      \ // Set to heroic difficulty\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting raid to mythic difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    group->SetRaidDifficultyID(3); // Set to mythic difficulty\n    // Notify\
      \ players of the change\n    group->SendUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on raid groups, not party groups. The difficulty
    ID values are defined by the game's difficulty system and may vary between different
    expansions or patches. Changes to raid difficulty are typically propagated to
    all group members automatically.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-raid group will likely have no effect or
    could cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the difficulty value is valid for
    the current expansion before setting it, as invalid values might not be handled
    gracefully by the game engine.
