  class: GroupCoordination
  method: BroadcastCommand
  signature: void GroupCoordination::BroadcastCommand(CoordinationCommand command,
    const int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a coordination command to all group members within the specified target
    scope.
  description: The BroadcastCommand method is used to propagate a given CoordinationCommand
    to all eligible group members based on the provided targets parameter. This functionality
    is typically utilized in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raid coordination,
    instance management, or synchronized actions. The method ensures that commands
    are delivered consistently across the group, maintaining synchronization between
    players. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's group management system
    and relies on proper group membership validation before broadcasting.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: The CoordinationCommand enum value representing the specific action
      or instruction to be broadcasted to group members.
  - name: targets
    description: An integer reference specifying the target scope for the broadcast.
      Valid values typically represent different group member categories such as all
      members, raid members, or specific roles within the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a Ready Check to All Group Members
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      CoordinationCommand readyCheck = CoordinationCommand::READY_CHECK;

      int allMembers = 0xFF; // Assuming 0xFF represents all group members

      coordination.BroadcastCommand(readyCheck, allMembers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send a Pull Command to Raid Members Only
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      CoordinationCommand pull = CoordinationCommand::PULL;

      int raidMembers = 0x02; // Assuming 0x02 represents raid members only

      coordination.BroadcastCommand(pull, raidMembers);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling object has valid group context and that
    the targets parameter correctly maps to supported group member scopes. The implementation
    likely uses internal group messaging systems and may involve serialization of
    command data for network transmission.
  warnings: Improperly setting the targets parameter can result in commands being
    sent to unintended group members or no one at all. Ensure that target values align
    with expected enum or bitfield representations used by the GroupCoordination system.
