  class: InventoryManager
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void InventoryManager::UpdateMetrics(int startTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal inventory metrics and statistics based on the provided start
    time.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recalculating and refreshing
    various inventory-related performance indicators and statistical data within the
    InventoryManager class. This method typically processes inventory changes, tracks
    usage patterns, and updates internal counters or caches that are used for optimization
    and reporting purposes. It may be invoked during periodic maintenance intervals,
    after significant inventory operations, or in response to specific game events
    that affect item distribution or player inventory states. The method uses the
    provided start time parameter to determine the time range for which metrics should
    be calculated or updated.
  parameters:
  - name: startTime
    description: An integer value representing the starting timestamp in seconds since
      epoch. This parameter defines the beginning of the time interval for which inventory
      metrics should be updated and calculated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventoryMgr = player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager();

      inventoryMgr->UpdateMetrics(time(nullptr));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Custom Time Interval
    code: 'time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);

      int oneHourAgo = currentTime - 3600; // One hour ago

      inventoryMgr->UpdateMetrics(oneHourAgo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform intensive calculations and should be called judiciously
    to avoid performance degradation. It's typically designed to be thread-safe when
    used with proper synchronization mechanisms. The method might cache results for
    performance optimization, so repeated calls with the same time range may return
    cached data.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or future timestamps may result in incorrect
    metric calculations or undefined behavior. Ensure that the startTime parameter
    represents a valid historical point in time relative to the current system time.
