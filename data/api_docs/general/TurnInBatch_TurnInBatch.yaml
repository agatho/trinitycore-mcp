  class: TurnInBatch
  method: TurnInBatch
  signature: void TurnInBatch::TurnInBatch(uint32 bGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the turn-in of a batch quest for the specified GUID.
  description: The TurnInBatch method handles the completion and reward distribution
    for a batch quest associated with the given GUID. This method is typically invoked
    when a player completes a set of objectives within a batch quest, triggering the
    necessary updates to the player's quest log, achievement tracking, and reward
    distribution. It ensures that all quest-related data is properly synchronized
    and that rewards such as experience points, items, or currency are awarded to
    the player. The method operates on the assumption that the quest has already been
    started and that all prerequisites for completion have been met.
  parameters:
  - name: bGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the batch quest to be turned in.
      This value must correspond to a valid active quest in the player's quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 questGuid = player->GetQuestSlot(0);

      TurnInBatch::TurnInBatch(questGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the batch quest is fully completed
    and all objectives are satisfied. It does not validate the completion state of
    individual quest objectives; it assumes that validation has already occurred.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the quest is actually complete
    may result in incorrect quest state updates or reward distribution. Ensure that
    all prerequisites for quest completion have been met before invoking TurnInBatch.
