documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the UnitAI object
  description: The GetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier associated
    with the UnitAI instance. In TrinityCore's architecture, every game object including
    players, creatures, and game objects has a unique GUID that distinguishes it from
    all other objects in the world. This method is commonly used for object identification,
    tracking, and referencing within AI logic and general gameplay systems. The returned
    value represents the internal GUID of the unit which can be used to uniquely identify
    this specific UnitAI instance across the entire game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the UnitAI object.
    This is typically a 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies the unit within
    the TrinityCore world state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID Retrieval
    code: 'UnitAI* ai = GetUnitAI();

      int guid = ai->GetGUID();

      printf("Unit GUID: %d\n", guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Object Lookup
    code: "UnitAI* ai = GetUnitAI();\nint guid = ai->GetGUID();\nif (guid != 0)\n\
      {\n    Unit* unit = sObjectAccessor->GetUnit(*ai, guid);\n    if (unit)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Perform operations on the retrieved unit\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is consistent throughout the lifetime of
    the UnitAI object. It's important to note that in TrinityCore, GUIDs are managed
    by the server and are guaranteed to be unique across all objects in the world.
    The method should not be called on destroyed or invalid UnitAI instances as it
    may return unexpected values.
  warnings: This method assumes the UnitAI instance is valid and properly initialized.
    Calling GetGUID on a null or destroyed UnitAI object could result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect GUID values. Always validate that the UnitAI pointer is
    valid before calling this method.
