documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's PvP flag status to enable or disable PvP mechanics.
  description: The SetPvP method toggles the player's PvP flag status, which determines
    whether the player can engage in PvP combat and whether they are subject to PvP
    penalties. When enabled, the player enters a PvP state where they can be attacked
    by other players and their actions are affected by PvP mechanics such as reduced
    reputation gains and potential loss of items upon death. This method is commonly
    used during player versus player activities or when setting up player characters
    for PvP content.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the PvP flag. True sets the player in PvP state, false removes the PvP flag.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPvP(true); // Enable PvP flag

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->GetPvPFlag()) {\n    player->SetPvP(false);\n\
      } else {\n    player->SetPvP(true);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's PvP flag state and affects their
    gameplay behavior in World of Warcraft. It should be used carefully as it impacts
    player character mechanics, including death penalties and reputation changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unintended consequences such as
    players being unable to engage in PvP combat or having their PvP status incorrectly
    set, which may affect gameplay experience and character progression.
