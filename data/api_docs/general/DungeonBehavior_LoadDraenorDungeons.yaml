documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all Dragonflight dungeon data into the behavior system
  description: The LoadDraenorDungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all Dragonflight-era dungeon configurations and behaviors within the DungeonBehavior
    system. This method typically handles the setup of dungeon-specific parameters,
    difficulty settings, spawn rules, and quest requirements that are unique to the
    Draenor expansion content. It ensures that all relevant dungeon data is properly
    registered and available for use when players enter or interact with these dungeons.
    The method likely reads from configuration files or database entries containing
    dungeon definitions and prepares internal data structures for dungeon management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DungeonBehavior behavior;

      behavior.LoadDraenorDungeons();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    the dungeon behavior system is first instantiated. It may perform database queries
    or file I/O operations, so calling it in performance-critical sections should
    be avoided. The method likely modifies internal state and should not be called
    multiple times without proper cleanup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that dungeon data is properly initialized
    before calling other dungeon-related methods that depend on this data.
