  class: BotProfiler
  method: SyncWithPerformanceMonitor
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithPerformanceMonitor()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes bot performance data with the global performance monitor to
    track and analyze AI behavior efficiency.
  description: The SyncWithPerformanceMonitor method updates the global performance
    monitoring system with collected bot profiling data. This synchronization allows
    administrators and developers to analyze the computational overhead and efficiency
    of AI behaviors within the game environment. The method typically aggregates timing
    information, resource usage statistics, and other performance metrics from individual
    bot instances and submits them to a central performance tracking mechanism. It
    ensures that profiling data is consistently updated and available for real-time
    monitoring or post-processing analysis.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Synchronization Call
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithPerformanceMonitor();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called at regular intervals or after significant
    AI behavior execution to maintain accurate performance tracking. It may involve
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when updating shared performance data
    structures.
  warnings: Improper synchronization can lead to inconsistent performance data or
    race conditions in multi-threaded environments. Ensure that this method is not
    called excessively during high-frequency AI updates as it might introduce performance
    overhead.
