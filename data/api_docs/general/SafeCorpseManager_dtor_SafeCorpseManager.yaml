  method: ~SafeCorpseManager
  signature: void SafeCorpseManager::~SafeCorpseManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SafeCorpseManager instance and cleans up associated corpse data.
  description: The ~SafeCorpseManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources managed by the SafeCorpseManager class. This includes releasing
    any memory allocated for corpse data structures, removing references to player
    corpses from internal tracking systems, and ensuring that no dangling pointers
    or memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures that when a SafeCorpseManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, all associated corpse-related
    data is properly disposed of to maintain system stability and prevent resource
    exhaustion.

  - title: Automatic destruction of SafeCorpseManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SafeCorpseManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    a SafeCorpseManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers
    should not manually call this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. The destruction process ensures that all corpse references are properly
    cleaned up without causing crashes or data corruption.
