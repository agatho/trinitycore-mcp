  class: InterruptManager
  method: AssignInterruptRoles
  signature: void InterruptManager::AssignInterruptRoles(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns interrupt roles to group members based on their current status and
    permissions.
  description: The AssignInterruptRoles method configures which group members are
    allowed to interrupt spells or abilities within a group context. This method typically
    manages role-based access control for spell interruption mechanics in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the provided group member data
    and assigns appropriate interrupt permissions, ensuring that only eligible players
    can perform spell interrupts during group activities such as raids or dungeons.
    The method is commonly invoked when group composition changes or when new members
    join a group.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of group members
      whose interrupt roles need to be assigned. This value determines how many players
      will have their interrupt permissions configured.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      int numMembers = 5;

      interruptMgr.AssignInterruptRoles(numMembers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Group Size
    code: "InterruptManager interruptMgr;\nGroup* group = player->GetGroup();\nif\
      \ (group)\n{\n    int memberCount = group->GetMembersCount();\n    interruptMgr.AssignInterruptRoles(memberCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems and may
    require the calling context to have appropriate permissions. The exact implementation
    details depend on how TrinityCore handles group roles and spell interruption logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupMembers parameter is valid and represents a realistic
    number of players; passing invalid values could lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect role assignments.
