  method: GetCurrentVersion
  signature: std::string PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetCurrentVersion()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current version string of the playerbot migration manager.
  description: The GetCurrentVersion method returns a std::string representing the
    current version of the playerbot migration process. This version string is typically
    used to track which migration stage or version of the playerbot system is currently
    active within the TrinityCore environment. The method does not take any parameters
    and is designed to provide a consistent interface for checking the state of playerbot
    migrations. It is commonly used during server startup, configuration updates,
    or when debugging playerbot-related issues to ensure compatibility between different
    versions of the playerbot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the current version identifier of the playerbot
    migration manager. The format and content of this string depend on the internal
    implementation but typically represents a semantic version or build identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::string version = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->GetCurrentVersion();\n\
      if (!version.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Current playerbot migration version:\
      \ \" << version << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No migration version\
      \ found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a singleton pattern, requiring access through
    an instance retrieval mechanism. The returned string should be treated as read-only
    and may not be modified directly by calling code.
