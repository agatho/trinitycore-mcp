documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified pool is empty
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if a given pool identified by its pool_id
    contains no active entries. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic
    object spawning and cleanup in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, particularly
    when dealing with creature, gameobject, or loot pools that are managed through
    the PoolMgr system. The method returns true if the pool has no active or pending
    entries, and false otherwise. It does not modify any internal state but provides
    a read-only check on the pool's current status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified pool is empty (contains no active entries),
    false if it contains at least one entry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a creature pool is empty
    code: "if (sPoolMgr->IsEmpty(12345)) {\n    // Pool 12345 is empty, safe to perform\
      \ cleanup or re-population\n    sPoolMgr->AddPoolEntry(12345, 67890, 1.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty in a loop to manage multiple pools
    code: "uint32 poolIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : poolIds) {\n \
      \   if (sPoolMgr->IsEmpty(id)) {\n        sPoolMgr->AddPoolEntry(id, 5000 +\
      \ id, 1.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup and does not involve any locking mechanisms
    in most implementations, so it should be used carefully in multi-threaded contexts
    where pool state might change concurrently. The pool_id parameter must refer to
    an existing pool managed by the PoolMgr; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Using IsEmpty on a non-existent pool_id may lead to undefined behavior
    or assertion failures depending on implementation details. Always ensure that
    the pool_id exists before calling this method.
