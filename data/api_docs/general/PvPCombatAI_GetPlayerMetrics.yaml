  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: GetPlayerMetrics
  signature: const PvPMetrics & PvPCombatAI::GetPlayerMetrics(uint32 playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the PvP metrics associated with a specific player.
  description: The GetPlayerMetrics method retrieves the PvPMetrics structure for
    a given player identified by their GUID. This structure typically contains statistics
    and performance data related to player-versus-player combat activities within
    the game. The method is designed to provide access to detailed PvP-related information
    that may be used for scoring, ranking, or gameplay analytics. It is commonly used
    in PvP combat AI systems to evaluate player performance and adjust behavior accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PvPMetrics object containing the player's PvP
    statistics and performance data. The returned reference is valid only as long
    as the underlying data structure remains in scope and should not be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PvPMetrics const& metrics = combatAI->GetPlayerMetrics(12345);

      uint32 kills = metrics.Kills;

      uint32 deaths = metrics.Deaths;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "PvPMetrics const& playerMetrics = combatAI->GetPlayerMetrics(playerGuid);\n\
      float kdr = static_cast<float>(playerMetrics.Kills) / static_cast<float>(playerMetrics.Deaths);\n\
      if (kdr > 3.0f)\n{\n    // Player is considered a high KDR PvP player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal player data structures that are maintained
    by the TrinityCore PvP system. The returned PvPMetrics reference should be used
    carefully as it points to internal data that may change during gameplay. Ensure
    proper synchronization if accessing from multiple threads.
  warnings: The method signature indicates this is a const method, meaning it should
    not modify internal state. However, accessing metrics might involve internal lookups
    or caching mechanisms that could impact performance if called excessively in tight
    loops. Avoid frequent calls in high-frequency update contexts.
