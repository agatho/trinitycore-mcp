  brief: Copies the state and configuration of another BotSpawner instance
  description: The BotSpawner copy constructor initializes a new BotSpawner object
    by copying all relevant state and configuration data from an existing BotSpawner
    instance. This method ensures that the newly created instance maintains identical
    spawner settings, including bot templates, spawn locations, and behavioral parameters.
    The copy operation is essential for creating duplicate spawner configurations
    without manually redefining all properties. This constructor typically operates
    within the context of AI-based bot management systems in TrinityCore, where multiple
    spawners may need to share similar configurations while maintaining independent
    operational states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Copy of an Existing BotSpawner
    code: 'BotSpawner originalSpawner;

      // Configure originalSpawner...

      BotSpawner copiedSpawner(originalSpawner); // Uses copy constructor

      // copiedSpawner now has identical configuration to originalSpawner'
    language: cpp
  notes: This copy constructor performs a shallow copy of the BotSpawner's internal
    state. If the class contains pointers or dynamic memory allocations, developers
    should verify that deep copying behavior is implemented as needed. The method
    assumes that the source BotSpawner instance is in a valid state before copying.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an uninitialized or corrupted BotSpawner instance
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the source parameter is properly
    initialized before invoking this copy constructor to avoid potential memory issues
    or invalid configuration states.
