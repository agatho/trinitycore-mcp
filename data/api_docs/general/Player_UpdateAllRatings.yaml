documentation:
  brief: Updates all combat ratings for the player based on current stats and equipment.
  description: The UpdateAllRatings method recalculates and applies all combat ratings
    for a Player object. This includes melee, ranged, and spell combat ratings such
    as hit chance, critical strike chance, expertise, and other related statistics.
    The method is typically invoked when a player's equipment changes, level up occurs,
    or stat modifiers are applied. It ensures that the player's combat effectiveness
    is accurately reflected in the game's combat system by updating internal rating
    values used for damage calculations and hit probabilities.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls individual rating update functions for each
    combat type. It should be called after any change that affects player stats or
