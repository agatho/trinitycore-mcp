  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: LoadConfig
  signature: bool BotLevelDistribution::LoadConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the bot level distribution configuration from the database
    or file.
  description: The LoadConfig method is responsible for loading the bot level distribution
    settings used by the TrinityCore AI system. This method typically reads configuration
    data that defines how bots should be distributed across different levels within
    the game world. It may load data from a database table, configuration file, or
    in-memory cache. The method ensures that all necessary parameters for bot level
    distribution are properly initialized before the AI system begins assigning levels
    to bots. The configuration might include settings such as minimum and maximum
    bot levels, probability distributions, or scaling factors based on player population.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the configuration was successfully loaded and parsed; returns
    false if the loading process failed due to missing data, invalid format, or database
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotLevelDistribution botDist;\nbool success = botDist.LoadConfig();\nif\
      \ (success)\n{\n    // Configuration loaded successfully\n    // Bot level distribution\
      \ is now ready for use\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle configuration loading failure\n\
      \    // Log error or fallback to defaults\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    the configuration needs to be refreshed. It's important to ensure that the underlying
    data source (database, config file) is accessible and contains valid data before
    calling this method. The method may perform database queries or file I/O operations
    which could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper error handling may lead to undefined
    behavior if the configuration is invalid or missing. Ensure that all required
    configuration entries exist in the data source, as failure to do so might cause
    bots to be assigned incorrect levels or fail to spawn altogether.
