documentation:
  brief: Teleports the caster to target location using leap motion.
  description: The EffectLeap method performs a teleportation action that moves the
    caster to a specific target location, typically used in spell effects that require
    immediate movement. This method is commonly associated with abilities that allow
    characters to leap to nearby positions or targets, often involving movement mechanics
    such as jump height or distance calculations. The implementation involves calculating
    the target position based on the caster's current location and applying movement
    to that point, which may include collision detection and ground positioning.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectLeap();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the caster to be in a valid state for movement,
    and may involve checking for obstacles or ground height before teleporting. Performance
    considerations include ensuring that teleportation does not cause issues with
    collision detection or movement restrictions.
  warnings: The method may fail if the target position is invalid or obstructed, potentially
    causing the spell to not execute correctly. Avoid using this method in scenarios
    where movement is restricted or when the caster is not in a valid state for movement.
