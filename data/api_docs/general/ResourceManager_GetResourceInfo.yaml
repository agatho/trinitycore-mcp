  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetResourceInfo
  signature: ResourceInfo ResourceManager::GetResourceInfo(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves detailed information about a specified resource type including
    its name, ID, and properties.
  description: The GetResourceInfo method retrieves comprehensive metadata for a given
    ResourceType. It provides access to essential resource details such as the resource's
    unique identifier, display name, and associated properties. This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage and query resource
    definitions during gameplay mechanics like crafting, quest progression, or spell
    effects. The method assumes that the resource type has been properly registered
    within the ResourceManager system before being queried.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourceInfo object containing detailed metadata about the requested
    resource type including its ID, name, and other relevant properties. Returns an
    empty ResourceInfo if the specified resource type is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ResourceInfo info = resourceManager.GetResourceInfo(ResourceType::Gold);

      std::cout << "Resource Name: " << info.name << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Resource ID: " << info.id << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Validity
    code: "ResourceInfo info = resourceManager.GetResourceInfo(ResourceType::IronOre);\n\
      if (!info.name.empty()) {\n    // Resource exists and is valid\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found resource: \" << info.name << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Resource\
      \ not found or invalid\n    std::cerr << \"Invalid resource type requested\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal registry. For optimal
    performance, avoid calling this method repeatedly in tight loops. The ResourceManager
    should be initialized before any calls to GetResourceInfo are made.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered ResourceType may return
    an empty ResourceInfo structure that could lead to runtime errors if not properly
    validated. Always check the returned object's validity before using its contents.
