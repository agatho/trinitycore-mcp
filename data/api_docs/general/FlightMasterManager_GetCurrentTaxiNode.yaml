  signature: uint32 FlightMasterManager::GetCurrentTaxiNode(Creature * flightMaster)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the current taxi node associated with
    the specified flight master creature.
  description: The GetCurrentTaxiNode method is used to obtain the identifier of the
    taxi node that is currently associated with a given flight master creature. This
    identifier corresponds to a specific location in the game world where the player
    can access flight paths. The method takes a pointer to a Creature object representing
    the flight master and returns a uint32 value that represents the taxi node's ID.
    This functionality is essential for managing flight path systems within World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, allowing the game to determine which nodes
    are available for taxi travel from a particular flight master.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) of the current taxi
    node associated with the flight master. This ID corresponds to a specific location
    in the game world where flight paths originate or terminate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 currentNodeId = flightMasterManager.GetCurrentTaxiNode(flightMasterCreature);\n\
      if (currentNodeId != 0)\n{\n    // Process taxi node\n    printf(\"Current taxi\
      \ node ID: %u\\n\", currentNodeId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with flight path management
    systems to determine which taxi nodes are accessible from a given flight master.
    The returned node ID can be used to query additional information about the taxi
    node, such as its location or connected destinations.
