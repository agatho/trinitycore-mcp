  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: UpdateSolo
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateSolo(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI behavior for a solo bot character.
  description: The UpdateSolo method is responsible for managing the artificial intelligence
    updates specific to a single bot character in the game. This method handles various
    aspects of bot behavior including movement, combat decisions, target selection,
    and interaction with the game world when the bot is operating independently without
    a group. It processes the bot's state machine and ensures that the AI logic is
    executed at regular intervals based on the provided time delta. The method typically
    runs within the game loop and integrates with TrinityCore's core AI systems to
    maintain consistent bot behavior.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic UpdateSolo Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& bot : botManager->GetAllBots())\n\
      \    {\n        if (bot->IsSolo())\n        {\n            bot->GetAI()->UpdateSolo(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop with appropriate
    time deltas. The implementation likely handles state transitions, pathfinding
    calculations, and decision-making processes specific to solo gameplay. Performance
    considerations include avoiding heavy computations within this method to maintain
    smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper bot initialization or when the bot
    is not in solo mode may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all required AI
    components are properly set up before invoking this method.
