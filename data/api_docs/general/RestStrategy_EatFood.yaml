  class: RestStrategy
  method: EatFood
  signature: bool RestStrategy::EatFood(BotAI * ai, Item * food)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should consume food based on its current hunger
    state and available items.
  description: The EatFood method evaluates if a bot AI should consume a specified
    food item. It checks the bot's current hunger level, the food item's properties,
    and whether consuming the food would be beneficial for the bot's health or stamina.
    This method is typically used within the context of bot behavior strategies to
    manage resource consumption and optimize gameplay efficiency. The method returns
    true if the bot should eat the food, false otherwise. It may consider factors
    such as the bot's current health/stamina levels, the food's healing properties,
    and whether the bot has sufficient inventory space for the item.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance representing the bot that is evaluating
      whether to eat food. This parameter provides access to the bot's state, inventory,
      and AI decision-making context.
  - name: food
    description: Pointer to an Item object representing the food item that the bot
      is considering consuming. The method will evaluate this item's properties such
      as healing value, duration, and usability.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should consume the specified food item based on
    its current state and needs; returns false otherwise. A return value of false
    may indicate that the bot is not hungry enough to benefit from eating, or that
    consuming the food would be detrimental to the bot's overall strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a bot AI context
    code: "if (restStrategy.EatFood(ai, foodItem)) {\n    ai->UseItem(foodItem);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple food items before consumption
    code: "for (auto& item : ai->GetInventory()->GetItems()) {\n    if (item->IsFood()\
      \ && restStrategy.EatFood(ai, item)) {\n        ai->UseItem(item);\n       \
      \ break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RestStrategy class which manages bot behavior
    related to resting and resource consumption. The implementation likely uses internal
    state tracking for the bot's hunger level, health status, and inventory management.
    It may also interact with the bot's AI decision tree to determine optimal timing
    for food consumption.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI and Item pointers passed to this method are valid
    and not null. Passing invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that frequent calls to this method without proper cooldowns may
    result in excessive resource consumption by bots.
