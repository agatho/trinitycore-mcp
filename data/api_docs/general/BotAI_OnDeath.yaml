  method: OnDeath
  signature: void BotAI::OnDeath()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the bot's behavior when it dies, including cleanup and potential
    respawn logic.
  description: The OnDeath method is invoked when a bot character in the TrinityCore
    world dies. This method manages the necessary cleanup operations such as removing
    the bot from active combat, resetting its AI state, and potentially triggering
    respawn or reassignment logic. It ensures that the bot's resources are properly
    released and that the game state remains consistent after the death event. The
    method is typically called by the core game loop when a bot's health reaches zero
    and cannot be revived.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI handler
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnDeath()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup tasks\n    BotAI::OnDeath();\n\
      \    // Additional custom logic for bot death\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI class and should not be called directly
    from outside the AI system. It's designed to be overridden or extended by derived
    classes to implement specific death behaviors. The method may interact with the
    bot's owner or group members depending on the configured behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that any custom implementation of OnDeath does not cause infinite
    loops or access invalid memory, especially if it interacts with other AI components
    or game objects that might have already been destroyed.
