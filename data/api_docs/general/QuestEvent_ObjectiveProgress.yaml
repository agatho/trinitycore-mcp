documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of a quest objective for a player
  description: The ObjectiveProgress method is used to increment or modify the progress
    of a specific quest objective for a given player. This method is typically invoked
    when a player interacts with game objects, kills creatures, or collects items
    that contribute to completing quest requirements. It updates the internal tracking
    of quest progress and ensures that the player's quest log reflects the current
    state of their objectives. The method returns a QuestEvent object which can be
    used for chaining operations or further processing of quest-related events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The player identifier (GUID) of the player whose quest progress is
      being updated
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the objective progress
      is being modified
  - name: objId
    description: The identifier of the specific quest objective being progressed (e.g.,
      creature entry, item entry, or objective index)
  - name: count
    description: The amount by which to increment or decrement the objective progress.
      Positive values increase progress, negative values decrease it
  returns: Returns a QuestEvent object representing the updated quest event state,
    allowing for method chaining and further event processing
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing Quest Objective Progress
    code: 'QuestEvent event = QuestEvent::ObjectiveProgress(playerGuid, 12345, 67890,
      1);

      // Updates the progress of objective 67890 in quest 12345 for player with GUID
      playerGuid by 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Completing a Quest Objective
    code: 'QuestEvent event = QuestEvent::ObjectiveProgress(playerGuid, 12345, 67890,
      5);

      // Sets the progress of objective 67890 in quest 12345 to 5 units for player
      with GUID playerGuid'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when actual progress occurs during gameplay.
    It's important to ensure that the quest and objective identifiers are valid, as
    invalid IDs may result in silent failures or unexpected behavior. The method does
    not directly send updates to the client; it modifies internal state which will
    be synchronized with the player's UI on next update cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method with negative count values may cause progress to decrease
    below zero, potentially leading to unexpected quest states. Always validate that
    objectives are still valid before calling this method. Do not call this method
    outside of proper game context as it may cause synchronization issues or corruption
    of quest data.
