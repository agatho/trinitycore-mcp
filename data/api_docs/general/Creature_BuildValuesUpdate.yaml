documentation:
  brief: Builds and sends creature update packets to target player
  description: This method constructs and sends update packets containing creature
    data to a specific player. It handles the process of building values update for
    creatures, including handling flags and data arrays. The method is typically used
    during creature spawning or when updating creature state information in the game
    world. This function ensures that the target player receives proper updates about
    the creature's current state, including its attributes, health, and other relevant
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing creature data values that
      will be sent to the target player
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags indicating what type of update packet is being constructed
      (e.g., full update, partial update)
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will receive the update packet
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      int data[10] = {0};

      Player* target = new Player();

      creature->BuildValuesUpdate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during creature initialization or when updating
    creature state information. It should be used carefully as it can affect performance
    if called frequently. This method is part of the core update mechanism in TrinityCore
    and requires proper handling of data arrays to ensure correct packet construction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect updates being sent to
    players, potentially causing visual glitches or game state inconsistencies. The
    data array must be properly initialized before calling this method.
