documentation:
  brief: Loads terrain data for a specified grid location in the game world
  description: The LoadMap method is responsible for loading the terrain information
    for a specific grid position within the World of Warcraft instance. This method
    typically handles the retrieval and initialization of height maps, liquid data,
    and other terrain-related information needed for rendering and collision detection.
    It ensures that the specified grid coordinates are properly loaded into memory
    so that game objects can interact with the terrain correctly. The method is usually
    invoked automatically by the core when players or objects move into new grid areas,
    but may also be called manually in specific circumstances such as map loading
    or debugging.
  parameters:
  - name: gx
    description: The X coordinate of the grid position to load (typically in grid
      units, not world coordinates)
  - name: gy
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid position to load (typically in grid
      units, not world coordinates)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for loading a terrain grid
    code: 'TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo();

      terrain->LoadMap(10, 15); // Loads terrain data for grid position (10, 15)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading multiple grids in a loop
    code: "TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo();\nfor (int32 x = 0;\
      \ x < 10; ++x)\n{\n    for (int32 y = 0; y < 10; ++y)\n    {\n        terrain->LoadMap(x,\
      \ y);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    players or objects enter new grid areas. The method may block until the terrain
    data is fully loaded, depending on implementation details. It's important to note
    that grid coordinates are in grid units (typically 533.333 yards per grid), not
    world coordinates.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid grid coordinates may result in undefined
    behavior or memory access violations. Ensure that the grid coordinates are within
    valid map boundaries before calling this method. The method should not be called
    from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
