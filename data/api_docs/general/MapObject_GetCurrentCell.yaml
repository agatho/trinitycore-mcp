documentation:
  brief: Returns the current cell coordinate of the map object.
  description: The GetCurrentCell method retrieves the cell identifier that represents
    the current grid cell position of the MapObject within the game world. In TrinityCore's
    spatial partitioning system, the world is divided into a grid of cells, and each
    object maintains its current cell reference for efficient spatial queries and
    updates. This value is typically used internally by the core systems to manage
    object visibility, update scheduling, and spatial indexing. The returned cell
    coordinate is usually represented as an integer that corresponds to a specific
    grid cell in the map's cell grid system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current cell coordinate
    of the MapObject within the world grid. This value typically corresponds to a
    unique identifier for the grid cell where the object is currently located.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use current cell coordinate
    code: "int currentCell = object->GetCurrentCell();\nif (currentCell >= 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Use the cell coordinate for spatial queries or debugging\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Object is in cell: %d\", currentCell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified. The cell coordinate system typically uses a flat grid layout
    where each cell represents a specific area of the world map. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with other spatial management functions and may be updated
    automatically when an object moves between cells.
