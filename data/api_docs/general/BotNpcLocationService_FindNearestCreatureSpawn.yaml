  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: FindNearestCreatureSpawn
  signature: NpcLocationResult BotNpcLocationService::FindNearestCreatureSpawn(Player
    * bot, uint32 creatureEntry, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Finds the nearest spawn location of a specified creature entry within a given
    range for a bot player.
  description: The FindNearestCreatureSpawn method searches for the closest available
    spawn point of a specified creature type within a defined maximum range from the
    bot's current position. This function is typically used by AI systems to locate
    nearby NPCs for interaction, quest progression, or combat targeting. The method
    evaluates the bot's current zone and surrounding areas to identify valid spawn
    locations that match the given creature entry ID. It returns a NpcLocationResult
    structure containing the coordinates and other relevant information about the
    found spawn point. The search respects the maximum range parameter to avoid excessive
    processing of distant spawns.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is searching
      for the creature spawn location
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature type to search for
      in the database
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which to search for the creature
      spawn location
  returns: Returns a NpcLocationResult structure containing the coordinates and metadata
    of the nearest matching creature spawn, or an invalid result if no suitable spawn
    is found within range
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearest Goblin
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 goblinEntry = 4446;\nfloat maxRange = 50.0f;\n\
      NpcLocationResult result = BotNpcLocationService::FindNearestCreatureSpawn(bot,\
      \ goblinEntry, maxRange);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Use result.GetPosition()\
      \ to get coordinates\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding nearest spawn for quest NPC
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 questGiverEntry = 12345;\nfloat maxRange = 100.0f;\n\
      NpcLocationResult result = BotNpcLocationService::FindNearestCreatureSpawn(bot,\
      \ questGiverEntry, maxRange);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    Position pos = result.GetPosition();\n\
      \    // Move bot to this position\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0,\
      \ pos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs zone-based searching and may cache results for performance
    optimization. It's recommended to use reasonable maxRange values to avoid unnecessary
    computation. The function considers only active spawns that are currently available
    in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the creatureEntry parameter corresponds to a valid NPC entry
    in the database, otherwise the method will return an invalid result. Be cautious
    with very large maxRange values as they may impact performance during high-frequency
    calls.
