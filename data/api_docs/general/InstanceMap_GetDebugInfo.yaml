  signature: std::string InstanceMap::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the instance map including its ID, player
    count, and related instance data.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides a formatted string containing diagnostic
    information about the instance map. This includes the map's unique identifier,
    the number of players currently within the instance, and other relevant instance-related
    metadata. The method is primarily used for debugging purposes during development
    or by administrators to monitor instance states. It does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call from any thread context. The returned string format
    is designed to be human-readable and suitable for logging or display in debug
    consoles.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the instance
    map, including its ID, player count, and instance-specific data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'InstanceMap* instanceMap = ...; // Assume valid instance map pointer

      std::string debugInfo = instanceMap->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Instance debug info: %s", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on instance data and should not
    be used in performance-critical code paths. The returned string is constructed
    each time the method is called, so repeated calls may have minor overhead. It's
    primarily intended for development and debugging scenarios.
