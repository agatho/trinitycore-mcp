  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: GetActionableRecommendations
  signature: int QuestRequirementAnalyzer::GetActionableRecommendations(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes quest requirements and returns actionable recommendations for a
    player to complete a specified quest
  description: The GetActionableRecommendations method evaluates the current state
    of a player's quest progress and determines what actions they can take to advance
    or complete a specific quest. It checks prerequisites, item requirements, NPC
    interactions, and other conditions necessary for quest progression. The method
    returns an integer value representing the number of actionable recommendations
    found, which can be used by the bot or AI system to determine next steps in quest
    completion. This function is typically used in automated questing systems or quest
    recommendation engines within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to analyze for actionable recommendations.
      Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      quest progress is being analyzed. This parameter determines the context of the
      analysis and must not be null.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of actionable recommendations
    found for completing the specified quest. A return value of 0 indicates no recommendations
    were found, while positive values represent the count of available actions that
    can be taken to progress toward quest completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* playerBot = ...; // Valid player pointer\n\
      int recommendations = analyzer.GetActionableRecommendations(questId, playerBot);\n\
      if (recommendations > 0) {\n    // Process the actionable recommendations\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d recommendations for quest %u\\n\", recommendations, questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest completion logic
    code: "uint32 currentQuest = player->GetQuestStatus(12345);\nif (currentQuest\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE) {\n    int actions = analyzer.GetActionableRecommendations(12345,\
      \ player);\n    if (actions > 0) {\n        // Execute the first recommendation\n\
      \        player->SendNotification(\"Executing %d recommended actions for quest.\"\
      , actions);\n    } else {\n        player->SendNotification(\"No actionable\
      \ recommendations found for this quest.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest state, inventory, and location
    to determine relevant recommendations. The implementation may cache results or
    perform database lookups depending on the internal design of QuestRequirementAnalyzer.
    It is recommended to call this method only when necessary as it might involve
    multiple database queries or complex logic evaluation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that
    questId must be a valid quest present in the game's database; otherwise, the method
    may return unexpected results or fail silently.
