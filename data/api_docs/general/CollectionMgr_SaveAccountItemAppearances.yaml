documentation:
  brief: Saves account item appearances to the database using the provided transaction.
  description: The SaveAccountItemAppearances method persists all collected item appearance
    data associated with an account into the database. This function is typically
    invoked during account logout or periodic save operations to ensure that player's
    collected appearances are not lost. It utilizes the provided database transaction
    to maintain data consistency and avoid partial writes. The method operates on
    the current account's item appearance collection, which includes cosmetic variations
    of items that players have obtained through various means such as achievements,
    purchases, or quest rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: An integer representing the database transaction identifier to use
      for saving the data. This parameter ensures that all related database operations
      are grouped within a single transaction for atomicity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetCollectionMgr();

      int transactionId = sWorld->GetDBTransaction();

      collectionMgr->SaveAccountItemAppearances(transactionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database transaction is properly initialized
    and managed by the caller. It's designed to be called within a controlled environment
    where database consistency is critical. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameter; it's expected that trans refers to a valid open transaction.
