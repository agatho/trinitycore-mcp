documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has sufficient gold to afford NPC training
    services.
  description: The CanAffordTraining method checks if the player character currently
    possesses enough gold in their inventory to pay for the cost of training skills
    or spells offered by an NPC. This method is typically used during interaction
    with trainers to validate whether the player can proceed with purchasing training.
    It evaluates the player's current gold amount against the required training cost,
    which may vary depending on the specific skill or spell being trained. The check
    does not modify any game state and is purely a validation function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient gold to pay for the training;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->CanAffordTraining()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ training logic\n    player->TrainSkill(skillId);\n} else {\n    // Notify\
      \ player they cannot afford training\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do\
      \ not have enough gold to train this skill.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the player's gold and the trainer's
    pricing. It assumes that the NPC interaction context has been properly initialized
    with the correct training costs before calling.
