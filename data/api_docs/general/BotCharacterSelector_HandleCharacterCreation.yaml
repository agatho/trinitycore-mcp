  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::HandleCharacterCreation(uint32 accountId,
    const int & request, int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the creation of a new bot character for a specified account.
  description: The HandleCharacterCreation method is responsible for managing the
    process of creating a new bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes
    an account identifier and a request parameter to determine how the character should
    be created, potentially involving database operations, configuration checks, and
    integration with the game's character management system. This method likely serves
    as part of a larger bot management system that allows administrators or automated
    systems to programmatically generate in-game characters for various purposes such
    as testing, automation, or simulation. The callback parameter may be used to notify
    the caller when the creation process is complete.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account that will own the new bot character.
      Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: request
    description: Integer value representing the type or configuration of character
      creation request. The exact meaning depends on implementation but typically
      defines character class, race, or other attributes.
  - name: callback
    description: Integer identifier used to specify a callback function or mechanism
      that will be triggered upon completion of the character creation process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Creation
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      selector.HandleCharacterCreation(12345, 10, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to store new character data
    and may involve thread synchronization if multiple creation requests occur simultaneously.
    It assumes that the account exists and has sufficient permissions or resources
    for creating a bot character.
  warnings: Improper use of the request parameter can lead to invalid character configurations.
    Ensure that accountId corresponds to an actual existing account to avoid database
    errors.
