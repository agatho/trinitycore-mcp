documentation:
  brief: Resets combat timers for the spell's caster, clearing any active combat state
    delays.
  description: The ResetCombatTimers method clears and resets all combat-related timers
    associated with the spell's caster. This typically involves removing any delayed
    or suspended combat states that may have been initiated by previous spell casts
    or combat actions. The method ensures that the caster can immediately resume normal
    combat behavior without waiting for timer-based cooldowns or delays to expire.
    It is commonly used when a spell interrupts or modifies the combat state of the
    caster, such as during defensive spells or abilities that reset combat engagement
    timers.

  examples:
  - title: Resetting Combat Timers After Defensive Spell
    code: "void MyDefensiveSpell::HandleCast()\n{\n    // Cast the defensive spell\n\
      \    Spell::CastSpell(caster, DEFENSIVE_SPELL_ID);\n    \n    // Reset combat\
      \ timers to allow immediate response\n    spell->ResetCombatTimers();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system when certain
    combat state changes occur. It may affect the caster's ability to perform subsequent
    actions immediately, particularly in scenarios involving rapid spell casting or
    defensive maneuvers.
  warnings: Calling this method directly may bypass normal combat flow logic. Ensure
    that resetting combat timers aligns with intended gameplay behavior, especially
    in cases where combat state transitions are critical for game balance.
