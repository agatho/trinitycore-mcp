documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WorldSession object and performs cleanup operations for the associated
    player session.
  description: The WorldSession destructor is automatically invoked when a player's
    session ends, either through logout, disconnect, or server shutdown. It handles
    critical cleanup tasks such as removing the session from active session lists,
    notifying the game world of the session termination, and ensuring that any pending
    operations are properly terminated. This method ensures that resources associated
    with the player session are freed and that the server state remains consistent.
    The destructor is typically not called directly by developers but is part of the
    normal object lifecycle management within TrinityCore's session handling system.

  examples:
  - title: Session destruction during player logout
    code: '// This occurs automatically when a player logs out

      WorldSession* session = sWorld->FindSession(playerGuid);

      // When session goes out of scope or is deleted, ~WorldSession() is called automatically

      // No explicit call needed - handled by the framework'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs essential cleanup operations and should not be overridden
    or called directly. It's part of the automatic memory management system in TrinityCore.
    Developers should understand that session destruction is tied to player logout/disconnect
    events and happens asynchronously.
