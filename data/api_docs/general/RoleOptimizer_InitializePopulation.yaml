documentation:
  brief: Initializes a population for role optimization with specified player count
    and population size
  description: The InitializePopulation method sets up the initial population of role
    assignments for players within the RoleOptimizer system. This method prepares
    the genetic algorithm's starting pool by creating a set number of random role
    configurations based on the provided player count and desired population size.
    It is typically called during the initialization phase of the role optimization
    process before any evolutionary operations begin. The method ensures that each
    individual in the population represents a valid assignment of roles to players,
    adhering to game mechanics constraints such as role availability and player capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: Reference to the number of players in the group for which roles need
      to be optimized. This parameter determines the size of each role assignment
      individual in the population.
  - name: populationSize
    description: The total number of individuals (role assignments) to create in the
      initial population. This controls how many different role configurations are
      generated for the genetic algorithm to work with.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating success or failure of the initialization
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful initialization, while
    negative values may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Population Initialization
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint result = optimizer.InitializePopulation(5,\
      \ 100);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Population initialized successfully\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"Population initialized with 100 individuals for 5 players\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization error\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"Failed to initialize population\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Population for Raid Group
    code: "const int raidSize = 25;\nconst uint32 desiredPopulation = 500;\nRoleOptimizer\
      \ raidOptimizer;\nint initResult = raidOptimizer.InitializePopulation(raidSize,\
      \ desiredPopulation);\nif (initResult == 0) {\n    // Proceed with genetic algorithm\
      \ operations\n    std::cout << \"Raid optimizer population ready for evolution\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Log error and potentially fall back to default\
      \ configuration\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Role optimization failed to initialize\
      \ population for raid of {} players\", raidSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any evolutionary operations such as selection,
    crossover, or mutation. The population size directly impacts performance and convergence
    speed - larger populations provide more diversity but require more computational
    resources. The method assumes that the players parameter refers to a valid group
    size within the game's constraints.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid populationSize (e.g., zero or extremely
    large values) may lead to memory allocation failures or performance issues. Ensure
    that the players parameter represents a realistic number of players for your specific
    use case, as extremely high player counts can cause initialization to fail or
    take excessive time.
