  class: ArenaAI
  method: SignalCCTarget
  signature: void ArenaAI::SignalCCTarget(int * player, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Signals a target for crowd control in arena combat.
  description: The SignalCCTarget method is used by ArenaAI to indicate that a specific
    target has been affected by a crowd control effect. This method likely updates
    internal AI state tracking and may trigger additional behavior such as adjusting
    targeting priority or initiating counter-strategies. The method operates on integer
    pointers representing player and target identifiers, suggesting it's part of a
    low-level combat system interface within the arena AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier who is applying
      the crowd control effect.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier that has
      been affected by the crowd control effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "void ApplyCC()\n{\n    int playerId = 12345;\n    int targetId = 67890;\n\
      \    arenaAI->SignalCCTarget(&playerId, &targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system designed for PvP arena environments.
    It may be called internally by the game engine when crowd control effects are
    applied to units during arena matches.
