documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Blood Death Knight
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff and debuff effects on a Blood Death Knight character. This method
    typically iterates through the character's aura application list, evaluates the
    duration and effects of each active buff or debuff, and updates their visual states
    and gameplay mechanics accordingly. It ensures that the player's combat abilities,
    stat modifiers, and special effects remain properly applied based on their current
    state and any ongoing spell effects. The method is commonly called during combat
    updates, tick intervals, or when new buffs are applied to maintain synchronization
    between the game logic and the character's visual representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    m_bloodDeathKnight->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Buff Management
    code: "void BloodDeathKnightRefactored::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    // Apply custom buff logic\n    if (spellInfo->Id == 50421) // Blood\
      \ Plague\n    {\n        UpdateBuffs(); // Ensure new buff is properly applied\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    accurate buff/debuff states. It may trigger visual updates and gameplay effect
    recalculations, so performance considerations are important for frequent calls.
    The implementation likely uses internal aura tracking systems that are part of
    the TrinityCore core framework.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat or update contexts may
    cause unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that all related buffs are
    properly initialized before calling this method to avoid null reference issues.
