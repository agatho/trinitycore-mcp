  method: GetPriestDefensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetPriestDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for Priest defensive abilities in PvP combat.
  description: 'The GetPriestDefensiveCooldowns method returns the current cooldown
    duration (in milliseconds) for a Priest''s defensive spells while engaged in Player
    vs Player combat. This value is used internally by the PvPCombatAI system to determine
    when a Priest can next use defensive abilities such as Power Word: Shield, Pain
    Suppression, or Divine Protection. The method takes an optional player parameter
    which may be used to specify a particular player instance, though its exact usage
    depends on internal AI logic. This cooldown value is crucial for proper spell
    timing and strategic decision-making in PvP scenarios.'
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player object representing the Priest whose defensive
      cooldowns are being queried. May be null or unused depending on implementation
      details.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the cooldown time in milliseconds
    for Priest defensive abilities. A value of 0 typically indicates that the ability
    is ready to use, while a positive value represents the remaining time until the
    ability becomes available again.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldown = ai->GetPriestDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldown == 0) {\n    // Ability is ready to use\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_POWER_WORD_SHIELD, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategic Decision Making
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldown = ai->GetPriestDefensiveCooldowns(player);\n\
      if (cooldown > 5000) {\n    // Defensive ability not ready for 5+ seconds\n\
      \    // Consider using other abilities or positioning\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DESPERATE_PRAYER, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal PvP AI logic and may be subject to changes
    in future TrinityCore versions. The returned cooldown value reflects the current
    state of the player's defensive abilities and should be checked before attempting
    to cast defensive spells. It is recommended to cache this value if it will be
    used multiple times within a short timeframe.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method without proper null checking may lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. The player parameter must point to a valid Player
    object when used, otherwise the result may be unpredictable. This method should
    only be called during active PvP combat scenarios for accurate results.
