  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: CalculateMovingAverage
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::CalculateMovingAverage(const int & prices, uint32
    window)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the moving average of a given set of prices over a specified window
    size.
  description: The CalculateMovingAverage method computes the arithmetic mean of price
    data points within a sliding window of specified size. This is commonly used in
    market analysis to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term
    trends. The method takes a reference to an array or list of integer prices and
    a window size indicating how many recent values should be considered for the average
    calculation. It returns an integer representing the calculated moving average,
    which may be truncated or rounded depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: prices
    description: A constant reference to an array or list of integers representing
      historical price data points.
  - name: window
    description: A uint32 value specifying the number of recent price points to include
      in the moving average calculation. Must be a positive integer greater than zero.
  returns: An integer representing the calculated moving average of the provided prices
    within the specified window. Returns 0 if the input data is invalid or insufficient
    for the requested window size.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Moving Average Calculation
    code: 'std::vector<int> priceData = {100, 105, 110, 108, 112};

      int avg = marketAnalysis.CalculateMovingAverage(priceData, 3);

      // Result would be the average of last 3 values: (110 + 108 + 112) / 3 = 110'
    language: cpp
  - title: Edge Case with Small Window Size
    code: 'std::vector<int> priceData = {50, 60};

      int avg = marketAnalysis.CalculateMovingAverage(priceData, 5);

      // Since window size exceeds data size, average is calculated over available
      data: (50 + 60) / 2 = 55'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input prices are sorted chronologically from
    oldest to newest. The implementation may truncate or round results based on integer
    division behavior. For performance-critical applications, consider caching previous
    calculations when processing large datasets.
  warnings: Ensure that the window size does not exceed the number of available price
    points; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Be aware that this method operates
    on integer values and may lose precision during average calculation due to truncation.
