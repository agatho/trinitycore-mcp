  signature: QuestEvent QuestEvent::QuestAccepted(int player, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new QuestEvent object representing a player accepting
    a quest.
  description: The QuestAccepted method is a static factory function that constructs
    and initializes a QuestEvent object to represent the event of a player accepting
    a quest in the World of Warcraft game. This method is typically used within the
    TrinityCore server framework to handle quest acceptance logic, track player progress,
    and trigger associated quest-related actions such as updating quest status, granting
    initial quest rewards, or starting quest timers. The returned QuestEvent object
    can then be processed by the event system or passed to other subsystems for further
    handling. This method assumes that the player has valid access to the quest and
    that the quest ID corresponds to a valid quest in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who accepted the quest.
      This should be a valid player GUID from the database.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that was accepted. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  returns: A new QuestEvent object representing the quest acceptance event, initialized
    with the provided player GUID and quest ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Event Creation
    code: 'QuestEvent event = QuestEvent::QuestAccepted(12345, 67890);

      // Creates a quest event for player with GUID 12345 accepting quest 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Quest Event in Quest Handling Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerQuestAccept(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    QuestEvent\
      \ event = QuestEvent::QuestAccepted(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), questId);\n\
      \    // Process the event through the event system\n    sScriptMgr->OnQuestAccept(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's quest event handling system and
    should be used in conjunction with other quest-related APIs. The player parameter
    must reference a valid online player, and the questId must correspond to an existing
    quest in the database. This method does not perform any validation checks on the
    inputs; it simply creates the event object.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the player is actually accepting
    a valid quest. Passing invalid GUIDs or non-existent quest IDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes in the event processing system. Always validate inputs before
    calling this method in production code.
