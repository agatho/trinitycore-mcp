  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetClassSpecStatWeights
  signature: StatWeights LootAnalysis::GetClassSpecStatWeights(uint8 playerClass,
    uint8 playerSpec)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves stat weight values for a specified player class and specialization.
  description: The GetClassSpecStatWeights method returns a StatWeights structure
    containing the relative importance (weights) of various stats for a given player
    class and specialization in World of Warcraft. These weights are used by the loot
    analysis system to determine how beneficial different stat distributions are for
    a specific class/spec combination. The method accesses pre-defined stat weight
    tables that are typically based on simulationcraft or other optimization data
    sources. This information is crucial for players and addons seeking to optimize
    their gear choices based on their character's role and specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The player's class as a uint8 value (Warrior = 1, Paladin = 2, Hunter
      = 3, Rogue = 4, Priest = 5, Death Knight = 6, Shaman = 7, Mage = 8, Warlock
      = 9, Monk = 10, Druid = 11, Demon Hunter = 12).
  - name: playerSpec
    description: 'The player''s specialization ID as a uint8 value. For each class,
      this corresponds to the specific spec (e.g., for Warrior: Arms = 71, Fury =
      72, Protection = 73).'
  returns: A StatWeights structure containing normalized weight values for different
    stats such as Strength, Agility, Intellect, Critical Strike, Haste, Mastery, and
    Versatility. Each stat weight represents the relative value of that stat for the
    specified class/spec combination.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve stat weights for a Warrior (Fury spec)
    code: 'StatWeights weights = lootAnalysis->GetClassSpecStatWeights(1, 72); //
      Class 1 = Warrior, Spec 72 = Fury

      std::cout << "Critical Strike Weight: " << weights.CriticalStrike << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use stat weights to compare gear options
    code: "StatWeights warriorFuryWeights = lootAnalysis->GetClassSpecStatWeights(1,\
      \ 72);\nStatWeights warriorArmsWeights = lootAnalysis->GetClassSpecStatWeights(1,\
      \ 71);\n// Compare how different stats benefit each spec\nif (warriorFuryWeights.Haste\
      \ > warriorArmsWeights.Haste)\n    std::cout << \"Haste is more valuable for\
      \ Fury Warrior\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal stat weight tables that are loaded at
    server startup or dynamically based on game version. The returned StatWeights
    structure may contain default values if no specific weights exist for the given
    class/spec combination. This method is typically used in loot optimization systems
    and addon development.
  warnings: Ensure that playerClass and playerSpec parameters are valid values corresponding
    to actual WoW classes and specs, otherwise the method might return undefined or
    default stat weights. The StatWeights structure returned may have zero or negative
    values for some stats if those stats are not beneficial for the specified class/spec.
