  brief: Sends area spirit healer time information to player
  description: This method sends the remaining time for an area spirit healer to a
    player. It is used in conjunction with spirit healing mechanics where players
    can be healed by spirit healers in specific areas. The method ensures that players
    receive accurate information about how long they have left before their spirit
    healer expires. This method is typically called when a player enters a spirit
    healer area or when the spirit healer time is updated.
  parameters:
  - name: spiritHealerGUID
    description: The GUID of the spirit healer being referenced. This represents the
      unique identifier for the spirit healer object in the game world.
  - name: timeLeft
    description: The time remaining before the spirit healer expires. This value represents
      the seconds left until the spirit healer becomes inactive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int32 timeLeft = 120;

      player->SendAreaSpiritHealerTime(12345, timeLeft);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spirit healer mechanics
    and should be called when a player enters or exits an area where spirit healing
    occurs. The method uses the player's client to send information about the spirit
    healer time remaining.
  warnings: This method should only be called when players are actually in spirit
    healer areas, otherwise it may cause confusion or incorrect information for players.
