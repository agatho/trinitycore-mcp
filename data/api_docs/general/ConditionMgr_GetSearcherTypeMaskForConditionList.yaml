    & conditions) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the searcher type mask required to evaluate a given list of conditions.
  description: The GetSearcherTypeMaskForConditionList method analyzes a container
    of conditions and computes the appropriate searcher type mask needed to properly
    evaluate those conditions. This mask indicates which types of game objects or
    entities (such as players, creatures, game objects, etc.) are relevant for condition
    evaluation. The method is typically used internally by the condition system to
    optimize how conditions are processed during query operations, ensuring that only
    necessary data types are considered when checking whether a set of conditions
    is met. It does not modify any internal state and is purely a utility function
    for condition processing logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the bitmask of searcher types required to evaluate
    the provided list of conditions. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific
    type of entity or object that may be involved in condition evaluation, such as
    players, creatures, game objects, etc., according to predefined constants used
    within TrinityCore's condition system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ConditionContainer conditions;

      // Assume conditions are populated with some conditional entries

      uint32 mask = sConditionMgr->GetSearcherTypeMaskForConditionList(conditions);

      // Use the mask to determine what kind of entities need to be checked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal condition evaluation framework in TrinityCore.
    It helps optimize performance by determining which types of objects must be considered
    during condition checks, avoiding unnecessary processing of irrelevant data types.
    The returned mask should be interpreted using predefined constants defined in
    the condition system.
