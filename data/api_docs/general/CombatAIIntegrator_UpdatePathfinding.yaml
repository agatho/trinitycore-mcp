  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: UpdatePathfinding
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdatePathfinding(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the pathfinding logic for combat AI entities based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdatePathfinding method is responsible for managing and updating
    the pathfinding behavior of AI-controlled units during combat. It processes movement-related
    decisions, recalculates paths when necessary, and ensures that units maintain
    appropriate positioning relative to their targets. This method typically runs
    in the game loop at regular intervals, using the provided time delta (diff) to
    determine how much time has passed since the last update. It integrates with the
    broader CombatAI system to ensure that pathfinding aligns with combat strategies
    such as flanking, maintaining distance, or closing to melee range.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last call to this method.
      Used to determine how much time has passed for pathfinding calculations and
      movement updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_combatAIIntegrator->UpdatePathfinding(diff);\n    // ... continue with\
      \ other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom combat behavior
    code: "void AdvancedCombatAI::UpdateCombatAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_target\
      \ && m_target->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        // Update pathfinding based on time\
      \ delta\n        m_combatAIIntegrator->UpdatePathfinding(diff);\n        \n\
      \        // Perform additional combat actions\n        HandleCombatMovement();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within an AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly outside of that context. It relies on the internal state
    of the CombatAIIntegrator to determine whether pathfinding updates are necessary,
    which may depend on factors such as target movement, unit positioning, or combat
    phase. The diff parameter is critical for ensuring smooth and accurate timing
    of pathfinding recalculations.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method manually unless you understand its internal
    dependencies and state management. Incorrect use of the diff parameter can lead
    to erratic pathfinding behavior or performance issues. This method assumes that
    the AI unit's target and environment are valid, so calling it on invalid targets
    may result in undefined behavior.
