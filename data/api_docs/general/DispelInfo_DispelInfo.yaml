  class: DispelInfo
  method: DispelInfo
  signature: void DispelInfo::DispelInfo(int * dispeller, uint32 dispellerSpellId,
    uint8 chargesRemoved)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DispelInfo object with dispeller data, spell ID, and charges
    removed.
  description: The DispelInfo constructor initializes internal state with information
    about a dispel event. It stores the pointer to the dispeller, the spell ID responsible
    for the dispel, and the number of charges that were removed from the affected
    aura. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to track
    and manage dispel events in combat mechanics. The dispeller parameter usually
    points to a GameObject or Unit that initiated the dispel, while dispellerSpellId
    identifies the specific spell causing the dispel effect. ChargesRemoved indicates
    how many charges were consumed during the dispel operation.
  parameters:
  - name: dispeller
    description: Pointer to the object (Unit or GameObject) that performed the dispel.
      Can be NULL if no valid dispeller exists.
  - name: dispellerSpellId
    description: The Spell ID of the spell that caused the dispel effect. Used for
      tracking and logging purposes.
  - name: chargesRemoved
    description: Number of charges removed from the aura during the dispel operation.
      Typically 1 for most dispels, but can be higher in special cases.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DispelInfo Initialization
    code: 'Unit* caster = ...;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      uint8 charges = 1;

      DispelInfo info(caster, spellId, charges);'
    language: cpp
  - title: DispelInfo with Null Dispellers
    code: 'GameObject* go = nullptr;

      uint32 spellId = 67890;

      uint8 charges = 3;

      DispelInfo info(go, spellId, charges);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the DispelInfo class which is used internally
    by TrinityCore's aura system. The dispeller pointer should be validated before
    use as it may be NULL in certain scenarios such as environmental or scripted dispels.
    The chargesRemoved parameter directly affects how many charges are decremented
    from an aura's stack count.
  warnings: Be cautious when passing NULL pointers for the dispeller parameter, as
    this may lead to undefined behavior if not properly handled by downstream code.
    Ensure that dispellerSpellId corresponds to a valid spell entry in the database
    to avoid incorrect tracking of dispel events.
