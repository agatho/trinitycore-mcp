  signature: void ChatPacketSender::operator()(const Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat packet to the specified player.
  description: The ChatPacketSender::operator() method is a function call operator
    that delivers a preformatted chat message packet to a specific player in the game
    world. This method is typically used within the context of TrinityCore's packet
    handling system to broadcast or send private messages, system notifications, or
    other chat-related communications. The method operates on a const Player pointer
    and does not return any value. It is designed to be invoked as part of a functor
    pattern, where the ChatPacketSender object itself acts as a callable entity that
    processes and sends chat data to the target player.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A constant pointer to the Player object representing the recipient
      of the chat packet. This parameter must not be null; attempting to use a null
      pointer will result in undefined behavior or a crash.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ChatPacketSender functor
    code: 'ChatPacketSender sender;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Obtain player reference

      sender(targetPlayer); // Sends chat packet to target player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal messaging infrastructure and
    should only be used when proper packet construction has already occurred. The
    actual packet data is likely pre-built within the ChatPacketSender instance before
    calling this operator.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. This method assumes
    that all necessary packet preparation steps have been completed prior to invocation.
