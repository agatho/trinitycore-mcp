  class: MonkAI
  method: CastRoll
  signature: void MonkAI::CastRoll(int targetPos)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a roll action for the Monk AI at the specified target position.
  description: The CastRoll method in the MonkAI class is responsible for executing
    a rolling animation or mechanic specific to the monk class. This method likely
    triggers a combat-related ability such as Roll, which is a defensive maneuver
    that can provide immunity to certain effects or reduce incoming damage. The targetPos
    parameter determines where the roll will be executed relative to the current position
    of the AI-controlled monk. This function is typically called during combat situations
    when the monk needs to perform evasive maneuvers or utilize its special abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPos
    description: An integer value representing the target position for the roll action.
      This parameter likely defines the direction or relative location where the monk
      will execute the roll, such as forward, backward, left, or right from their
      current facing direction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Roll Execution
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = static_cast<MonkAI*>(unit->GetAI());

      ai->CastRoll(1); // Execute roll towards position 1 (e.g., forward)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Roll Based on Health
    code: "if (unit->GetHealthPct() < 30)\n{\n    MonkAI* ai = static_cast<MonkAI*>(unit->GetAI());\n\
      \    ai->CastRoll(2); // Execute roll towards position 2 (e.g., backward)\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework that handles class-specific
    abilities for the monk. The targetPos parameter may have predefined values or
    ranges that correspond to specific directional movements. Implementation details
    might include cooldown checks, line-of-sight validation, and interaction with
    the game's combat system.
  warnings: The method assumes proper initialization of the MonkAI context and should
    not be called on units without a valid AI component. Incorrect targetPos values
    may result in undefined behavior or failed execution of the roll action.
