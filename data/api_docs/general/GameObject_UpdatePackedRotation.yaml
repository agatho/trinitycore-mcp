  class: GameObject
  method: UpdatePackedRotation
  signature: void GameObject::UpdatePackedRotation()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the packed rotation values for the GameObject based on its current
    orientation.
  description: This method updates the packed rotation data for a GameObject, which
    is used to store and transmit the object's orientation in a compact format. The
    packed rotation typically represents the yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the object
    in a compressed form that can be efficiently transmitted over the network or stored
    in memory. This method is essential for maintaining synchronization between client
    and server when the GameObject's orientation changes, particularly during movement
    or rotation events.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* gameObject = new GameObject();

      gameObject->UpdatePackedRotation();

      // This updates the packed rotation values for the GameObject'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during movement updates or when
    orientation changes occur. It may involve calculations to convert Euler angles
    into a packed format, and performance considerations should be taken into account
    when used frequently.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's usually
    invoked automatically by the game engine during movement or rotation events. Calling
    this manually could result in inconsistent orientation data if not handled properly.
