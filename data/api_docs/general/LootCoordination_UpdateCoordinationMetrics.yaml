  class: LootCoordination
  method: UpdateCoordinationMetrics
  signature: void LootCoordination::UpdateCoordinationMetrics(uint32 groupId, const
    LootSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Updates loot coordination metrics for a specified group within a loot session.
  description: The UpdateCoordinationMetrics method is responsible for maintaining
    and updating internal tracking metrics related to loot distribution coordination.
    It processes data from a given loot session and applies it to the coordination
    system, likely for statistical purposes or to manage loot priority and fairness
    among group members. This method ensures that the loot coordination system accurately
    reflects the current state of loot decisions made during a specific session. The
    method operates on a per-group basis, allowing different groups within the same
    session to be tracked independently. It is typically invoked when loot decisions
    are finalized or when significant changes occur in the coordination process.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group for which metrics should be updated.
      This value determines which specific group's coordination data will be modified.
  - name: session
    description: A reference to the LootSession object containing the current loot
      distribution data and state information. This parameter provides all necessary
      context for updating the coordination metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      LootSession session;

      coordination.UpdateCoordinationMetrics(groupId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Group and Session Initialization
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      LootSession session;

      // Initialize session with loot data

      session.AddLootItem(1001, 1);

      session.SetLootMethod(LOOT_METHOD_MASTER); // Example method

      coordination.UpdateCoordinationMetrics(groupId, session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the loot coordination system to
    maintain accurate statistics and ensure fair distribution of loot items. It may
    be called automatically during loot processing or manually when specific coordination
    events occur. The method assumes that the provided session data is valid and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId parameter corresponds to a valid group in the
    current context, as invalid group IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    metric updates. The session parameter must be fully initialized with accurate
    loot data for meaningful metrics to be generated.
