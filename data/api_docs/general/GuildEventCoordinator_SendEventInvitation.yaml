documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event invitation to a specified player.
  description: The SendEventInvitation method is responsible for dispatching an invitation
    message to a player regarding a specific guild event. This method facilitates
    communication between the guild event coordinator and players, ensuring that members
    are notified about upcoming events. It typically involves checking if the player
    is part of the guild, verifying the event exists, and then sending an appropriate
    in-game notification or message to the target player. The method does not return
    any value but triggers internal game systems to handle the invitation process.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will receive the event
      invitation. This must correspond to a valid online or offline player within
      the game world.
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event for which the invitation
      is being sent. This ID should reference an existing event in the guild's event
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SendEventInvitation(123456, 7890);

      // Sends an invitation for event ID 7890 to player with GUID 123456.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's client to display a notification
    or popup related to the guild event. It may also update internal state tracking
    whether the player has been invited. Ensure that both playerGuid and eventId are
    valid before calling this method.
