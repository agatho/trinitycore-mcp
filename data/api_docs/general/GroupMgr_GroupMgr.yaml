documentation:
  brief: Moves a GroupMgr object to another GroupMgr instance using move semantics.
  description: The GroupMgr move constructor transfers ownership of resources from
    one GroupMgr instance to another. This operation is typically used when assigning
    or returning GroupMgr objects to avoid unnecessary copying. The source GroupMgr
    becomes invalid after the move and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's
    group management system, this constructor facilitates efficient resource handling
    for group-related operations without duplicating internal data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another GroupMgr instance whose resources
      will be moved to this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move GroupMgr Instance
    code: 'GroupMgr sourceGroupMgr;

      // ... perform operations on sourceGroupMgr ...

      GroupMgr newGroupMgr = std::move(sourceGroupMgr); // Move constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, so it's designed for efficient resource transfer.
    After moving, the original object should not be accessed as its state becomes
    undefined. This pattern is common in modern C++ for optimizing performance when
    dealing with complex objects like group managers.
  warnings: Using the moved-from GroupMgr instance after calling this constructor
    results in undefined behavior. Ensure that no further operations are performed
    on the source object post-move.
