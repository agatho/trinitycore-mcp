  class: GarrisonMap
  method: GetGarrison
  signature: Garrison * GarrisonMap::GetGarrison()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Garrison object associated with the current GarrisonMap instance.
  description: The GetGarrison method returns a pointer to the Garrison object that
    is linked to the current GarrisonMap. This method is typically used within the
    context of World of Warcraft's garrison system, where each map may represent a
    specific garrison layout or area. The returned pointer can be used to access various
    garrison-related properties and functionalities such as building placement, follower
    management, and resource tracking. It is important to note that this method assumes
    the GarrisonMap has been properly initialized with a valid garrison reference,
    otherwise it may return a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Garrison object associated with this GarrisonMap. Returns
    nullptr if no garrison is linked to the map or if the map has not been properly
    initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Garrison* garrison = garrisonMap->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the garrison object\n    uint32 garrisonId = garrison->GetID();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Garrison Before Usage
    code: "Garrison* garrison = garrisonMap->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison != nullptr\
      \ && garrison->IsInitialized())\n{\n    // Safe to use the garrison\n    std::vector<Follower*>\
      \ followers = garrison->GetFollowers();\n    // Process followers...\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where garrison is not valid\n    sLog->outError(\"Garrison\
      \ not initialized for map.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the returned Garrison object
    beyond ensuring it's not null. Developers should verify that the garrison is properly
    initialized before using its methods. The method is likely implemented as a simple
    getter and should have minimal performance impact.
  warnings: Always check if the returned pointer is not null before dereferencing
    it. Accessing members of a null garrison pointer will result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method might return null in scenarios where the map does not
    correspond to an active garrison, such as during map loading or initialization
    phases.
