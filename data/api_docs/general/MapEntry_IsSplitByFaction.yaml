  signature: bool MapEntry::IsSplitByFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map is split by faction, meaning different factions
    have separate instances or areas.
  description: The IsSplitByFaction method checks if a map entry represents a world
    map that is divided by faction. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft to
    determine if players from opposing factions (Alliance and Horde) are separated
    into distinct areas or instances on the same map. For example, certain battlegrounds
    or zones may be split so that each faction has its own version of the area. This
    method returns true when the map is configured to be faction-specific, allowing
    for proper handling of faction-based content and player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is split by faction, indicating that different
    factions have separate instances or areas within the same map; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry is Split by Faction
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(1234); // Example map ID\nif (entry->IsSplitByFaction())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"This map is split by faction.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      This map is not split by faction.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during map initialization and player zone handling
    to ensure that faction-specific content is correctly loaded or displayed for each
    side.
