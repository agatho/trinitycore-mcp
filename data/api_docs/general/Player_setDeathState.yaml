api:
  class: Player
  method: setDeathState
  signature: void Player::setDeathState(int s)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the death state of the player to specified status.
  description: This method controls the player's death state by setting it to a specific
    value. The parameter 's' determines whether the player is alive (0) or dead (1).
    When set to 1, the player will be marked as dead and will not be able to perform
    actions that require being alive. This method is typically used during game mechanics
    such as death handling, resurrection logic, or when transitioning between states
    in the game loop.
  parameters:
  - name: s
    description: The death state value; 0 indicates alive, 1 indicates dead.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->setDeathState(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = new Player();\nif (player->getDeathState() == 0)\n{\n\
      \    player->setDeathState(1);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle resurrection logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core player state management system and should
    be used carefully to avoid unintended consequences in game progression. It affects
    the player's ability to perform actions and can influence game mechanics related
    to death and resurrection.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior during gameplay,
    such as players being unable to perform actions when they should be able to. Always
    ensure that the state is properly set before proceeding with game logic involving
    death or resurrection.
