documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of bank slots available to the player
  description: The GetBankSlotCount method retrieves the total number of bank slots
    that are currently accessible to a player character. This value represents the
    sum of default bank slots plus any additional slots purchased through bank slot
    upgrades. The method is typically used by the EconomyManager class to manage and
    query banking capabilities for players within the TrinityCore framework. It provides
    a read-only view of the player's bank inventory capacity and does not modify any
    internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of available bank slots for
    the player. This includes both default slots and any purchased upgrades.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 slotCount = economyManager.GetBankSlotCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_PLAYER, "Player has %u bank slots available.", slotCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bank Slot Availability for Upgrade
    code: "EconomyManager* econMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();\nuint32 currentSlots\
      \ = econMgr->GetBankSlotCount();\nif (currentSlots < MAX_BANK_SLOTS)\n{\n  \
      \  // Player can purchase more bank slots\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_PLAYER,\
      \ \"Player can upgrade bank slots from %u to %u\", currentSlots, currentSlots\
      \ + 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not perform any database operations during
    execution. It returns cached values that are updated when the player purchases
    additional bank slots or logs in. The returned value reflects the player's current
    banking capacity at the time of the call.
  warnings: The returned slot count may not reflect real-time changes if the player
    has recently purchased new slots but the update hasn't been processed yet. Always
    verify that the value is up-to-date before making decisions based on it in critical
    gameplay scenarios.
