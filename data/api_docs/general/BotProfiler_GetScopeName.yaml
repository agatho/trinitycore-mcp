  signature: std::string BotProfiler::GetScopeName(ProfilingScope scope) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the string name of a given profiling scope identifier
  description: The GetScopeName method translates a ProfilingScope enumeration value
    into its corresponding human-readable string representation. This is typically
    used for logging, debugging, or displaying profiling information in a user-friendly
    format. The method is part of the BotProfiler class which manages performance
    profiling for AI bots within the TrinityCore framework. It allows developers to
    associate meaningful names with profiling scopes for better analysis and monitoring
    of bot behavior and performance metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the human-readable name of the specified profiling
    scope. Returns an empty string if the scope value is invalid or unrecognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingScope scope = ProfilingScope::BOT_THINKING;

      std::string scopeName = profiler.GetScopeName(scope);

      // scopeName would contain "Bot Thinking" or similar descriptive string'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Profiling Scopes
    code: "void LogProfilingStart(BotProfiler& profiler, ProfilingScope scope) {\n\
      \    std::string scopeName = profiler.GetScopeName(scope);\n    if (!scopeName.empty())\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Starting profiling for: %s\", scopeName.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal mapping table or switch statement to
    convert enumeration values to strings. The implementation should be efficient
    as it may be called frequently during profiling operations. The method is marked
    as const, indicating it does not modify the BotProfiler instance state.
  warnings: Ensure that the ProfilingScope enum values passed to this method are valid
    and defined within the current build of TrinityCore. Invalid scope values may
    return empty strings which could lead to silent failures if not properly checked.
