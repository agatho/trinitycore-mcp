documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ProfessionAuctionBridge instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ProfessionAuctionBridge class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of ProfessionAuctionBridge goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's auction house system, this may involve releasing
    references to auction items, clearing internal data structures, or notifying other
    subsystems about the destruction of the bridge. The destructor is automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime and should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ProfessionAuctionBridge instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge = new ProfessionAuctionBridge();\n\
      \    // ... use the bridge ...\n    delete bridge; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be virtual if this class is intended to be inherited
    from, to ensure proper cleanup of derived classes. Since this is a destructor,
    it's important that no exceptions are thrown during its execution as it may lead
    to undefined behavior.
