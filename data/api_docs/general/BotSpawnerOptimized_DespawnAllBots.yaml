documentation:
  brief: Despawns all active bot creatures managed by the BotSpawnerOptimized instance.
  description: The DespawnAllBots method is responsible for removing all currently
    spawned bot creatures from the game world. This function iterates through the
    collection of bots managed by the BotSpawnerOptimized class and triggers their
    removal process, ensuring they are properly cleaned up from the server environment.
    The method does not return any value and is typically used when shutting down
    bot systems, resetting bot configurations, or cleaning up after testing scenarios.
    It assumes that all bots have been properly initialized and spawned before calling
    this method.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      spawner.DespawnAllBots();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Cleanup Routine
    code: "void CleanupBotSystem()\n{\n    BotSpawnerOptimized* botSpawner = GetBotSpawner();\n\
      \    if (botSpawner)\n    {\n        botSpawner->DespawnAllBots();\n       \
      \ // Additional cleanup logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through internal bot tracking structures and
    calls individual despawn functions for each bot. It may also handle cleanup of
    associated AI components or data structures. Performance could be impacted if
    a large number of bots are active simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are in combat or performing critical actions
    might result in unexpected behavior or data loss. Ensure all bot operations are
    safely terminated before invoking this function.
