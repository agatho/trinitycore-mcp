api:
  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GenerateSessionId
  signature: uint32 FarmingCoordinator::GenerateSessionId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique session identifier for farming operations within the coordinator.
  description: The GenerateSessionId method creates and returns a unique 32-bit unsigned
    integer identifier that represents a specific farming session. This identifier
    is used internally by the FarmingCoordinator to track and manage individual farming
    activities, ensuring proper state management and data isolation between different
    farming operations. The generated ID is typically used as a key in internal maps
    or databases to associate player actions, crop growth states, and resource tracking
    with a particular session. The method does not require any input parameters and
    will always return a valid unique identifier upon invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32) representing the newly generated
    session ID. Each call to this method produces a distinct value, ensuring no two
    active sessions share the same identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session ID Generation
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 sessionId = coordinator.GenerateSessionId();

      // sessionId now contains a unique identifier for this farming session'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Session ID in Farming Context
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator* farmCoord = new FarmingCoordinator();

      uint32 sessionId = farmCoord->GenerateSessionId();

      // Use sessionId to initialize farming session data

      std::cout << "New farming session started with ID: " << sessionId << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a new farming operation begins, such
    as when a player starts tending to crops or initiating a new farming activity.
    The implementation likely uses an internal counter or random number generator
    to ensure uniqueness of IDs across concurrent sessions.
