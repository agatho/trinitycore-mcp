  class: ProfessionManager
  method: HandleCraftingResult
  signature: void ProfessionManager::HandleCraftingResult(int * player, const RecipeInfo
    & recipe, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the result of a crafting attempt, updating player progress and
    inventory based on success or failure.
  description: The HandleCraftingResult method is responsible for managing the outcome
    of a player's crafting action within the TrinityCore framework. It takes into
    account whether the crafting was successful or not and updates relevant game state
    accordingly, such as modifying item counts, skill levels, and potentially awarding
    crafted items to the player's inventory. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining
    the integrity of the crafting system by ensuring that all side effects of crafting
    are properly handled. The method operates on a player reference, a recipe definition,
    and a boolean indicating success status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Used to identify which player performed the crafting action.
  - name: recipe
    description: Reference to a RecipeInfo structure containing details about the
      recipe that was attempted, including required materials, skill requirements,
      and output items.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the crafting attempt succeeded (true)
      or failed (false). Determines how the method processes the outcome.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Crafting Result Handling
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      RecipeInfo recipe;

      // Assume recipe is populated with valid data

      ProfessionManager manager;

      manager.HandleCraftingResult(&playerId, recipe, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Failed Crafting Attempt
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      RecipeInfo recipe;

      // Assume recipe is populated with valid data

      ProfessionManager manager;

      manager.HandleCraftingResult(&playerId, recipe, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database operations to persist changes
    in player progress and inventory. It may also trigger UI updates or notifications
    to the client upon completion. Developers should ensure that the RecipeInfo parameter
    is properly initialized before calling this function.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the success flag can lead to inconsistent game state,
    such as awarding items when crafting fails or failing to deduct materials on successful
    crafts. Always validate the player ID and recipe data before invoking this method.
