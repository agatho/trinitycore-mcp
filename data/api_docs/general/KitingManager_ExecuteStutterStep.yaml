  class: KitingManager
  method: ExecuteStutterStep
  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::ExecuteStutterStep(const KitingContext &
    context)
documentation:
  brief: Performs a stutter step kiting maneuver to evade incoming attacks or reposition
    the player.
  description: The ExecuteStutterStep method implements a kiting technique used in
    World of Warcraft combat to maintain distance from enemies while minimizing damage
    taken. This method analyzes the current kiting context, including player position,
    target location, and threat levels, then executes a calculated movement pattern
    that involves brief backward or sidestep movements followed by quick forward advances.
    The maneuver is designed to disrupt enemy attack timing and create opportunities
    for safe positioning. The method requires a valid KitingContext to be provided
    and returns a KitingResult indicating success or failure of the maneuver.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a KitingResult enum value indicating whether the stutter step was
    successful, failed due to invalid conditions, or encountered an error during execution.
    Possible values may include KITING_SUCCESS, KITING_FAILED_INVALID_CONTEXT, or
    KITING_FAILED_MOVEMENT_CONSTRAINTS.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteStutterStep
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// Initialize context with player and target data\n\
      KitingResult result = kitingManager.ExecuteStutterStep(context);\nif (result\
      \ == KITING_SUCCESS) {\n    // Stutter step executed successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Stutter step completed successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n    printf(\"Stutter step failed with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the advanced kiting AI system and should only be called
    when the player is under threat or in combat situations. The method may perform
    multiple internal checks to ensure the movement is valid within game physics constraints.
    It's recommended to call this method from within a combat state handler to maintain
    proper timing and positioning.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteStutterStep outside of combat or with an invalid KitingContext
    can result in undefined behavior or failed execution. The method may not work
    properly if the player is in an environment with movement restrictions such as
    being stuck in terrain or obstructed by objects.
