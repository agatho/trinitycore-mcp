documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to follow the hunter.
  description: The CommandPetFollow method instructs the hunter's summoned pet to
    return to and follow the hunter's position. This method is typically invoked when
    the hunter issues a 'follow' command through the user interface or game mechanics,
    causing the pet to move to the hunter's location and maintain proximity. The behavior
    aligns with standard Hunter pet AI logic in World of Warcraft, where pets can
    be commanded to follow, stay, or attack. This method does not directly control
    movement but rather triggers the appropriate AI state change within the pet's
    behavior system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Hunter AI context
    code: "void MyHunterAI::HandlePlayerCommand()\n{\n    CommandPetFollow();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Hunter's AI system and relies on the pet's current
    state and the hunter's command interface. It assumes that a pet is already summoned
    and under the hunter's control.
