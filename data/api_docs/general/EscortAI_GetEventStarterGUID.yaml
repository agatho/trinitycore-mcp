  class: EscortAI
  method: GetEventStarterGUID
  signature: int EscortAI::GetEventStarterGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the player who initiated the escort event.
  description: The GetEventStarterGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the player who started the current escort quest or event. This method is typically
    used within the EscortAI system to track which player triggered the escort behavior,
    allowing for proper quest tracking, reward distribution, and event management.
    The returned GUID can be used to identify the specific player object in the game
    world for further interaction or validation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the player who started the escort
    event. If no event starter has been set, this method may return 0 or a default
    invalid GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Event Starter
    code: "void MyEscortAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (GetEventStarterGUID()\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Perform actions based on the event starter\n    \
      \    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(GetEventStarterGUID());\n \
      \       if (player)\n        {\n            // Send quest update or other player-specific\
      \ actions\n            player->SendUpdateWorldState(1234, 1);\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EscortAI system and should only be called when
    an escort event is active. The GUID returned represents a player object in the
    game world and can be used with ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer() to retrieve the actual
    Player object for further processing.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active escort event may return invalid
    or unexpected values. Ensure that the escort AI has been properly initialized
    and that an event starter has been set before calling this method.
