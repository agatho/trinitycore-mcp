  class: GameObject
  method: SetWorldEffectID
  signature: void GameObject::SetWorldEffectID(uint32 worldEffectID)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the world effect ID for the game object, controlling visual effects
    and animations.
  description: This method assigns a specific world effect ID to a GameObject instance,
    which determines the visual behavior and animation sequence that will be displayed
    when the object is interacted with or activated. The world effect ID controls
    how the object appears in the game world, including its visual effects, animations,
    and associated data. This method is typically used during object initialization
    or when modifying an object's behavior dynamically. The value should correspond
    to a valid WorldEffect entry in the database, and setting it incorrectly may result
    in missing or incorrect visual effects.
  parameters:
  - name: worldEffectID
    description: The unique identifier for the world effect to be applied to this
      GameObject. This ID must reference a valid WorldEffect entry in the database,
      typically ranging from 0 to several thousand depending on the game version and
      object type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetWorldEffectID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Object Initialization
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      uint32 worldEffectID = 54321;

      go->SetWorldEffectID(worldEffectID);

      // This would be used during object creation or when setting up special effects

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during object initialization or when modifying
    the object's behavior dynamically. It is important to ensure that the worldEffectID
    corresponds to valid entries in the database, as invalid IDs may cause visual
    glitches or missing effects. The method is thread-safe and does not require synchronization.
  warnings: Setting an invalid worldEffectID can lead to visual artifacts or missing
    animations. Care should be taken to validate the ID against database entries before
    calling this method. Incorrect usage may result in objects appearing without proper
    visual effects.
