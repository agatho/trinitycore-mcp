  class: DependencyValidator
  method: GetMySQLVersion
  signature: std::string DependencyValidator::GetMySQLVersion()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the version string of the MySQL database used by the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The GetMySQLVersion method queries the connected MySQL database instance
    to retrieve its version information. This is typically used during server startup
    or dependency validation to ensure compatibility with required MySQL versions.
    The returned string contains detailed version information including major, minor,
    and patch numbers along with any additional build identifiers. This method is
    essential for maintaining database compatibility and can be used in diagnostic
    logging or automated system checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the MySQL version information in a format such
    as '8.0.33' or '5.7.42-log'. Returns an empty string if the database connection
    is unavailable or if version retrieval fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Version Check
    code: "DependencyValidator validator;\nstd::string version = validator.GetMySQLVersion();\n\
      if (!version.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"MySQL Version: \" << version <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to retrieve MySQL version\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Version Validation in Startup Routine
    code: "DependencyValidator validator;\nstd::string version = validator.GetMySQLVersion();\n\
      if (version.find(\"8.0\") == 0) {\n    // Proceed with MySQL 8.0 specific features\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Compatible MySQL 8.0 detected\" << std::endl;\n} else if\
      \ (version.find(\"5.7\") == 0) {\n    // Handle MySQL 5.7 compatibility\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"MySQL 5.7 compatibility mode enabled\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cerr << \"Unsupported MySQL version: \" << version << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires an active database connection to function properly.
    The implementation likely uses a SQL query such as 'SELECT VERSION()' internally.
    Performance impact is minimal since it's a single database query executed once
    during initialization.
  warnings: If the database connection fails or is not established before calling
    this method, it may return an empty string. Always check for empty returns in
    production code to avoid assuming version compatibility.
