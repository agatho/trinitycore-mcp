  signature: bool Loot::HasAllowedLooter(const int & looter) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific looter is allowed to receive loot from this loot instance.
  description: The HasAllowedLooter method determines whether a given player, identified
    by their unique identifier (GUID), is permitted to receive items from the current
    loot object. This method evaluates the loot rules and permissions set for the
    specific loot instance, such as group loot rules, personal loot settings, or quest-related
    loot restrictions. It is commonly used during loot distribution to ensure that
    only eligible players can claim items. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is typically called before attempting to award loot to a player.
  parameters:
  - name: looter
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is being checked for
      loot eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the specified looter is allowed to receive loot from this
    instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player can loot an item
    code: "if (loot->HasAllowedLooter(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is allowed to\
      \ loot\n    loot->AddItem(itemId, itemCount);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ loot\n    SendLootError(player, LOOT_ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal loot rules and permissions stored within
    the Loot object. It may consider group membership, loot mode settings, and individual
    player permissions. The GUID passed should be a valid player identifier.
