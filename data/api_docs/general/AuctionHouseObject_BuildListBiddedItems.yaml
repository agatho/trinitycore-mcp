    & listBiddedItemsResult, const Player * player, uint32 offset, int sorts) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates an auction list bidded items result packet with data for a specific
    player.
  description: The BuildListBiddedItems method constructs and fills a WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionListBiddedItemsResult
    packet with information about items the specified player has placed bids on. This
    method is typically invoked when a player opens their auction house interface
    to view their bid history. It filters and formats auction data based on the player's
    bids, including item details, bid amounts, and auction durations. The method respects
    pagination through the offset parameter and applies sorting based on the sorts
    parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: listBiddedItemsResult
    description: Reference to the AuctionListBiddedItemsResult packet that will be
      populated with auction data for items the player has bid on.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose bidded items are being retrieved.
      Must not be null.
  - name: offset
    description: The starting index for pagination of auction results. Used to retrieve
      a subset of bidded items.
  - name: sorts
    description: Sorting criteria for the auction items, typically represented as
      bit flags or integer values indicating sort order.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionListBiddedItemsResult result;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      uint32 offset = 0;

      int sorts = 0;


      auctionHouseObject->BuildListBiddedItems(result, player, offset, sorts);

      player->SendDirectMessage(result);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the auction house data is already loaded and accessible.
    It may perform database queries or internal lookups to gather bid information
    for the specified player. The method does not handle error conditions directly
    but relies on the packet system to manage transmission errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The offset and sorts
    parameters should be validated to prevent out-of-bounds access or incorrect sorting
    behavior.
