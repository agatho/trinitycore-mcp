documentation:
  brief: Selects a quest reward for the specified player and quest ID.
  description: The SelectQuestReward method is responsible for choosing a reward from
    a list of available rewards for a given quest. This method typically gets invoked
    when a player completes a quest and needs to select which reward they wish to
    receive. It interacts with the quest system to ensure that the selected reward
    is properly processed and awarded to the player. The method operates within the
    context of the TrinityCore framework, managing quest state transitions and reward
    distribution logic.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player who is
      selecting a quest reward.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the reward is being selected.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Selection
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestPickup::SelectQuestReward(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has completed the specified quest and
    that the quest rewards are available for selection. It may internally call other
    methods to validate quest completion and reward eligibility.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID provided is valid and corresponds to a completed
    quest; otherwise, the behavior of this method may be undefined or result in an
    error.
