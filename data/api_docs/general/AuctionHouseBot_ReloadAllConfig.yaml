  brief: Reloads all configuration settings for the Auction House Bot system
  description: The ReloadAllConfig method refreshes all configuration parameters used
    by the AuctionHouseBot class. This function typically reads updated settings from
    the database or configuration files and applies them to the active bot instance.
    It ensures that any changes made to auction house bot behavior, pricing strategies,
    item filters, or other operational parameters are immediately reflected in the
    running system without requiring a server restart. The method is commonly invoked
    when administrators need to adjust bot behavior dynamically during server operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may temporarily disrupt ongoing
    auction activities. It's recommended to execute this during low-traffic periods
    or when the auction house is not actively processing transactions.
  warnings: Calling this method while the auction house bot is actively managing auctions
    may cause temporary inconsistencies in pricing or item listings. Always ensure
    that configuration changes are properly validated before reloading.
