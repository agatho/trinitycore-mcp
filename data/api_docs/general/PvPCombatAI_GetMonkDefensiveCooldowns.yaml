documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for defensive monk abilities in PvP combat.
  description: The GetMonkDefensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the remaining
    cooldown duration for a monk's defensive abilities when engaged in Player versus
    Player (PvP) combat. This method is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to
    determine when a monk can next use defensive skills such as Fortifying Brew, Diffuse
    Magic, or other similar abilities. The returned value represents the time in milliseconds
    until the next available defensive cooldown.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cooldown time in milliseconds for the monk's
    defensive abilities. A return value of 0 indicates that the defensive cooldowns
    are currently available and can be used immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldown = ai->GetMonkDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldown == 0) {\n    // Defensive abilities are available\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 120954, true); // Fortifying Brew\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI system and should only be called from
    within the context of PvP combat. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific monk class specialization (Mistweaver, Windwalker, etc.) and current
    game state.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only invoked during active PvP encounters to
    avoid incorrect cooldown calculations. Calling this method outside of PvP combat
    may result in undefined behavior or inaccurate cooldown timing.
