  class: CreatureGroup
  method: FormationReset
  signature: void CreatureGroup::FormationReset(bool dismiss)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the creature group's formation to its default state, optionally dismissing
    the group.
  description: The FormationReset method is used to reset a creature group's formation
    behavior back to its initial state. This method can optionally dismiss the group,
    which removes all creatures from their current formation and returns them to their
    default AI behavior. The reset operation ensures that any temporary or custom
    formation settings are cleared, restoring the group to how it was originally defined
    in the database or script. This is commonly used when a creature group needs to
    be reinitialized after completing a specific task or when transitioning between
    different combat phases.
  parameters:
  - name: dismiss
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to dismiss the creature group.
      If true, all creatures in the group will be removed from their formation and
      return to default AI behavior. If false, only the formation settings are reset
      without dismissing the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Formation Without Dismissing
    code: creatureGroup->FormationReset(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Formation and Dismiss Group
    code: creatureGroup->FormationReset(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid creature groups that have been
    properly initialized. The dismiss parameter affects the group's current state,
    so calling this method while creatures are actively engaged in combat may cause
    unexpected behavior. It is recommended to call this method during safe transitions
    or when the group is not actively participating in combat.
  warnings: Calling FormationReset with dismiss=true on a group that is currently
    in combat may lead to creatures losing their AI context and potentially becoming
    unresponsive. Always ensure proper state management before invoking this method,
    especially in active combat scenarios.
