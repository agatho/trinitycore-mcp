  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the GroupCoordinator instance, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing it for group management operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a GroupCoordinator object for use by
    establishing necessary internal state, allocating required resources, and configuring
    default settings. This method is typically called during the creation or activation
    of a group coordination system within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that
    all underlying data structures are properly initialized before any group-related
    operations can be performed. The initialization process may include setting up
    event handlers, initializing member lists, and preparing synchronization mechanisms
    for multi-threaded environments.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.Initialize();

      // Coordinator is now ready to manage groups'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a GroupCoordinator
    instance. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method is typically invoked automatically by the framework when a group management
    system is activated, but can also be manually called in custom implementations.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same GroupCoordinator instance
    without proper cleanup can result in memory leaks or corrupted internal state.
    Ensure that all group operations are completed and resources released before calling
    this method again.
