  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: GetMetric
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::GetMetric(PerformanceMetric metric) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value of a specified performance metric from the profile.
  description: The GetMetric method retrieves a floating-point value representing
    a specific performance metric stored within the PerformanceProfile instance. This
    method allows access to various profiling data points such as frame times, memory
    usage, or other performance-related measurements. The method takes a PerformanceMetric
    enumeration value to identify which specific metric should be returned. It is
    typically used for debugging, monitoring, or analyzing game performance during
    development and testing phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the requested performance metric. The actual
    meaning of this value depends on the specific PerformanceMetric enum value passed
    to the method. Returns 0.0 if the specified metric is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve frame time metric
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      float frameTime = profile.GetMetric(PerformanceMetric::FRAME_TIME);

      // frameTime now contains the current frame time in milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Access memory usage metric
    code: "PerformanceProfile* profiler = sWorld->GetPerformanceProfiler();\nif (profiler)\n\
      {\n    float memoryUsage = profiler->GetMetric(PerformanceMetric::MEMORY_USAGE);\n\
      \    // Use memoryUsage for performance analysis\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with performance profiling tools
    and should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The PerformanceProfile
    class may cache metric values, so calling this method multiple times for the same
    metric might return cached results rather than recalculating them.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceProfile instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing metrics from an uninitialized or invalid profile
    may result in undefined behavior. Also be aware that some performance metrics
    may not be available in all build configurations or during certain game states.
