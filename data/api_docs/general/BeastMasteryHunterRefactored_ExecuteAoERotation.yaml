  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the optimized ability rotation for a Beast Mastery Hunter in AoE
    combat scenarios.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method manages the core AI logic for a Beast
    Mastery Hunter during area-of-effect encounters. It evaluates the current combat
    state, selects appropriate abilities based on resource levels and cooldowns, and
    applies the most efficient rotation sequence to maximize damage output against
    multiple targets. This method integrates with the hunter's pet management system,
    ability prioritization rules, and resource tracking mechanisms to ensure optimal
    performance in group or raid environments.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      within the combat environment. Used to determine which targets are currently
      engaged and eligible for AoE abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        int targetIndex = 0;\n        ExecuteAoERotation(&targetIndex);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Selection Logic
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (!target || *target < 0)\n        return;\n\n    // Evaluate number\
      \ of targets in range\n    uint8 targetCount = GetTargetsInRange(10.0f);\n \
      \   if (targetCount >= 3)\n    {\n        // Execute AoE rotation logic\n  \
      \      DoExecuteAOERotation();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter's pet is active and properly positioned
    before execution. It relies on internal state tracking of cooldowns, resource
    levels, and target information to make tactical decisions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization or while the hunter
    is not in combat may result in undefined behavior or incorrect ability usage.
    Ensure all preconditions are met before invocation.
