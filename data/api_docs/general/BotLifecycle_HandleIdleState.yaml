documentation:
  brief: Processes idle state logic for bot characters, handling behavior when bots
    are not engaged in active tasks.
  description: The HandleIdleState method manages the behavioral logic for bot characters
    when they are in an idle state. This method is typically called during the game
    loop to update bot status and determine appropriate actions when no active tasks
    or combat situations are present. It may handle activities such as looting nearby
    items, following a designated path, or transitioning between different states
    based on configured parameters. The method operates on a time-based diff parameter
    that indicates elapsed milliseconds since last execution, allowing for precise
    timing of idle behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& bot : botManager->GetAllBots())\n\
      \    {\n        bot->GetLifecycle()->HandleIdleState(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly from the main game loop. It
    should not block execution as it's part of real-time update processing. The implementation
    likely uses internal state tracking to determine when bots should transition between
    idle and active states.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to bots appearing stuck or unresponsive.
    Ensure that all bot-specific idle behaviors are properly configured to prevent
    infinite loops or excessive CPU usage during idle periods.
