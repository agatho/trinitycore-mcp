  method: CompareBotPerformance
  signature: bool BotProfiler::CompareBotPerformance(uint32_t botGuid1, uint32_t botGuid2,
    std::string & comparisonReport)
documentation:
  brief: Compares performance metrics between two bot instances in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The CompareBotPerformance method evaluates and contrasts the performance
    characteristics of two specified bot instances identified by their unique GUIDs.
    It collects relevant profiling data from both bots, such as execution time, resource
    usage, and behavior patterns, then generates a detailed comparison report. This
    functionality is primarily used for debugging, optimization, and ensuring consistent
    bot behavior within the World of Warcraft emulation environment. The method requires
    that both bot instances are active and properly initialized in the system before
    performing any comparisons.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid1
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the first bot instance to be compared.
  - name: botGuid2
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the second bot instance to be compared.
  - name: comparisonReport
    description: Output parameter that will contain a formatted string describing
      the performance differences between the two bots.
  returns: Returns true if the comparison was successful and valid data could be retrieved
    for both bots; otherwise returns false, indicating either one or both of the specified
    bot GUIDs were invalid or inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Performance Comparison
    code: "uint32_t guid1 = 1001;\nuint32_t guid2 = 1002;\nstd::string report;\nif\
      \ (botProfiler.CompareBotPerformance(guid1, guid2, report)) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Comparison Report:\\n\" << report << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"Failed to compare bot performance.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bots are already registered and active within
    the TrinityCore environment. The comparison report includes timing data, memory
    usage statistics, and any detected anomalies in behavior patterns. For optimal
    results, ensure both bots have been running for sufficient time to gather meaningful
    metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs will result
    in a failure return value without modifying the output parameter. Additionally,
    if either bot is currently executing a long-running task, the comparison may not
    reflect accurate real-time performance data.
