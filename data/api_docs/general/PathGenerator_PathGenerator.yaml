documentation:
  brief: Moves a PathGenerator object, transferring ownership of its resources to
    the new instance.
  description: The PathGenerator move constructor transfers all internal resources
    and state from the source PathGenerator object to the newly constructed one. This
    operation is typically used when creating a new PathGenerator instance by moving
    an existing one, avoiding expensive deep copies. After the move, the source object
    is left in a valid but unspecified state, suitable for immediate destruction or
    assignment. The move constructor is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics
    and allows efficient resource management in scenarios where objects are temporarily
    owned and then transferred between entities, such as during container reallocations
    or function returns.

  examples:
  - title: Move PathGenerator to new variable
    code: 'PathGenerator originalPath;

      // ... populate originalPath with path data ...

      PathGenerator newPath = std::move(originalPath);

      // originalPath is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // newPath contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in function return
    code: "PathGenerator generatePath()\n{\n    PathGenerator path;\n    // ... populate\
      \ path ...\n    return path; // Move constructor invoked here\n}\n\n// Usage:\n\
      PathGenerator myPath = generatePath();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed to be efficient
    and avoid deep copying of internal data structures. The source object after the
    move should not be used for operations that require valid state unless it's immediately
    reassigned or destroyed.
  warnings: Do not use the source PathGenerator object after moving it unless you
    explicitly reassign or reset it. Using a moved-from object in an invalid state
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
