documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a bot player instance by its unique identifier (GUID) from the
    system
  description: The GetBot method is used to retrieve a specific bot player object
    within the TrinityCore framework using its unique global identifier. This method
    serves as a lookup mechanism for accessing existing bot instances that have been
    previously created or initialized within the game world. The returned Player pointer
    can be used to interact with the bot's properties, behaviors, and actions. It
    is commonly utilized in AI processing systems where bots need to be accessed by
    their GUID for state management, action execution, or communication purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot player to retrieve.
      This value should correspond to a valid bot instance that has been registered
      with the system.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Player object representing the bot if found, or
    nullptr if no bot exists with the specified GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot retrieval
    code: "Player* bot = botActionProcessor->GetBot(12345);\nif (bot != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Bot found, perform actions\n    bot->Say(\"Hello World!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      } else {\n    // No bot with this GUID exists\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot not\
      \ found\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe bot access with error handling
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 98765;\nPlayer* bot = botActionProcessor->GetBot(botGuid);\n\
      if (bot && bot->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Perform safe operations on the bot\n\
      \    bot->SetHealth(100);\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to retrieve\
      \ valid bot with GUID: %u\", botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that bots are registered in a lookup table or container
    within the BotActionProcessor class. The implementation may involve thread-safe
    access patterns depending on how the internal storage is managed. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account if this method is called frequently
    during AI processing loops.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer must be validated for null before use to prevent
    segmentation faults. If a bot with the specified GUID does not exist or has been
    destroyed, the method will return nullptr. Always check the return value before
    dereferencing the pointer.
