  method: AdaptStrategyBasedOnPerformance
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::AdaptStrategyBasedOnPerformance(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the dungeon strategy based on performance metrics and group composition
  description: The AdaptStrategyBasedOnPerformance method dynamically modifies the
    behavior of a dungeon encounter by analyzing real-time performance data from the
    group. This includes evaluating player health, mana usage, combat efficiency,
    and overall group coordination to optimize encounter difficulty and pacing. The
    method adjusts tactics such as enemy spawn timing, loot distribution, or encounter
    mechanics to ensure an engaging yet achievable experience for the players. It
    is typically invoked during active dungeon encounters when performance data indicates
    a need for strategic adaptation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the current dungeon party.
      This parameter is essential as it provides access to all group members' status,
      abilities, and performance metrics used in strategy adaptation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isInDungeon())\n    {\n   \
      \     dungeonBehavior.AdaptStrategyBasedOnPerformance(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with performance monitoring system
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::AdaptStrategyBasedOnPerformance(Group* group)\n{\n\
      \    if (!group || !group->isInDungeon())\n        return;\n\n    // Analyze\
      \ group performance metrics\n    float avgHealth = CalculateAverageHealth(group);\n\
      \    float avgMana = CalculateAverageMana(group);\n    float combatEfficiency\
      \ = CalculateCombatEfficiency(group);\n\n    // Adjust strategy based on metrics\n\
      \    if (avgHealth < 0.3f || combatEfficiency < 0.4f)\n        IncreaseEnemySpawnRate();\n\
      \    else if (avgMana > 0.8f && combatEfficiency > 0.7f)\n        ReduceEnemySpawnRate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active dungeon encounters where
    performance data is meaningful. The strategy adaptation logic may include modifying
    encounter timers, adjusting enemy behavior patterns, or changing loot distribution
    rates. It's recommended to call this method at regular intervals (e.g., every
    30 seconds) during combat to maintain optimal difficulty balance.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group pointer or outside of a dungeon
    context can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is properly initialized
    and that all players are within the same dungeon instance before invoking this
    method.
