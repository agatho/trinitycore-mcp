  class: IBotSessionFactory
  method: ~IBotSessionFactory
  signature: void IBotSessionFactory::~IBotSessionFactory()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the bot session factory instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotSessionFactory class is responsible for
    cleaning up any resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the factory
    instance. This includes releasing memory, closing connections, or performing any
    necessary cleanup operations to ensure no resource leaks occur. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this method would typically be called when a bot
    session factory is no longer needed, such as during server shutdown or when unloading
    bot-related modules. The destructor ensures that all dependent objects and sessions
    are properly terminated before the factory itself is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of a bot session factory
    code: 'IBotSessionFactory* factory = new BotSessionFactory();

      // ... use the factory ...

      delete factory; // Triggers ~IBotSessionFactory()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, indicating that IBotSessionFactory is designed
    to be used as a base class. Derived classes should implement their own destructors
    to handle specific cleanup tasks. The destructor should not throw exceptions and
    must ensure all child objects are properly destroyed.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on a pointer unless you're certain
    it was allocated with 'new'. Always use 'delete' to invoke the destructor, which
    ensures proper cleanup of derived class members.
