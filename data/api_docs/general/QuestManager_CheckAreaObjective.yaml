documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has met the area objective requirements for a specified
    quest.
  description: The CheckAreaObjective method evaluates whether the player's current
    location and surrounding environment satisfy the area-based objectives defined
    in a given quest. This method is typically used during quest progression to determine
    if the player has entered the required zones or areas to advance the quest. It
    performs checks against the quest's area objective criteria, which may include
    entering specific zones, completing area-based tasks, or meeting location-based
    conditions. The method returns true if all area objectives are satisfied and false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for quests that require players to explore
    specific regions or complete actions within designated areas.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being evaluated. Must not be null. Represents
      the quest whose area objectives are being checked.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific area objective within the quest's objective
      list. Zero-based indexing is used. Must be a valid index for the quest's objectives
      array.
  returns: Returns true if the player has met all area requirements for the specified
    quest objective, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the area
    objective has been completed and the quest can proceed to the next stage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Objective Check
    code: "if (questManager->CheckAreaObjective(quest, 0)) {\n    // Player has met\
      \ the first area objective\n    player->CompleteQuest(quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Area Objectives
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < quest->GetObjectiveCount(); ++i) {\n    if (questManager->CheckAreaObjective(quest,\
      \ i)) {\n        // Process completed objective\n        questManager->UpdateQuestObjective(player,\
      \ quest, i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current position and zone information
    to evaluate area objectives. It may involve database lookups or complex spatial
    calculations depending on how the quest's area requirements are defined. The method
    is typically called during quest update cycles or when players interact with quest-related
    NPCs or objects.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, make sure the objectiveIndex
    is within bounds of the quest's actual objectives to avoid memory access violations.
