documentation:
  brief: Initializes explicit targets for spell casting.
  description: This method sets up the target specifications for a spell cast, defining
    where and how the spell should be applied. It is used to configure the spell's
    targetting parameters before execution, ensuring proper handling of target selection
    and positioning within the game mechanics framework. The method prepares the spell's
    target data structure based on provided SpellCastTargets object.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: The SpellCastTargets object containing target information for the
      spell. This includes target type, position, and other relevant parameters that
      define how the spell should be cast.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Target Initialization
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->InitExplicitTargets(SpellCastTargets);

      // Spell now has explicit target configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell initialization phase and should
    be used before the spell is actually cast. The method ensures that target data
    is properly set up for subsequent spell execution.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect target configuration
    can lead to failed spell casts or unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
