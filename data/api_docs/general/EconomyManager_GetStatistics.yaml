api:
  class: EconomyManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & EconomyManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current economy statistics for the server
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the Statistics
    object that contains various economic metrics and data points for the server's
    economy. This includes information such as gold earned, items sold, auction house
    activity, and other relevant financial indicators within the game world. The returned
    Statistics object is immutable, ensuring that external code cannot modify the
    internal economy state through this interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing current economy
    metrics and data points for the server
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Economy Statistics
    code: 'const Statistics& stats = economyManager.GetStatistics();

      uint64_t totalGoldEarned = stats.totalGoldEarned;

      uint32_t itemsSold = stats.itemsSold;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the economy data at the time
    of the call. Since it's a constant reference, modifications to the underlying
    data structure are not possible through this method. The statistics may be updated
    periodically by internal systems and should be retrieved fresh when needed for
    accurate data.
