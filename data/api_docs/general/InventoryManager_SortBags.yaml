  brief: Sorts the player's inventory bags in ascending order by bag ID.
  description: The SortBags method reorganizes the player's inventory bags to ensure
    they are sorted in ascending order based on their bag identifiers. This operation
    typically occurs when the player's inventory is modified, such as when items are
    added or removed from bags. The sorting ensures that bags appear in a consistent
    and predictable order within the player's inventory interface. This method does
    not modify item contents or positions within bags, only the ordering of the bags
    themselves.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when inventory
    modifications occur. It ensures that bag ordering remains consistent with the
    player's inventory state and UI presentation.
