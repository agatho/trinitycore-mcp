  class: FormationUtils
  method: IsRoleCompatibleWithFormation
  signature: bool FormationUtils::IsRoleCompatibleWithFormation(FormationRole role,
    FormationType formation)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified formation role is compatible with a given
    formation type.
  description: The IsRoleCompatibleWithFormation method evaluates if a provided FormationRole
    can be used within a specific FormationType. This utility function is typically
    employed in group management systems to ensure that units or players are assigned
    roles that align with the intended formation structure. It helps maintain proper
    tactical positioning and role distribution during group activities such as raids,
    dungeons, or player-vs-player encounters. The method performs a logical check
    based on predefined compatibility rules between roles and formations.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The FormationRole to evaluate for compatibility. Valid values are
      typically defined by an enumeration that includes roles such as LEADER, TANK,
      HEALER, DAMAGE, etc.
  - name: formation
    description: The FormationType against which the role compatibility is checked.
      This represents a specific group formation structure like GROUP, RAID, BATTLEGROUND,
      or CUSTOM.
  returns: Returns true if the specified role is compatible with the given formation
    type; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role-Formation Compatibility Check
    code: 'bool isCompatible = FormationUtils::IsRoleCompatibleWithFormation(FormationRole::HEALER,
      FormationType::RAID);

      // Returns true if healer role is allowed in raid formation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Group Assignment Logic
    code: "if (FormationUtils::IsRoleCompatibleWithFormation(playerRole, currentFormation))\
      \ {\n    // Assign player to the group with this role\n    group->AssignPlayer(player,\
      \ playerRole);\n} else {\n    // Handle incompatible role assignment\n    SendErrorToPlayer(\"\
      Role not compatible with current formation\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal lookup tables or rule sets to determine
    compatibility. Developers should be aware that changes to these rules may affect
    existing group behavior. The function is expected to be lightweight and suitable
    for frequent calls during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationRole and FormationType enums are properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid enum values could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
