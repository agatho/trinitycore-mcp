  class: BehaviorCluster
  method: RemoveProfile
  signature: void BehaviorCluster::RemoveProfile(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a behavior profile from the cluster by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveProfile method removes a specific behavior profile from the
    BehaviorCluster based on the provided GUID. This operation typically occurs when
    a behavior profile is no longer needed or has been replaced. The method ensures
    that any references to the specified profile are cleaned up within the cluster's
    internal data structures. It is commonly used during runtime when managing dynamic
    AI behaviors for NPCs or game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the behavior profile to be removed
      from the cluster. This value must correspond to an existing profile that was
      previously added to the cluster.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorCluster cluster;

      // Assume a profile with GUID 12345 has been added

      cluster.RemoveProfile(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Removal
    code: "if (cluster.HasProfile(67890)) {\n    cluster.RemoveProfile(67890);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid profile
    within the cluster. If the GUID does not exist, the behavior is undefined and
    may result in internal inconsistencies or crashes. The operation should be performed
    safely within the context of the AI system's lifecycle.
  warnings: Calling RemoveProfile with an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to
    memory corruption or unexpected behavior. Always ensure that the profile exists
    before attempting removal. This method should not be called concurrently from
    multiple threads without proper synchronization.
