  class: PathOptimizer
  method: SetOptimizationLevel
  signature: void PathOptimizer::SetOptimizationLevel(OptimizationLevel level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the optimization level for pathfinding calculations within the PathOptimizer
    class.
  description: The SetOptimizationLevel method configures the degree of path optimization
    applied by the PathOptimizer. This setting affects how aggressively the system
    simplifies and improves paths, balancing between computation time and path quality.
    Higher optimization levels typically result in shorter, more efficient paths but
    require more processing time. The method accepts an OptimizationLevel enumeration
    value that defines the desired balance between performance and path quality. This
    configuration is crucial for AI behavior and movement logic in World of Warcraft
    environments where efficient pathfinding is essential for NPC and player movement.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The optimization level to apply, specified as an OptimizationLevel
      enumeration value. Valid values typically include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and possibly
      others depending on implementation. LOW optimization prioritizes speed over
      path quality, MEDIUM provides a balanced approach, while HIGH optimization focuses
      on generating the most efficient paths at the cost of increased processing time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting High Optimization Level
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetOptimizationLevel(OptimizationLevel::HIGH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Medium Optimization for Balanced Performance
    code: "PathOptimizer* pathFinder = new PathOptimizer();\npathFinder->SetOptimizationLevel(OptimizationLevel::MEDIUM);\n\
      // Used in AI movement logic where performance and path quality are both important\n\
      if (player->GetMap()->IsInLineOfSight(player->GetPosition(), targetPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Direct path may be acceptable\n} else {\n    // Use optimized pathfinding\n\
      \    pathFinder->CalculatePath(player->GetPosition(), targetPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any path calculations to ensure
    the optimization settings are properly applied. The actual performance impact
    and path quality improvements depend on the specific implementation of the PathOptimizer
    class and the complexity of the navigation mesh. Changes to optimization level
    do not affect already calculated paths but will influence future pathfinding operations.
  warnings: Setting optimization levels too high may cause noticeable delays in path
    calculation, especially for complex environments with many obstacles. Ensure that
    optimization settings are appropriate for your specific use case and performance
    requirements. Incorrectly setting the optimization level can lead to either inefficient
    paths or excessive CPU usage during pathfinding operations.
