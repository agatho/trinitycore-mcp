documentation:
  brief: Converts a ResourceEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of the ResourceEvent
    instance, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying event information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly employed in TrinityCore's event
    handling system to serialize resource-related events for monitoring and diagnostics
    purposes. The output string usually contains key identifying information about
    the event such as its type, associated resource ID, and potentially timestamp
    or state data. No specific preconditions are required for calling this method,
    and it is generally safe to invoke from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the ResourceEvent
    object that includes relevant identifying and descriptive information about the
    event instance
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'ResourceEvent event;

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("resource", "Resource event occurred: {}", eventString);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Event Processing Context
    code: "void HandleResourceEvent(ResourceEvent const& event)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      resource\", \"Processing event: {}\", event.ToString());\n    // Process event\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact format of the returned string may vary depending on the implementation
    details of the ResourceEvent class. This method is typically not performance-critical
    and should not be called in high-frequency loops. The method is marked as const,
    indicating it does not modify the object state.
