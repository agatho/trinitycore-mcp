  signature: void AreaTriggerSphere::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger sphere, resetting its update
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerSphere instance. This operation is typically used during the update
    cycle to indicate that all previously marked changes have been processed and should
    no longer be considered as pending updates. It ensures that subsequent calls to
    methods checking for changes will not report stale or already handled modifications.
    The method is commonly invoked by the game server's update loop to maintain synchronization
    between the server state and client-side representations of area triggers.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void AreaTriggerSphere::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... update logic\
      \ ...\n    if (HasChanges())\n    {\n        // Send updates to players\n  \
      \      SendPacketToPlayers();\n    }\n    ClearChangesMask(); // Reset mask\
      \ after processing changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after all pending changes have been properly
    handled and sent to affected clients. Failure to call this method may result in
    continuous reporting of changes, leading to unnecessary network traffic or performance
    degradation.
