  class: AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck
  method: AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck::AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck(int
    * funit, int * enemy, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for any assist creature within a specified range of the
    player.
  description: The AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck constructor initializes a check that
    determines whether there are any assist creatures (such as pets or summoned minions)
    within a given distance from the player. This functionality is commonly used in
    AI logic to evaluate the presence of nearby friendly units for tactical decision-making,
    such as choosing when to engage enemies or reposition during combat. The method
    sets up internal state variables based on provided parameters to perform range-based
    checks efficiently.
  parameters:
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to a unit representing the friendly unit (e.g., player or
      pet) for which the check is performed.
  - name: enemy
    description: Pointer to an enemy unit that may be used in determining assist behavior
      or context for the range check.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) within which assist creatures are
      considered valid for the check.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize assist creature check with player and enemy units
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      Unit* targetEnemy = ...;

      float checkRange = 30.0f;

      AnyAssistCreatureInRangeCheck checker(&player, &targetEnemy, checkRange);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class likely implements a functor-style interface for use within AI
    decision trees or range-based evaluation systems in TrinityCore. It is designed
    to be lightweight and efficient for frequent checks during combat logic.
