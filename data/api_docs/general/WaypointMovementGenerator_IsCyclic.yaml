  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: IsCyclic
  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::IsCyclic() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the waypoint movement generator is set to loop continuously
    through waypoints.
  description: The IsCyclic method checks if the WaypointMovementGenerator is configured
    to repeat its waypoint path indefinitely. When cyclic behavior is enabled, the
    creature or unit will return to the first waypoint after reaching the last one,
    creating a continuous loop. This is commonly used for patrol behaviors where NPCs
    should continuously follow the same route. The method returns true if the movement
    is cyclic and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for defining continuous
    AI movement patterns in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the waypoint movement generator is set to loop continuously
    through waypoints, false if it stops at the final waypoint.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature's movement is cyclic
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nMovementGenerator* movementGen = creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (movementGen && movementGen->GetMovementGeneratorType() == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_WAYPOINT)\n\
      {\n    WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = static_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(movementGen);\n\
      \    bool isCyclic = wpGen->IsCyclic();\n    if (isCyclic)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Creature is following a cyclic waypoint path.\");\n    else\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Creature will stop at the final waypoint.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other waypoint movement
    controls to manage NPC patrol behavior. The cyclic setting affects how the movement
    generator handles path completion and whether it automatically restarts from the
    beginning of the waypoint list.
