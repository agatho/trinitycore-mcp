  class: Channel
  method: SetInvisible
  signature: void Channel::SetInvisible(const Player * player, bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the invisible status of a player in the channel.
  description: The SetInvisible method controls whether a specific player is visible
    or hidden within a channel. When invoked with 'on' set to true, the player becomes
    invisible to other members of the channel, effectively removing them from the
    visible member list. Conversely, when 'on' is false, the player becomes visible
    again. This functionality is commonly used for players who wish to observe channel
    communications without being seen or for implementing stealth mechanics in-game.
    The method operates on a per-player basis and does not affect the channel's overall
    visibility settings.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose invisible status will be modified.
      Must not be null.
  - name: 'on'
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to set the player as invisible (true)
      or visible (false) in the channel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Make Player Invisible
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("General", player->GetTeam());

      channel->SetInvisible(player, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reveal Invisible Player
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Guild\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->SetInvisible(player, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal channel member lists and may trigger visibility
    updates to other players in the same channel. It is typically called during player
    login/logout or when applying temporary invisibility effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also note that setting
    a player invisible does not prevent them from sending messages; it only affects
    their visibility status in the channel.
