  method: ChangeMemberRole
  signature: bool FormationManager::ChangeMemberRole(Player * player, FormationRole
    newRole)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the role of a player member within a formation.
  description: The ChangeMemberRole method updates the formation role assigned to
    a specific player within a group or formation. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage group dynamics, such as designating
    tanks, healers, or damage dealers within a raid or party. The method validates
    the provided role and ensures that the player exists within the current formation
    before attempting to modify their role. It returns true upon successful role update,
    or false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters or internal errors.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose formation role is to be changed.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid player currently in a formation.
  - name: newRole
    description: The new FormationRole value to assign to the player. Valid roles
      are typically defined by the FormationRole enumeration, such as LEADER, TANK,
      HEALER, or DAMAGE_DEALER.
  returns: Returns true if the player's role was successfully updated within the formation;
    otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid input, player not
    found in formation, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nFormationRole\
      \ newRole = FormationRole::HEALER;\nbool success = formationManager->ChangeMemberRole(targetPlayer,\
      \ newRole);\nif (success) {\n    // Role updated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nFormationRole role\
      \ = FormationRole::TANK;\nif (formationManager->ChangeMemberRole(player, role))\
      \ {\n    // Role changed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %s role\
      \ updated to TANK.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ change role\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to update role for player %s.\",\
      \ player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already part of a formation. It does
    not validate whether the player is in a group or raid, but rather operates on
    an existing formation structure. The implementation may internally check for valid
    roles and player membership before applying changes.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'player' will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crash. Ensure that the player object is valid and exists within the current
    formation before calling this method. Also, make sure the newRole value corresponds
    to a valid FormationRole enumeration member.
