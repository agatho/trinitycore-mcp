  class: ArenaAI
  method: IsInLineOfSight
  signature: bool ArenaAI::IsInLineOfSight(int * player, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has line of sight to a target within arena combat mechanics.
  description: The IsInLineOfSight method determines whether a player in an arena
    environment can see a target unit without any obstructions. This is crucial for
    determining valid targeting and spell casting during arena battles, where players
    must have clear visibility to engage opponents. The method evaluates the spatial
    relationship between the player and target, considering environmental obstacles
    and game physics. It's typically used by AI systems to make decisions about when
    to attack or cast spells based on visibility conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is checking line of sight
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that is being checked for visibility
  returns: Returns true if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the player
    and target, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can visually perceive
    the target in the arena environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "if (arenaAI->IsInLineOfSight(&player, &target)) {\n    // Player can see\
      \ target, proceed with attack\n    player.CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Target is obstructed, find alternative approach\n    player.MoveTo(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using line of sight for spell targeting
    code: "Unit* currentTarget = player.GetTarget();\nif (currentTarget && arenaAI->IsInLineOfSight(&player,\
      \ &currentTarget)) {\n    // Execute spell only if target is visible\n    if\
      \ (player.HasSpell(SPELL_BLINK)) {\n        player.CastSpell(currentTarget,\
      \ SPELL_BLINK);\n    }\n    player.CastSpell(currentTarget, SPELL_ARCANE_SHOT);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer or find a better angle\n    player.SetMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_RUN);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial calculations using the game's collision
    detection system to determine if any environmental objects block the view between
    player and target. It may cache results or use optimized algorithms for performance
    in high-frequency arena combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes valid pointers are passed; passing null pointers will
    result in undefined behavior. In arena environments, this check is essential for
    proper spell targeting and AI decision making, but may not account for all visual
    effects like invisibility or stealth.
