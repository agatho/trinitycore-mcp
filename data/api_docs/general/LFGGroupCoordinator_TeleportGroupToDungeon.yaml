  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::TeleportGroupToDungeon(Group * group, uint32
    dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a group to a specified dungeon location.
  description: The TeleportGroupToDungeon method is responsible for initiating the
    process of teleporting an entire group of players to a designated dungeon instance.
    This method is typically used within the LFG (Looking For Group) system to move
    groups from the waiting area to their assigned dungeon. It handles the coordination
    of multiple player teleports and ensures that all group members are moved together
    to maintain group integrity. The method checks for valid group membership, dungeon
    availability, and proper LFG state before attempting the teleportation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players to
      be teleported. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon to which the group will be teleported.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the game's dungeon database and must represent
      a valid dungeon instance.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation process was successfully initiated for
    all group members, false otherwise. The method may return false if the group is
    invalid, the dungeon ID is invalid, or if any of the players in the group are
    unable to be teleported due to game state restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Teleportation
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nuint32 dungeonId = 1234;\nbool success\
      \ = LFGGroupCoordinator::TeleportGroupToDungeon(myGroup, dungeonId);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Group teleportation initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group teleported to dungeon %u\", dungeonId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle teleportation\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to teleport group to dungeon %u\", dungeonId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and relies on proper LFG state management.
    The actual teleportation may not occur immediately but rather through a queued
    process that respects game mechanics like instance locking, player availability,
    and group synchronization. Developers should ensure that the group has proper
    LFG status before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or an invalid dungeon
    ID will likely result in undefined behavior or failure. Always validate group
    membership and dungeon existence before invoking this method. Additionally, be
    aware that this method may not immediately teleport players; it initiates the
    process which can involve multiple steps including instance creation and player
    movement.
