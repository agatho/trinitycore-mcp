documentation:
  brief: Returns the bag family type identifier for the item template.
  description: The GetBagFamily method retrieves the bag family type associated with
    an item template. This value determines which types of bags an item can be placed
    into, such as quivers, leatherworking bags, or mining bags. The returned value
    corresponds to the BagFamily.dbc entry in the game database and is used during
    inventory operations to validate bag compatibility. This method does not perform
    any validation checks and simply returns the stored family value from the item
    template data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the bag family type identifier. This corresponds
    to entries in the BagFamily.dbc file and defines which bag types can hold this
    item. Common values include 1 for quivers, 2 for bags, 4 for soulsacks, etc.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ bagFamily = itemTemplate->GetBagFamily();\nif (bagFamily == 1) {\n    // This\
      \ item is a quiver\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Validation
    code: "ItemTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(itemId);\nuint32 requiredFamily\
      \ = template->GetBagFamily();\n// Check if the bag can hold this item\nif (bagTemplate->GetBagFamily()\
      \ & requiredFamily) {\n    // Item can be placed in this bag\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The bag family value is loaded from the Item.dbc file during server startup
    and cached in the ItemTemplate structure. This method is thread-safe as it only
    reads from immutable data structures. The returned value represents a bitmask
    that can be combined with other bag family values for compatibility checks.
  warnings: This method returns raw database values without validation. Developers
    should ensure they understand the meaning of bag family constants before using
    bitwise operations on the return value. Incorrect interpretation of the bitmask
    may lead to inventory system bugs.
