  class: TargetSelector
  method: IsInterruptible
  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsInterruptible(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit can be interrupted during spell casting.
  description: The IsInterruptible method evaluates if a given unit is currently in
    a state where its spell casting can be interrupted by external effects. This is
    commonly used in AI behavior to decide whether to apply interrupt mechanics such
    as silence, spell reflection, or other abilities that break spell casts. The method
    checks various conditions including the target's current spell state, immunity
    flags, and whether the unit is engaged in a non-interruptible casting state like
    certain boss abilities or specific player actions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for interruptibility.
      This must be a valid pointer to a Unit instance, typically representing an NPC
      or player in combat.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit's current spell casting can be interrupted;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false usually indicates that the target
    is casting a spell that is immune to interruption or is in a special state where
    interruption is not allowed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsInterruptible(victim)) {\n    // Apply interrupt effect\
      \ such as silence\n    caster->CastSpell(victim, SPELL_SILENCE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional logic for spell selection
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsInterruptible(target)) {\n    // Choose an interruptible\
      \ spell\n    if (caster->HasSpell(SPELL_SHOCK)) {\n        caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SHOCK, true);\n    }\n} else {\n    // Fallback to non-interruptible\
      \ spell\n    caster->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on internal flags and states within the Unit
    class such as casting state, immunity status, and current spell effects. It's
    important to note that this check should be performed before applying interrupt
    mechanics to avoid unnecessary processing or invalid operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent access violations. Also, some high-priority spells or boss abilities may
    override standard interruptibility rules and return false even when they appear
    to be interruptible.
