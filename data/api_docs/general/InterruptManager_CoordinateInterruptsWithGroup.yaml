  method: CoordinateInterruptsWithGroup
  signature: void InterruptManager::CoordinateInterruptsWithGroup(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates interrupt handling among group members during spell casting or
    abilities.
  description: The CoordinateInterruptsWithGroup method manages synchronization of
    interrupt events within a player's group context. It ensures that when one member
    of a group performs an action that could interrupt another member's ongoing spell
    or ability, the system properly handles these interruptions across all group participants.
    This method is typically invoked during combat scenarios where group coordination
    is essential for maintaining proper gameplay mechanics and preventing desynchronization
    between players and their actions.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of members in the
      current group. This parameter determines how many interrupt events need to be
      coordinated among group participants.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Interrupt Coordination
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      int groupSize = player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();

      interruptMgr.CoordinateInterruptsWithGroup(groupSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt Coordination with Dynamic Group Size
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    InterruptManager interruptMgr;\n    const\
      \ int groupMembers = player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();\n    interruptMgr.CoordinateInterruptsWithGroup(groupMembers);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's combat system and group
    management components. It may perform internal checks to ensure that only valid
    group members are considered for interrupt coordination, and it might cache or
    queue interrupt events until all group participants have been processed.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group context may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player is part of a group before invoking
    this method. The method assumes that groupMembers parameter accurately reflects
    the current number of active group members.
