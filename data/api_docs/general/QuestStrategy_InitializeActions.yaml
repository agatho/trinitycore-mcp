  brief: Initializes quest-related AI actions for the player's current questing strategy
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures all available quest-related
    actions that the AI can execute during quest progression. This method is typically
    called when a player begins or reloads their questing strategy, ensuring that
    all relevant quest objectives, NPC interactions, and item collection actions are
    properly registered within the AI system. The method prepares the internal action
    list based on the current quest state and available quest data in the player's
    quest log.
