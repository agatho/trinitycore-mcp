documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player meets the conditions required for a future spell.
  description: This method checks if a player satisfies the prerequisites necessary
    for a spell to be cast in the future. It evaluates player conditions such as level
    requirements, class restrictions, and other game mechanics that affect spell casting.
    The method is typically used during spell validation processes to ensure that
    players can properly cast spells at a later time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all required conditions for the future
    spell; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->MeetsFutureSpellPlayerCondition(player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can cast the spell\n}\nelse {\n    // Player cannot cast the spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and is used primarily in spell
    validation logic. It relies on player's current state, including level, class,
    and other attributes.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for spell casting without proper
    validation checks; it is intended for internal use only.
