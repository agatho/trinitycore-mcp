  class: Corpse
  method: SetDisplayId
  signature: void Corpse::SetDisplayId(int displayId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the display ID of the corpse to control its visual appearance.
  description: The SetDisplayId method updates the visual representation of a Corpse
    object by assigning it a new display ID. This allows developers to change how
    the corpse appears in the game world, such as switching between different creature
    models or player character models when they die. The method directly modifies
    the internal display ID member of the Corpse class and is typically used during
    death animations or custom corpse behavior implementations. It does not validate
    the provided display ID against valid model IDs, so incorrect values may result
    in invisible or erroneous visuals.
  parameters:
  - name: displayId
    description: The new display ID to assign to the corpse. This should correspond
      to a valid creature or player model entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();

      corpse->SetDisplayId(12345); // Changes corpse to use model ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Corpse Model Based on Creature Type
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      Corpse* corpse = creature->GetCorpse();

      uint32 displayId = creature->GetNativeDisplayId();

      corpse->SetDisplayId(displayId); // Match the corpse''s appearance to the original
      creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only changes the visual representation of the corpse and does
    not affect its physical properties or behavior. It is recommended to validate
    display IDs against known valid entries in the game database to prevent rendering
    issues.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent display ID may cause the corpse to
    appear invisible or with incorrect visuals. Always ensure that the display ID
    corresponds to a valid model entry in the game's database before calling this
    method.
