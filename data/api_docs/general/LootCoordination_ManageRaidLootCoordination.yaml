  signature: void LootCoordination::ManageRaidLootCoordination(Group * raid, const
    int & raidLoot)
documentation:
  brief: Manages loot coordination for raid groups in World of Warcraft.
  description: The ManageRaidLootCoordination method handles the distribution and
    coordination of loot within a raid group. It ensures that loot is properly assigned
    to players according to the raid's loot settings, such as master loot, round-robin,
    or need-before-greed systems. This method typically integrates with the TrinityCore's
    group management system to maintain proper loot fairness and adherence to raid
    loot rules. The function operates on a provided Group object representing the
    raid and applies the specified loot rule to coordinate item distribution among
    raid members.
  parameters:
  - name: raid
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the raid for which loot
      coordination is being managed. Must be a valid raid group with at least one
      member.
  - name: raidLoot
    description: Integer value representing the current raid loot rule or system in
      use. Valid values typically correspond to predefined loot modes such as 0 (free
      for all), 1 (master loot), 2 (round-robin), or 3 (need before greed).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Raid Loot Coordination
    code: 'Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int lootMode = 1; // Master Loot

      LootCoordination::ManageRaidLootCoordination(raidGroup, lootMode);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Loot Mode Coordination
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    Group* raid = player->GetGroup();\n    int\
      \ currentLootMode = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_LOOT_METHOD);\n    LootCoordination::ManageRaidLootCoordination(raid,\
      \ currentLootMode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot distribution events and relies
    on the TrinityCore's internal loot system. The implementation assumes that all
    group members are valid players with appropriate permissions. It may trigger additional
    network packets to update client-side loot windows and notifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null or invalid group can lead to undefined behavior. The raidLoot parameter
    must be one of the supported loot modes; invalid values might cause unexpected
    loot distribution behavior.
