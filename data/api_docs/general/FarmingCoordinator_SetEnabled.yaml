  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::SetEnabled(int * player, bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables farming functionality for a specified player.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether a player's farming capabilities
    are active within the game world. This method takes a pointer to a player object
    and a boolean flag to determine if farming should be enabled or disabled. When
    enabled, players can interact with farming mechanics such as planting crops, harvesting
    yields, and managing their farm resources. The method likely updates internal
    state flags or triggers relevant game events to reflect the change in farming
    status. This functionality is typically used during gameplay events, server-side
    configuration changes, or player-specific toggling of farming features.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which farming functionality will
      be enabled or disabled. Must not be null.
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether farming should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false) for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable farming for a player
    code: 'Player* myPlayer = ...;

      FarmingCoordinator::SetEnabled(myPlayer, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable farming for a player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...;

      FarmingCoordinator::SetEnabled(targetPlayer, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state flags and may trigger UI
    updates or event notifications to reflect the change in farming status. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if called from different execution contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method may have performance implications
    if called frequently on many players simultaneously.
