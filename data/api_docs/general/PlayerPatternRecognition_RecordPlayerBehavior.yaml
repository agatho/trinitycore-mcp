  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordPlayerBehavior(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Records player behavior patterns for analysis and detection of anomalous
    gameplay.
  description: The RecordPlayerBehavior method captures and stores detailed behavioral
    data from a Player object, including movement patterns, interaction sequences,
    and game action timing. This functionality is typically used in anti-cheat systems
    or behavioral analytics to identify suspicious or automated player activities.
    The method likely aggregates data over time to build a baseline of normal behavior
    for comparison against future actions. It may also trigger alerts or logging when
    deviations from expected patterns are detected. The recorded data could include
    movement speed, keypress timing, mouse movements, and other gameplay metrics that
    help distinguish between human and bot-like behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage in Anti-Cheat System
    code: "void CheckPlayerBehavior(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition\
      \ patternRec;\n    patternRec.RecordPlayerBehavior(player);\n    // Further\
      \ analysis logic would follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger behavioral analytics framework. It
    may be called periodically or in response to specific game events to maintain
    an up-to-date behavioral profile of players. The implementation might involve
    caching recent actions and comparing them against known patterns of legitimate
    versus suspicious behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper context or filtering could
    lead to false positives in anti-cheat systems, potentially flagging legitimate
    players as cheaters. Developers should ensure that the behavioral data collected
    is used responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations.
