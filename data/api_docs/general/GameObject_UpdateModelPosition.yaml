documentation:
  brief: Updates the model position of the game object to match its current world
    position.
  description: The UpdateModelPosition method synchronizes the visual model position
    of a GameObject with its actual world coordinates. This ensures that the object's
    rendered appearance matches its physical location in the game world. The method
    is typically called when a GameObject's position changes, such as during movement,
    spawning, or teleportation events. It handles the necessary internal updates to
    maintain consistency between the object's physical and visual representations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->UpdateModelPosition();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Position Change
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->SetPosition(newX, newY, newZ, orientation);

      go->UpdateModelPosition();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called in many scenarios where position changes
    occur, but may need to be manually invoked when custom movement logic is implemented.
    The update process involves recalculating the model's world transform matrix and
    notifying the client about the position change.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in tight loops can cause performance issues
    due to the internal synchronization operations. Avoid calling it unnecessarily
    if the GameObject's position hasn't changed.
