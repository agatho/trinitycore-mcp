  class: Aura
  method: SetStackAmount
  signature: void Aura::SetStackAmount(uint8 num)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the stack amount of the aura to the specified value.
  description: The SetStackAmount method updates the number of times an aura is stacked
    on a target. In World of Warcraft mechanics, auras can be stacked multiple times,
    and each stack typically modifies the effect of the aura. This method directly
    modifies the internal stack count of the aura instance. The new stack amount must
    be a valid uint8 value, typically ranging from 1 to 255 depending on the aura
    type and game mechanics. Setting the stack amount to zero effectively removes
    the aura from the target.
  parameters:
  - name: num
    description: The new stack amount for the aura. Must be a valid uint8 value (0-255).
      A value of 0 will remove the aura completely.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Aura Stacks to 3
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetStackAmount(3);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Aura by Setting Zero Stacks
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nAura* aura = target->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n\
      {\n    aura->SetStackAmount(0); // Removes the aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the aura's stack count without triggering any
    additional events or recalculations. It is typically used internally by the core
    or by scripts that need to manipulate aura stacks directly. The method does not
    validate whether the new stack amount is within expected bounds for a specific
    aura type; it simply sets the value.
  warnings: Calling this method with a value of 0 will completely remove the aura
    from the target, which may have unintended consequences if other systems depend
    on the aura being present. Be cautious when modifying aura stacks directly as
    it bypasses normal game logic that might otherwise handle stack changes (e.g.,
    through spell effects or procs).
