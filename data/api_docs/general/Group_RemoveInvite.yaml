  method: RemoveInvite
  signature: void Group::RemoveInvite(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player's invite from the group, revoking their pending invitation
    status.
  description: The RemoveInvite method removes a specific player's invite from the
    group, effectively canceling their pending invitation to join the group. This
    method is typically called when a player declines an invitation or when the inviter
    wishes to revoke the invitation before the invited player accepts it. The method
    ensures that the player is no longer considered as having a pending invitation
    to the group and updates internal tracking structures accordingly. It does not
    affect players who are already members of the group.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose invite should be removed from
      the group. Must be a valid player instance that was previously invited to this
      group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Invite for Declined Player
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && player->IsInvited()) {\n\
      \    group->RemoveInvite(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Revoke Invitation Before Acceptance
    code: "Player* invitedPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(12345,\
      \ 0, HIGHGUID_PLAYER));\nGroup* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && invitedPlayer)\
      \ {\n    group->RemoveInvite(invitedPlayer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the invitation state and does not modify the group's
    member list or perform any cleanup for players already in the group. It is typically
    used in conjunction with other group management functions to maintain proper invitation
    flow.
