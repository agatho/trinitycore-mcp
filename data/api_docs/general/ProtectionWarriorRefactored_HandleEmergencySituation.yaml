  class: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  method: HandleEmergencySituation
  signature: void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::HandleEmergencySituation()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the emergency situational response behavior for a protection warrior,
    prioritizing threat management and defensive actions.
  description: The HandleEmergencySituation method represents a core defensive mechanism
    within the ProtectionWarriorRefactored class. This method is invoked when the
    warrior enters an urgent combat scenario, typically triggered by incoming high-damage
    attacks or sudden threat spikes. It activates a series of defensive measures including
    automatic shield block activation, threat reduction techniques, and prioritization
    of defensive cooldowns such as Defensive Stance or Shield Wall. The method ensures
    that the warrior maintains optimal protection for the tanking role while managing
    immediate survival needs. This function is designed to be called automatically
    by the AI system based on combat state changes and threat levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Situation Trigger
    code: "void BasicEmergencyExample()\n{\n    ProtectionWarriorRefactored* warrior\
      \ = new ProtectionWarriorRefactored();\n    warrior->HandleEmergencySituation();\
      \ // Activates emergency defensive behavior\n    delete warrior;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat scenarios where threat
    levels are elevated. The implementation assumes that the warrior's current target
    has sufficient threat to warrant emergency intervention. Performance is optimized
    for real-time combat situations with minimal latency requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or when no immediate threat exists
    may result in unnecessary resource consumption and potential performance degradation.
    Ensure proper threat management before invoking this function.
