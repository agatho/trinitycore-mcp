  signature: bool DifficultyCurve::IsTrained() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the difficulty curve is trained, typically indicating
    if a player has unlocked or progressed through a specific difficulty level.
  description: The IsTrained method checks if a DifficultyCurve object represents
    a trained state, which usually corresponds to whether a player has unlocked or
    completed content associated with that difficulty. This method is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's progression systems to determine if players can access
    higher difficulty content or if they have already progressed through certain stages.
    The implementation likely evaluates internal flags or progression states within
    the curve data structure. This check is essential for managing game progression,
    quest unlocks, and difficulty-based content availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the difficulty curve is trained (i.e., the player has unlocked
    or completed the associated content), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a DifficultyCurve is Trained
    code: "DifficultyCurve* curve = sObjectMgr->GetDifficultyCurve(12345);\nif (curve\
      \ && curve->IsTrained()) {\n    // Player has unlocked this difficulty\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Player has trained this difficulty curve.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player has not yet unlocked this difficulty\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player has not trained this difficulty curve.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple flag check on internal state variables.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other progression systems to gate access
    to higher difficulties or content. The method is expected to be lightweight and
    thread-safe as it only reads immutable state.
  warnings: Ensure that the DifficultyCurve object is valid before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. This method should
    not be used for modifying progression state; it's purely a read-only check.
