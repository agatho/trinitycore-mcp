  method: GetZoneCurrentBots
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerOptimized::GetZoneCurrentBots(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of bots active in a specified zone.
  description: The GetZoneCurrentBots method returns the count of active bot characters
    within a given zone identified by its zone ID. This function is typically used
    by the bot spawner system to monitor and manage bot population levels across different
    zones. The method provides real-time data on how many bots are currently spawned
    and operating in the specified zone, which can be useful for balancing gameplay,
    preventing overcrowding, or triggering spawn events based on current bot density.
    It's important to note that this count includes all active bots regardless of
    their specific role or behavior within the zone.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bots currently present
    in the specified zone. Returns 0 if no bots are active in the zone or if the zone
    ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get bot count for a specific zone
    code: "uint32 botCount = botSpawner->GetZoneCurrentBots(1234);\nif (botCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << botCount << \" bots currently in\
      \ zone 1234.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup operation on an internal data structure
    that tracks active bots per zone. The implementation may cache results or use
    optimized data structures for fast retrieval, especially in high-frequency scenarios
    like bot spawning logic. It's recommended to avoid calling this method excessively
    in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure the zone ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds to an
    actual zone in the game world. Passing invalid zone IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect counts. This method should not be used for real-time bot
    management decisions without considering potential race conditions in multi-threaded
    environments.
