  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: IsValidGroupTarget
  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::IsValidGroupTarget(Player * bot, Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is valid for group combat actions.
  description: The IsValidGroupTarget method evaluates if a given target unit is suitable
    for inclusion in group-based combat behaviors. It checks various conditions such
    as target validity, distance restrictions, faction alignment, and combat state
    to ensure that the bot will not engage invalid or harmful targets during group
    encounters. This method is typically used by AI systems within TrinityCore's group
    combat logic to filter potential targets before initiating actions like attack,
    follow, or assist.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      the target.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated as a potential
      group combat target.
  returns: Returns true if the target is valid for group combat actions, false otherwise.
    A valid target must be within acceptable range, not neutral or friendly to the
    bot, and in a combat-ready state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger.IsValidGroupTarget(bot, target)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with group combat action\n    bot->Attack(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group targeting system
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateGroupCombat() {\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n    Unit*\
      \ target = GetTarget();\n    if (target && groupCombatTrigger.IsValidGroupTarget(bot,\
      \ target)) {\n        // Execute combat behavior\n        DoCombatAction(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on core TrinityCore mechanics such as faction checking,
    visibility flags, and combat state tracking. It may be called frequently during
    AI updates, so performance is important. The implementation likely includes checks
    for target distance, hostility, and current combat status.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes. The method assumes the target is not null and properly
    initialized in the game world.
