  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::OnInterruptFailed(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an interrupt attempt fails on a target unit
  description: The OnInterruptFailed method is invoked when a combat specialization's
    interrupt ability fails to successfully interrupt an enemy target. This method
    is typically called as part of the combat system's interrupt mechanics, where
    a player or creature attempts to interrupt another unit's spell casting or ability
    usage. The method may perform cleanup operations, trigger visual effects, update
    combat state, or log the failed interrupt attempt for debugging purposes. It serves
    as a callback mechanism in the combat specialization system to handle unsuccessful
    interrupt scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was targeted for interruption. This
      represents the unit whose spell casting or ability usage failed to be interrupted.
      The target must be a valid Unit instance, typically an enemy unit in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt failure handling
    code: "class MyCombatSpecialization : public CombatSpecializationBase {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnInterruptFailed(Unit* target) override {\n        // Log the failed\
      \ interrupt attempt\n        if (target) {\n            sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Interrupt failed on target: %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n\
      \        // Perform any cleanup or state updates\n        // ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced interrupt failure with visual feedback
    code: "class AdvancedCombatSpecialization : public CombatSpecializationBase {\n\
      public:\n    void OnInterruptFailed(Unit* target) override {\n        if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsInWorld())\n            return;\n        \n        // Send a\
      \ visual effect to indicate failure\n        target->SendSpellVisual(45678);\
      \ // Example spell visual ID\n        \n        // Play sound effect\n     \
      \   target->PlayDistanceSound(12345); // Example sound ID\n        \n      \
      \  // Log for debugging\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_COMBAT, \"Interrupt\
      \ failed on %s (GUID: %u)\", target->GetName().c_str(), target->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat specialization system and should be overridden
    in derived classes to implement custom interrupt failure behavior. The target
    parameter may be null in edge cases, so proper null checking is recommended. This
    method is typically called from within the core combat interrupt logic and should
    not perform heavy operations that could impact performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before using it, as it might be
    null in certain edge cases. Avoid performing expensive operations in this method
    since it's called frequently during combat. Be aware that this method may be invoked
    from different threads depending on the combat system implementation.
