documentation:
  brief: Updates guild criteria progress based on specified type and miscellaneous
    values.
  description: The UpdateCriteria method is responsible for advancing or modifying
    a guild's criteria progress within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework.
    It takes a criteria type and associated miscellaneous values to determine how
    the guild's progress should be updated. This method is typically invoked when
    guild members perform actions that contribute to specific guild achievements or
    objectives, such as completing quests, earning reputation, or participating in
    events. The method interacts with the underlying criteria system to ensure that
    guild progress is accurately tracked and updated across all relevant systems.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of criteria to update. This value determines which specific
      guild achievement or objective is being progressed. Valid values are typically
      defined by the game's criteria system and correspond to predefined achievements
      or objectives.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: A miscellaneous value that provides additional context for the criteria
      update. The meaning of this value depends on the criteria type and may represent
      quantities, identifiers, or other relevant data needed to process the update.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: A second miscellaneous value used in conjunction with miscValue1
      to provide more detailed information for the criteria update. This parameter
      is often used when multiple values are required to determine progress.
  - name: miscValue3
    description: A third miscellaneous value that may be used to further refine or
      specify the criteria update. Like other misc values, its meaning depends on
      the specific criteria type being updated.
  - name: ref
    description: A pointer to a WorldObject reference that provides context for the
      criteria update. This may represent an item, NPC, quest, or other game object
      involved in the action triggering the criteria progress.
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object associated with the criteria update.
      This parameter identifies which player's actions are contributing to the guild
      criteria and is used for proper tracking and reward distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Guild Criteria for Quest Completion
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->UpdateCriteria(CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ questId, 0, 0, nullptr, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Guild Criteria with Multiple Parameters
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->UpdateCriteria(CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE,\
      \ creatureId, 10, 0, creature, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game systems when
    players perform actions that contribute to guild achievements. The method may
    trigger database updates and potentially send notifications to guild members about
    progress changes. Developers should be aware that this method does not directly
    handle reward distribution; it only updates the criteria progress which may later
    be processed for rewards.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid parameters can lead to incorrect
    guild progress tracking or potential crashes. The player parameter must not be
    null, and the ref parameter should be valid when required by the criteria type.
    This method is not thread-safe and should only be called from the main game thread.
