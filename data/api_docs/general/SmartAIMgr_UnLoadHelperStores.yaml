documentation:
  brief: Unloads all helper stores used by the SmartAI system.
  description: The UnLoadHelperStores method is responsible for cleaning up and releasing
    all memory associated with helper data structures used by the SmartAI system in
    TrinityCore. This method ensures that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur
    when the AI system is being shut down or reloaded. It typically iterates through
    internal storage containers holding AI-related data such as event triggers, action
    parameters, and condition checks, and properly deallocates their resources. The
    method should be called before unloading the SmartAI module or during server shutdown
    to maintain clean memory state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void OnServerShutdown()\n{\n    sSmartAIMgr->UnLoadHelperStores();\n  \
      \  // Other shutdown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the SmartAI manager during
    module unload operations. It's important to ensure no active AI scripts are running
    when this method is called, as it may invalidate references used by those scripts.
  warnings: Calling this method while AI scripts are actively executing can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that all AI processes have been stopped
    before invoking UnLoadHelperStores.
