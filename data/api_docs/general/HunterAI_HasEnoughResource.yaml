  class: HunterAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool HunterAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter has sufficient resources to cast a specified
    spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates if the current hunter AI instance
    possesses adequate resource levels (such as focus, energy, or mana) to successfully
    cast the given spell. This method is typically used within the AI's decision-making
    process to prevent casting spells that would otherwise fail due to insufficient
    resources. It checks against the spell's required resource cost and compares it
    with the hunter's current resource pool. The method considers the specific resource
    type and amount needed by the spell, ensuring that only valid casts are attempted
    based on available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to a spell in the game's database and defines the required
      resource cost.
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has enough resources to cast the specified spell;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (hunterAI->HasEnoughResource(75)) {\n    // Proceed with casting Sinister\
      \ Strike\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(75);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative action\n\
      \    hunterAI->SelectNextAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Validation Before Casting
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 19434; // Aimed Shot\nif (hunterAI->HasEnoughResource(spellToCast))\
      \ {\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(spellToCast);\n} else {\n    // Try to regenerate\
      \ resources or select another ability\n    hunterAI->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal resource tracking and may not account
    for temporary buffs or debuffs that affect resource generation. It should be used
    in conjunction with other AI decision-making logic to ensure optimal spell selection.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed is valid and corresponds to an actual spell
    in the game database, otherwise behavior is undefined. The method does not consider
    cooldowns or other restrictions beyond resource availability.
