  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool CombatEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a combat event has expired based on its internal timer or
    condition.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a CombatEvent object has reached
    its expiration time or condition, making it no longer valid for processing. This
    is typically used in combat systems where events have limited lifespans, such
    as damage over time effects, buffs, debuffs, or temporary combat states. The method
    evaluates the event's internal state and returns true if the event should be considered
    inactive or removed from active processing. It does not modify the event's state
    but simply reports its current expiration status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat event has expired and should no longer be processed,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "if (combatEvent->IsExpired()) {\n    // Remove expired event from active\
      \ combat list\n    RemoveCombatEvent(combatEvent);\n    continue;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Expiration Before Applying Effects
    code: "if (!event->IsExpired()) {\n    // Apply combat effect only if not expired\n\
      \    ApplyDamageOverTime(event);\n} else {\n    // Log or cleanup expired event\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"combat\", \"Combat event {} expired before application\", event->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during combat processing loops,
    so performance should be considered. The expiration logic may depend on game time,
    spell duration, or other temporal conditions depending on the specific implementation
    of CombatEvent.
  warnings: Do not assume that an expired event will automatically be removed from
    all systems - explicit cleanup may still be required in some cases. Also, calling
    this method repeatedly without proper caching can lead to performance overhead
    if used excessively in tight loops.
