  method: CheckConditions
  signature: void VehicleAI::CheckConditions(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates vehicle AI conditions and behaviors based on elapsed time.
  description: The CheckConditions method in VehicleAI is responsible for evaluating
    and updating the state of a vehicle's AI behavior. It processes various conditions
    such as passenger status, vehicle movement, and combat readiness. This method
    is typically called periodically by the game loop to ensure that the vehicle AI
    responds appropriately to changing circumstances. The method uses the provided
    time delta (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last
    update, which is essential for timing-based behaviors like cooldowns or periodic
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last call to this method.
      This value is used to calculate time-based AI behaviors and update timers accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void VehicleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    CheckConditions(diff);\n\
      \    // Additional AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with vehicle movement and passenger handling
    code: "void VehicleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!HasPassengers())\n \
      \   {\n        // Handle empty vehicle logic\n        return;\n    }\n    \n\
      \    CheckConditions(diff);\n    \n    if (IsInCombat())\n    {\n        //\
      \ Combat-specific AI behavior\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main AI update loop, usually at
    a fixed interval. The diff parameter is crucial for accurate timing of AI behaviors
    and should be passed consistently to maintain proper state transitions. Implementation
    may involve checking passenger counts, vehicle status flags, and combat states.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper context, as it relies
    on internal vehicle state management. Incorrect handling of the diff parameter
    can lead to inconsistent AI behavior or timing issues.
