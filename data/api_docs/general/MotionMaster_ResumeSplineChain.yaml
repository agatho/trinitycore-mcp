  signature: void MotionMaster::ResumeSplineChain(const SplineChainResumeInfo & info)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes a spline-based movement chain for a creature or unit.
  description: The ResumeSplineChain method continues execution of a previously interrupted
    spline-based movement sequence. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    spline chain pausing functionality to allow controlled resumption of pathing operations.
    It requires a valid SplineChainResumeInfo structure containing necessary context
    and state information to correctly resume the movement. The method operates on
    the current motion slot and updates internal motion state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: Structure containing resume information including spline chain ID,
      current position, orientation, and timing data required to continue the movement
      sequence from where it was paused.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spline Chain Resume Usage
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      SplineChainResumeInfo resumeInfo;

      resumeInfo.chainId = 12345;

      resumeInfo.position = creature->GetPosition();

      resumeInfo.orientation = creature->GetOrientation();

      resumeInfo.timestamp = getMSTime();

      mm->ResumeSplineChain(resumeInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spline chain was previously paused using a corresponding
    PauseSplineChain operation. The internal state management requires that all motion
    slots are properly maintained and that the resume information is consistent with
    the original chain's parameters.
  warnings: Calling ResumeSplineChain without proper prior pause state or invalid
    resume info may result in undefined behavior or movement glitches. Ensure that
    the chain ID matches a currently paused spline chain to avoid conflicts.
