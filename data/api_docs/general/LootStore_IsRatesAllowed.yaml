  signature: bool LootStore::IsRatesAllowed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether loot rates are enabled for this loot store.
  description: The IsRatesAllowed method checks if the loot store allows rate modifications
    to be applied to item drops. This is typically used in conjunction with loot system
    configurations where certain loot tables may have fixed rates or may be subject
    to server-wide rate multipliers. The method returns true if rate modifications
    are permitted, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    balance in loot distribution systems within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if loot rates are allowed for this store; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Rates Are Allowed Before Applying Multipliers
    code: "LootStore* store = sLootMgr->GetLootStore(\"example_loot_template\");\n\
      if (store && store->IsRatesAllowed()) {\n    // Apply rate multipliers\n   \
      \ float rate = sWorld->getRate(RATE_LOOT_MONEY);\n    // ... process loot with\
      \ rates\n} else {\n    // Use default loot rates\n    // ... process loot without\
      \ rate modifications\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in loot processing routines to determine whether
    to apply server-wide rate multipliers. It's important to note that some loot stores
    may have hardcoded rates and should not be modified by external rate settings.
