  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleNULL(const AuraApplication * param0, uint8 param1,
    bool param2) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles null aura effect application by doing nothing.
  description: The HandleNULL method is a placeholder implementation for aura effects
    that do not require any specific handling. It is typically used for aura types
    or applications where no action needs to be performed when the aura is applied
    or removed. This method serves as a default handler in cases where the actual
    effect logic is either unimplemented or irrelevant. The method accepts standard
    aura application parameters but ignores them, making it a no-op function within
    the aura system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter is unused in the null handler.
  - name: param1
    description: Byte value indicating the type of aura application (e.g., apply,
      remove). This parameter is unused in the null handler.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied or removed.
      This parameter is unused in the null handler.
  returns: None. The method returns void and performs no operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura System
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleNULL(const AuraApplication* auraApp, uint8 mode,\
      \ bool apply) const {\n    // No operation performed\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used as a fallback for aura types that are not yet
    implemented or are intentionally left unhandled. It's part of the TrinityCore's
    flexible aura system design, allowing developers to define default behavior for
    specific aura effects without requiring full implementation.
