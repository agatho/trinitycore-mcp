  brief: Player exits combat state and resets combat-related flags
  description: This method is called when a player leaves combat mode, typically after
    being in combat for an extended period. It clears all combat-related flags and
    resets the player's combat state, allowing them to perform actions that were previously
    restricted while in combat. The method ensures proper cleanup of combat-related
    data and prevents potential issues with subsequent gameplay mechanics.

  notes: This method is automatically called by the game engine when a player exits
    combat, typically after combat duration exceeds certain thresholds. Implementation
    details include resetting combat flags and clearing combat-related data structures.
  warnings: Improper handling of combat state can lead to gameplay issues such as
    inability to perform actions or incorrect behavior during combat transitions
