documentation:
  brief: Returns the player object that owns this spell history instance.
  description: The GetPlayerOwner method retrieves a pointer to the Player object
    associated with the SpellHistory instance. This method is typically used within
    the context of spell cooldown management and tracking, where each player has their
    own SpellHistory object to manage their individual spell cooldowns and recast
    delays. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the owning player object
    remains alive in memory. If the player has been removed from the world or is no
    longer valid, this method may return a null pointer or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object that owns this SpellHistory instance. Returns
    nullptr if the owner is invalid or has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellHistory* spellHistory = player->GetSpellHistory();\nPlayer* owner\
      \ = spellHistory->GetPlayerOwner();\nif (owner)\n{\n    // Use the owner player\
      \ object\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell history owner: %s\", owner->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Management
    code: "void CheckSpellCooldown(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    SpellHistory*\
      \ spellHistory = player->GetSpellHistory();\n    Player* owner = spellHistory->GetPlayerOwner();\n\
      \    if (owner && owner->HasSpellCooldown(spellInfo->Id))\n    {\n        //\
      \ Handle cooldown logic\n        SendSpellCooldown(owner, spellInfo);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a cached reference to the player
    object. It does not perform any validation or safety checks beyond returning the
    stored pointer. The SpellHistory instance must be properly initialized and associated
    with a valid player for this method to return meaningful results.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned Player pointer is always valid. Always check
    for null before using the returned value. If the player object has been destroyed
    but the SpellHistory still exists, this method may return an invalid pointer leading
    to undefined behavior.
