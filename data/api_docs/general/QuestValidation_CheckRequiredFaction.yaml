  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckRequiredFaction
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckRequiredFaction(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the required faction requirements for a quest.
  description: The CheckRequiredFaction method evaluates whether a given player has
    the necessary faction standing to accept and complete a specific quest. This validation
    ensures that players cannot access quests that are restricted based on their character's
    faction alignment, which is a core gameplay mechanic in World of Warcraft. The
    method typically checks against the quest's required faction ID and minimum reputation
    level, returning true if the player meets these criteria or false otherwise. This
    function is commonly used during quest acceptance and validation processes within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the faction requirements
      to be validated. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose faction
      standing is being checked against the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's faction standing meets or exceeds the minimum
    required for the quest, false otherwise. In case of invalid input parameters (null
    pointers), behavior is undefined and may result in a crash.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Faction Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CheckRequiredFaction(quest, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot accept the quest due to faction restrictions\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the required faction requirements.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, const Quest* quest) {\n    if\
      \ (!quest || !player) return false;\n    \n    // Check faction requirements\n\
      \    if (!QuestValidation::CheckRequiredFaction(quest, player)) {\n        return\
      \ false;\n    }\n    \n    // Additional checks can be performed here\n    return\
      \ true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal faction and reputation systems of TrinityCore.
    It assumes that both the quest and player objects are properly initialized and
    valid. The method may perform database lookups or cached reputation checks depending
    on the implementation details of the core system.
  warnings: Passing null pointers to either parameter will likely cause a crash or
    undefined behavior. Always validate input parameters before calling this method
    in production code. Be aware that faction requirements might be dynamically modified
    by game events or quests themselves, so results should not be cached indefinitely.
