documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the instance lock is new and has not been previously saved
    to the database.
  description: The IsNew method checks if the InstanceLock object represents a newly
    created lock that has not yet been persisted to the database. This is typically
    used during the lifecycle of an instance lock to determine if it needs to be inserted
    versus updated. The method returns true when the lock is new (i.e., has no valid
    ID assigned or has not been saved), and false when it has already been stored
    in the database. This functionality is crucial for proper database synchronization
    and ensures that instance locks are handled correctly during creation and modification
    operations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the instance lock is new and has not been saved to the
    database, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an InstanceLock is new before saving
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = new InstanceLock(playerGuid, mapId);\nif (lock->IsNew())\
      \ {\n    // This lock has not been saved yet, so we can insert it\n    sInstanceSaveMgr->AddInstanceLock(lock);\n\
      } else {\n    // This lock already exists in the database\n    sInstanceSaveMgr->UpdateInstanceLock(lock);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on internal state tracking within the InstanceLock
    class to determine if it has been persisted. It's important to understand that
    a lock being 'new' does not necessarily mean it's never been used, but rather
    that it hasn't been committed to persistent storage yet.
