  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetSnapshot
  signature: PerformanceSnapshot BotPerformanceMonitor::GetSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Captures and returns a snapshot of current performance metrics from the bot
    performance monitor.
  description: The GetSnapshot method retrieves a complete snapshot of the current
    performance state tracked by the BotPerformanceMonitor. This includes timing data,
    resource usage statistics, and other relevant performance indicators for bots
    within the TrinityCore environment. The returned PerformanceSnapshot object encapsulates
    these metrics at the moment of the call, allowing developers to analyze bot behavior,
    identify bottlenecks, or monitor system load. The method is designed to be non-blocking
    and thread-safe, making it suitable for real-time performance analysis without
    affecting ongoing bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceSnapshot object containing current performance metrics including
    timing data, resource usage, and other relevant statistics collected by the BotPerformanceMonitor.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      PerformanceSnapshot snapshot = monitor.GetSnapshot();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << snapshot.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis Example
    code: "void AnalyzeBotPerformance() {\n    BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\n  \
      \  PerformanceSnapshot initial = monitor.GetSnapshot();\n    // ... perform\
      \ bot operations ...\n    PerformanceSnapshot final = monitor.GetSnapshot();\n\
      \    float duration = final.timestamp - initial.timestamp;\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Operation took \" << duration << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for frequent calls and does not perform heavy computations.
    The snapshot captures data at the exact moment of invocation, so timing between
    multiple calls should be considered when measuring performance deltas.
