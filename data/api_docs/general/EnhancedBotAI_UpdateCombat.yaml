  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: UpdateCombat
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateCombat(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state and behavior of the enhanced bot AI based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The UpdateCombat method is responsible for managing the combat-related
    logic and state updates for an EnhancedBotAI instance. It processes the bot's
    current combat actions, target selection, spell casting, and movement decisions
    based on the time difference (diff) passed since the last update. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure that the bot responds
    appropriately to changing combat conditions in real-time. The method handles core
    combat mechanics such as threat management, ability usage timing, and tactical
    decision-making within the context of World of Warcraft's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last combat update.
      This value is used to determine when abilities should be cast, movement actions
      should be executed, and combat states should be evaluated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCombat Usage
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Example of how UpdateCombat might be called\
      \ in a bot AI update loop\n    if (m_bot->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        m_bot->GetEnhancedBotAI()->UpdateCombat(sWorld->getWorldTickTime());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main AI update loop and
    should not be called directly by external systems. The 'diff' parameter must be
    a positive integer representing milliseconds; otherwise, unexpected behavior may
    occur. Performance considerations include avoiding heavy computations within this
    method to maintain smooth combat responsiveness.
