documentation:
  brief: Sets the specified player flags for the player character.
  description: This method allows developers to set specific player flags that control
    various aspects of player behavior and game mechanics. The PlayerFlagsEx enum
    defines a set of bit flags that determine which features are enabled or disabled
    for the player. This method is typically used during player initialization, character
    creation, or when modifying player state during gameplay. It affects the player's
    ability to perform certain actions, access specific content, or interact with
    game systems.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The PlayerFlagsEx enum value containing the flags to be set for the
      player character. This parameter defines which specific flags are enabled or
      disabled for the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPlayerFlagEx(PlayerFlagsEx::PLAYER_FLAGS_PVP);

      // This enables PvP flag for the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      PlayerFlagsEx flags = PlayerFlagsEx::PLAYER_FLAGS_PVP | PlayerFlagsEx::PLAYER_FLAGS_QUEST;

      player->SetPlayerFlagEx(flags);

      // This enables both PvP and quest flags for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's internal flag state. It should
    be used carefully as it can affect gameplay mechanics, player interactions, and
    game balance. The method is typically called during player initialization or when
    changing player state during gameplay. Performance considerations include avoiding
    frequent flag changes which may cause unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: This method should not be used to set flags that are normally controlled
    by game rules or player behavior. Setting inappropriate flags can lead to game
    balance issues, unexpected behavior, or even client-side crashes. Use this method
    only when necessary and with proper understanding of the flags being set.
