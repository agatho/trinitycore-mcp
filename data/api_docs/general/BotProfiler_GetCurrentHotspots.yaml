  class: BotProfiler
  method: GetCurrentHotspots
  signature: int BotProfiler::GetCurrentHotspots(uint32_t topN)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current top hotspots based on bot activity and player interaction
    data.
  description: The GetCurrentHotspots method returns an integer value representing
    the count of active hotspots in the game world. These hotspots are determined
    by analyzing bot movement patterns, player clustering, and zone activity levels.
    The method processes real-time data to identify areas with high concentration
    of bot or player presence, which can be used for strategic decision-making in
    bot management or world event triggering. This functionality is particularly useful
    for developers working on AI behavior systems or dynamic world content generation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of current hotspots identified
    by the profiler. A value of 0 indicates no active hotspots, while positive integers
    indicate the count of identified hotspots in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int hotspotCount = botProfiler.GetCurrentHotspots(5);\nif (hotspotCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << hotspotCount << \" active hotspots.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal data processing and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. The 'topN' parameter in the signature suggests
    this method might be intended to return only the top N hotspots, but the actual
    implementation appears to return a count rather than the hotspots themselves.
    The profiler may cache results for efficiency.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling could impact
    performance. Ensure that hotspot data is not being queried excessively in tight
    loops or high-frequency update cycles.
