documentation:
  brief: Moves resources from another DB2StorageBase instance to this instance, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for DB2StorageBase transfers all managed
    resources from the source object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other
    resources without performing deep copies. After the move, the source object will
    be left in a valid but unspecified state, meaning it can still be safely destroyed
    or assigned to, but its contents are not guaranteed to be meaningful. In the context
    of TrinityCore's database storage system, this method is crucial for efficient
    resource management when handling large data sets loaded from DB2 files. The operation
    is generally fast and avoids unnecessary copying of potentially large datasets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current DB2StorageBase object after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'DB2StorageBase storage1;

      DB2StorageBase storage2 = std::move(storage1); // Move assignment

      // storage1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'DB2StorageBase storage1, storage2, storage3;

      storage1 = std::move(storage2); // First move

      storage1 = std::move(storage3); // Second move - previous contents of storage1
      are replaced'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should only
    be used with rvalue references. The source object after a move operation must
    not be used in any way that would access its former data, as it may be left in
    an undefined state. This operator is typically generated automatically by the
    compiler for classes that manage resources, but can also be explicitly defined
    for custom behavior.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after performing a move assignment. The moved-from
    object will be in a valid but unspecified state and accessing its contents may
    lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that the DB2StorageBase class properly
    implements move semantics to avoid resource leaks or double-free errors.
