documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MinionInfo object with the provided BossInfo pointer
  description: The MinionInfo constructor initializes a minion information structure
    by associating it with a specific BossInfo object. This method sets up internal
    references and data structures needed to track minion-related information within
    the context of a boss encounter. The initialization process typically involves
    setting up tracking mechanisms for minion spawn states, health status, and interaction
    with the boss entity. This constructor is commonly used during boss encounter
    setup when creating minion management systems for scripted encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: _bossInfo
    description: Pointer to the BossInfo object that this MinionInfo will be associated
      with. Must not be null for proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MinionInfo Initialization
    code: 'BossInfo* boss = new BossInfo();

      MinionInfo minionInfo(boss);

      // minionInfo is now initialized with reference to boss'
    language: cpp
  - title: MinionInfo in Boss Encounter Context
    code: "class BossEncounter\n{\npublic:\n    void SetupMinions()\n    {\n     \
      \   BossInfo* bossInfo = GetBossInfo();\n        MinionInfo* minion = new MinionInfo(bossInfo);\n\
      \        // Configure minion behavior based on boss encounter\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs essential setup for minion tracking within the
    TrinityCore framework. The BossInfo pointer is stored as a member variable and
    used throughout the minion's lifecycle to maintain encounter state consistency.
  warnings: Ensure that the BossInfo pointer passed to this constructor remains valid
    for the lifetime of the MinionInfo object, as dangling pointers will cause undefined
    behavior.
