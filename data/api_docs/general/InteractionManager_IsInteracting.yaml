  signature: bool InteractionManager::IsInteracting(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is currently engaged in an interaction with an
    NPC or object.
  description: The IsInteracting method checks if the specified player character is
    currently involved in an active interaction, such as talking to an NPC, opening
    a chest, or using a game object. This method typically evaluates the player's
    current state and interaction flags to determine if they are in the middle of
    an ongoing interaction sequence. It is commonly used by AI systems and quest logic
    to prevent actions while a player is busy with another activity. The method returns
    true if the player is actively interacting, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being checked for active interaction
      status. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently engaged in an interaction with
    an NPC or game object, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check player interaction state
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsInteracting(player)) {\n    // Player is interacting,\
      \ do not perform other actions\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal bot behavior"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInteracting in AI decision making
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    if (!interactionManager.IsInteracting(player))\
      \ {\n        // Only perform actions when not interacting\n        PerformQuestLogic();\n\
      \        MoveToTarget();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal interaction tracking flags maintained by the
    TrinityCore server. It may not detect interactions that occur outside of the standard
    player interaction system, such as certain scripted events or custom addon-based
    interactions. The check is performed synchronously and should be fast enough for
    regular use in AI update loops.
  warnings: Ensure the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method does not
    account for all possible interaction types - some custom or third-party interactions
    might not be properly detected.
