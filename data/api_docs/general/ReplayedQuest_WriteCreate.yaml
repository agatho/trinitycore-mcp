  class: ReplayedQuest
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ReplayedQuest::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes replayed quest data into a ByteBuffer for network transmission
    to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a ReplayedQuest
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to a specific player client.
    This method is typically used when sending quest replay information from the server
    to a client, ensuring that the client receives all necessary data about the quest's
    current status and metadata. The serialization process includes relevant quest
    identifiers, completion flags, and any associated reward or progress data. It
    requires both an owner (the player who originally completed the quest) and a receiver
    (the player who is receiving the replay data). This method is part of the TrinityCore's
    packet handling system for quest-related communications.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer into which the serialized quest data will be written.
      This buffer is used to construct the network packet containing the quest information.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who originally completed or owns the
      quest. Used to determine quest state and metadata for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the replayed quest
      data. This player's client will interpret and display the quest information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Player who completed the quest

      Player* receiver = ...; // Player receiving the replay

      ReplayedQuest quest;

      quest.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player packet sending system
    code: "void SendReplayQuestToPlayer(ReplayedQuest& quest, Player* receiver)\n\
      {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    Player* owner = quest.GetOwner();\n    quest.WriteCreate(data,\
      \ owner, receiver);\n    receiver->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during packet preparation for network transmission.
    The ByteBuffer must be properly initialized before calling this method. The method
    assumes that the owner and receiver pointers are valid and not null. It may involve
    internal serialization logic that depends on quest state and player context.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver parameters are valid Player objects
    before calling this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause crashes.
    This method should only be called when preparing data for network transmission
    to avoid unnecessary processing overhead.
