  method: ApplyResourceStrategies
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ApplyResourceStrategies(const CombatMetrics
    & metrics)
documentation:
  brief: Applies resource management strategies based on combat metrics to optimize
    AI behavior during encounters.
  description: The ApplyResourceStrategies method evaluates the provided CombatMetrics
    data to determine and apply appropriate resource management behaviors for an AI-controlled
    unit. This includes decisions related to mana, rage, energy, or other resource
    types depending on the current combat situation. The method is typically invoked
    during combat updates to dynamically adjust how the AI utilizes its available
    resources. It may influence actions such as spell selection, ability usage timing,
    and overall tactical decision-making based on resource availability and predicted
    future needs.
  parameters:
  - name: metrics
    description: A constant reference to a CombatMetrics object containing real-time
      combat data including health, resource levels, damage dealt/received, and other
      relevant battle statistics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        CombatMetrics metrics = GetCombatMetrics();\n        adaptiveBehaviorManager.ApplyResourceStrategies(metrics);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Resource Logic
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    CombatMetrics metrics;\n\
      \    metrics.SetHealthPct(me->GetHealthPct());\n    metrics.SetManaPct(me->GetPower(POWER_MANA)\
      \ * 100 / me->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA));\n    adaptiveBehaviorManager.ApplyResourceStrategies(metrics);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI system and should be called regularly
    during combat updates to ensure dynamic behavior adjustment. It relies on accurate
    CombatMetrics input for effective strategy application.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatMetrics object passed contains valid and up-to-date
    data; stale or incorrect metrics may lead to suboptimal AI decisions.
