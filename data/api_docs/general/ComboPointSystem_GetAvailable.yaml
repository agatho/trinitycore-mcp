documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of combo points currently available for the player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current count of combo points
    that a player can spend on abilities. In World of Warcraft's combat system, combo
    points are generated through certain attacks and abilities, and they represent
    the player's readiness to execute powerful finisher moves. This method provides
    access to the internal combo point counter without modifying it. The returned
    value typically ranges from 0 to 5, representing the number of available combo
    points. This is commonly used in conjunction with other combo point-related methods
    to determine valid actions for a player's class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of combo points currently available
    to the player. Valid values range from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates no combo points
    are available and 5 represents the maximum possible combo points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available combo points
    code: "uint32 comboPoints = player->GetComboPointSystem()->GetAvailable();\nif\
      \ (comboPoints > 0)\n{\n    // Player has combo points available for finisher\
      \ abilities\n    // Proceed with combo point consuming action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using combo points in a combat logic check
    code: "ComboPointSystem* comboSystem = player->GetComboPointSystem();\nuint32\
      \ availablePoints = comboSystem->GetAvailable();\nif (availablePoints >= 3)\n\
      {\n    // Execute a high-damage finisher ability\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ FINISHER_SPELL_ID, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Use a regular attack or generate\
      \ more combo points\n    player->CastSpell(target, BASIC_ATTACK_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the internal combo point state. It simply returns
    the current value stored in the ComboPointSystem. The value returned may be affected
    by various game mechanics such as abilities that consume or reset combo points,
    or effects that grant additional combo points. This method is typically called
    during combat decision-making processes to determine what actions are valid based
    on available combo points.
  warnings: Be aware that combo point values can change rapidly during combat due
    to various abilities and game events. If you're using this value for critical
    gameplay decisions, ensure that the state hasn't changed between when you retrieved
    it and when you use it. Also, some classes may have special mechanics that affect
    how combo points are generated or consumed.
