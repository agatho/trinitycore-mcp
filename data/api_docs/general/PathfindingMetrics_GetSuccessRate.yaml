  class: PathfindingMetrics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float PathfindingMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate of pathfinding operations within
    the navigation mesh.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the ratio of successfully computed
    paths to the total number of pathfinding requests made. This metric is crucial
    for evaluating the performance and reliability of the AI pathfinding system in
    TrinityCore. The value represents a floating-point percentage, where 1.0 indicates
    perfect success rate (all paths computed successfully) and 0.0 indicates complete
    failure. The method aggregates internal statistics from the PathfindingMetrics
    class to determine this value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the success rate of pathfinding
    operations, where 1.0 means all requests succeeded and 0.0 means all requests
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingMetrics metrics;

      float successRate = metrics.GetSuccessRate();

      printf("Pathfinding success rate: %.2f%%\n", successRate * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Pathfinding Performance
    code: "void CheckPathfindingPerformance()\n{\n    static PathfindingMetrics metrics;\n\
      \    float rate = metrics.GetSuccessRate();\n    if (rate < 0.95f)\n    {\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Low pathfinding success rate detected: %.2f%%\", rate\
      \ * 100.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
    The success rate may fluctuate based on map complexity, AI behavior, and server
    load. It's recommended to call this method periodically to track trends rather
    than relying on single measurements.
  warnings: The returned value is only meaningful after sufficient pathfinding operations
    have been performed. Early calls may return inaccurate results due to insufficient
    data collection. Additionally, the success rate does not indicate the quality
    of paths, only whether they were computed successfully.
