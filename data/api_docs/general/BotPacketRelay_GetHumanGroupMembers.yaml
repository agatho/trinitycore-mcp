api:
  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: GetHumanGroupMembers
  signature: int BotPacketRelay::GetHumanGroupMembers(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of human players in the same group as the specified
    bot.
  description: The GetHumanGroupMembers method determines how many non-bot players
    are currently in the same group as the provided bot player. This is useful for
    bot behavior logic that needs to know group composition, such as when deciding
    whether to perform certain actions based on group size or when managing bot interactions
    with human players. The method checks the group membership of the bot and counts
    only those members who are not controlled by bots themselves. It returns zero
    if the bot is not in a group or if no human players are present in the group.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose group membership
      is being evaluated. Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will result
      in undefined behavior.
  returns: An integer value representing the count of human players (non-bot players)
    in the same group as the provided bot. Returns zero if the bot is not in a group
    or if there are no human members in the group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Composition
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player\nint humanCount\
      \ = sBotPacketRelay->GetHumanGroupMembers(myBot);\nif (humanCount > 0) {\n \
      \   // Bot is in a group with at least one human player\n    // Perform actions\
      \ that require human presence\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Return Value for Conditional Logic
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint humans = sBotPacketRelay->GetHumanGroupMembers(bot);\n\
      switch (humans) {\n    case 0:\n        // No humans in group, maybe disband\
      \ or leave group\n        break;\n    case 1:\n        // Solo human in group,\
      \ might want to assist them\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Multiple\
      \ humans, can coordinate group activities\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on TrinityCore's internal group management system and
    assumes that the bot player object is properly initialized and part of a valid
    group. The method does not modify any state or perform any side effects beyond
    reading group data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is valid and represents an
    actual bot before calling this method. Also, be aware that group membership can
    change dynamically during gameplay, so repeated calls may return different results.
