documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GroupFormationData class with default values.
  description: The GroupFormationData constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupFormationData class. This method sets up the internal state of the object,
    typically initializing member variables to their default values or null states.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this class likely represents
    data related to how players are positioned within a group formation, such as positioning
    offsets, orientation data, or other spatial attributes used for maintaining group
    cohesion during movement or combat. The constructor ensures that any new GroupFormationData
    object starts with a consistent, valid initial state before being populated with
    specific group formation information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupFormationData instance
    code: 'GroupFormationData formationData;

      // The formationData object is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be populated with group positioning data.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating new group formation objects. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless they are implementing custom group management logic
    or extending the core functionality. The initialization process may involve setting
    default values for positioning, orientation, or other formation-related attributes.
