  class: InterruptUtils
  method: RequiresEmergencyInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptUtils::RequiresEmergencyInterrupt(uint32 spellId, Unit
    * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell requires an emergency interrupt from the caster.
  description: The RequiresEmergencyInterrupt method evaluates if a given spell ID
    from a specified caster unit necessitates an immediate interrupt action. This
    function is typically used in combat scenarios where certain spells or abilities
    must be interrupted before they complete their casting or effect execution. It
    checks against internal spell data and caster state to determine if emergency
    interruption logic should be applied.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being evaluated for emergency
      interrupt requirements. Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's
      spell database.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. This parameter
      represents the caster's state and properties which may influence interrupt behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell requires an emergency interrupt, false
    otherwise. The result depends on spell properties and the caster unit's current
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::RequiresEmergencyInterrupt(12345, playerUnit)) {\n\
      \    // Handle emergency interrupt logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Interrupt Check
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\nif (spellInfo\
      \ && InterruptUtils::RequiresEmergencyInterrupt(spellId, caster)) {\n    //\
      \ Apply emergency interrupt mechanics\n    caster->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell flags and interrupt rules defined
    in the TrinityCore core. It may be used in conjunction with other interrupt-related
    functions to manage combat flow and spell casting behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster parameter is not null before calling this function.
    Incorrect use of invalid spell IDs or units could lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect interrupt decisions.
