documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot packet simulator state based on elapsed time
  description: The Update method processes and simulates packet handling for bot clients
    within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically called from the main game loop
    to advance the internal state of the bot packet simulator, managing packet queues,
    timing, and simulation logic. This method handles the core simulation mechanics
    that allow bots to interact with the game world through simulated network packets.
    The method operates on a time-based delta value to ensure accurate timing of bot
    actions and responses.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n    botPacketSimulator.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop to
    maintain proper bot behavior simulation. The internal state management relies
    on accurate timing information passed through the diff parameter.
