  class: CombatAction
  method: CombatAction
  signature: void CombatAction::CombatAction(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a combat action with the specified name for use in AI behavior.
  description: The CombatAction constructor initializes a new combat action instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI
    system to define and register specific combat behaviors that can be triggered
    during creature or player encounters. The name parameter serves as an identifier
    for the action, allowing the system to distinguish between different combat strategies
    or abilities. This initialization process sets up internal state necessary for
    the action to be executed properly within the game's combat framework.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the combat action. This name is used
      internally by the AI system to reference and execute the specific combat behavior.
      The name should be descriptive and unique within the context of the AI module.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Action Initialization
    code: 'CombatAction action("FireballAttack");

      // Initializes a combat action named ''FireballAttack'' for use in AI logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Combat Actions
    code: 'CombatAction attack1("MeleeStrike");

      CombatAction attack2("SpellCast");

      CombatAction attack3("HealSelf");

      // Creates three distinct combat actions for different AI behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework in TrinityCore and should only be
    called during object initialization or setup phases. The name parameter is case-sensitive
    and must be unique within the scope of the AI module to prevent conflicts.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with empty or null names as it may cause
    undefined behavior in the AI system. Ensure that all combat action names are properly
    validated before initialization to avoid runtime errors.
