  method: Roll
  signature: bool LootStoreItem::Roll(bool rate) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a loot item is rolled based on its chance and rate modifier.
  description: The Roll method evaluates whether a specific loot item should be awarded
    to a player during a loot roll. It takes into account the item's drop chance and
    applies any rate modifiers, such as those from difficulty or expansion settings.
    This method is typically used in the context of group loot systems where multiple
    players may roll for the same item. The result indicates whether the item was
    successfully rolled for, which can affect subsequent loot distribution logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot item was successfully rolled (i.e., the random
    chance check passed), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Roll Check
    code: "LootStoreItem item;\n// Assume item has been initialized with a drop chance\n\
      bool rolled = item.Roll(false);\nif (rolled) {\n    // Item was rolled, proceed\
      \ with loot distribution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Roll with Rate Modifier
    code: "LootStoreItem item;\n// Assume item has been initialized\nbool rolled =\
      \ item.Roll(true);\nif (rolled) {\n    // Item was rolled with rate modifier\
      \ applied\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a random number generator and should be called within
    the context of a loot roll system. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    loot-related methods like RollForLoot or DistributeLoot to manage item assignment
    in group scenarios.
