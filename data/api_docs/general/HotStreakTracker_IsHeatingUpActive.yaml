  class: HotStreakTracker
  method: IsHeatingUpActive
  signature: bool HotStreakTracker::IsHeatingUpActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Heating Up buff is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsHeatingUpActive method determines whether the player has the
    Heating Up buff applied, which is a temporary state that increases the chance
    of critical strikes for certain spells. This method is typically used in spell
    effect calculations and cooldown management systems within the TrinityCore framework.
    The check is performed against the current state of the player's aura application
    and does not account for any pending or future changes to the buff status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Heating Up buff is currently active on the player,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the player meets the conditions required
    for the buff's effects to be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetHotStreakTracker()->IsHeatingUpActive()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ increased critical strike chance\n    spell->SetCriticalStrikeChance(1.5f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Condition Check Before Casting
    code: "if (!player->GetHotStreakTracker()->IsHeatingUpActive()) {\n    // Trigger\
      \ Heating Up buff\n    player->AddAura(HOT_STREAK_AURA_ID, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only reflects the current aura state and does not consider any
    temporary or conditional modifiers that may affect the buff's activation. It is
    recommended to call this method during spell processing or aura application checks
    for accurate results.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method alone for determining spell effectiveness if
    other systems modify critical strike chance dynamically. The method returns a
    cached value and may not reflect real-time changes in game state without proper
    synchronization.
