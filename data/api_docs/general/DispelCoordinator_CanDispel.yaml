  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: CanDispel
  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::CanDispel(const DispellerCapability & dispeller,
    const DebuffTarget & target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a dispeller can successfully dispel a target debuff based
    on compatibility rules.
  description: The CanDispel method evaluates if a given dispeller is capable of removing
    a specific debuff from a target. It checks various conditions such as dispeller
    type, target debuff type, and any applicable restrictions or requirements. This
    method is typically used in spell and effect processing to validate whether a
    dispel action should be allowed. The evaluation considers both the caster's capabilities
    and the nature of the debuff being removed, ensuring game balance and proper mechanics
    are maintained.
  parameters:
  - name: dispeller
    description: Represents the entity attempting to dispel a debuff. This includes
      information about the dispeller's type, level, and any special abilities or
      restrictions that may affect dispel effectiveness.
  - name: target
    description: Represents the target whose debuffs are being evaluated for potential
      removal. Contains data about the debuff type, duration, caster, and other relevant
      properties that determine dispel compatibility.
  returns: Returns true if the dispeller is capable of successfully dispelling the
    target's debuff according to game rules; otherwise returns false.

    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\nDispellerCapability dispeller;\nDebuffTarget\
      \ target;\n\nbool canDispel = coordinator.CanDispel(dispeller, target);\nif\
      \ (canDispel)\n{\n    // Proceed with dispel effect\n    target.RemoveDebuff();\n\
      }"

  - title: Conditional Dispel Logic
    code: "void ApplyDispelLogic(DispelCoordinator& coordinator, const DispellerCapability&\
      \ dispeller, DebuffTarget& target)\n{\n    if (coordinator.CanDispel(dispeller,\
      \ target))\n    {\n        // Perform successful dispel\n        target.ClearDebuff();\n\
      \        SendDispelSuccessMessage();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ failed dispel attempt\n        SendDispelFailedMessage();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core dispel system and should be called before
    any actual dispel operation. It does not perform the dispel itself but only validates
    whether it's allowed. The implementation may involve checking multiple factors
    including spell school, debuff type, caster level, and target resistance.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are properly initialized before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrectly configured dispeller or target
    data can lead to unexpected results in the dispel validation logic.
