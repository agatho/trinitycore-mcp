documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the storage of player pattern data by consolidating and reducing
    memory usage.
  description: The OptimizePatternStorage method is responsible for managing and optimizing
    the internal storage structure of player patterns within the PlayerPatternRecognition
    system. This method ensures that pattern data is stored efficiently, minimizing
    memory overhead and improving access performance. It typically consolidates redundant
    or duplicate pattern entries, reorganizes data structures, and may perform garbage
    collection on unused pattern references. The optimization process is crucial for
    maintaining game performance, especially when dealing with large numbers of player-defined
    patterns or frequent pattern recognition operations. This method should be called
    periodically or after significant pattern modifications to maintain optimal system
    behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRec = player->GetPatternRecognition();\n\
      if (patternRec)\n{\n    patternRec->OptimizePatternStorage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause temporary performance degradation during execution
    as it reorganizes internal data structures. It is recommended to call this method
    during low-activity periods or when the system is not under heavy load. The optimization
    process is typically non-blocking but might temporarily affect pattern recognition
    responsiveness.
  warnings: Calling this method while other threads are actively using pattern recognition
    features may lead to inconsistent results or temporary unavailability of pattern
    data. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
