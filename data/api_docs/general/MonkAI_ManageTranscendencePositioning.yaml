  class: MonkAI
  method: ManageTranscendencePositioning
  signature: void MonkAI::ManageTranscendencePositioning()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the positioning logic for the Monk's Transcendence ability during
    AI execution.
  description: The ManageTranscendencePositioning method handles the strategic placement
    and movement decisions required for a Monk AI to effectively utilize the Transcendence
    ability. This method ensures that the AI character positions itself optimally
    within combat scenarios, considering factors such as enemy proximity, line of
    sight, and optimal casting range. It integrates with the broader MonkAI system
    to maintain tactical positioning while executing the Transcendence ability, which
    typically grants temporary immunity or enhanced defensive capabilities. The method
    is invoked during the AI's decision-making cycle and may influence movement patterns,
    target selection, and overall combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in MonkAI Context
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageTranscendencePositioning();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the MonkAI's update loop and relies
    on internal state tracking for positioning decisions. It may interact with pathfinding
    systems to determine optimal movement paths when repositioning is required.
  warnings: Improper implementation or invocation outside of the AI update cycle could
    lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect positioning logic. Ensure that all related
    AI states are properly initialized before calling this method.
