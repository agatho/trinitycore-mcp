documentation:
  brief: Determines whether loot distribution by specialization is enabled for the
    player bot.
  description: This method checks if the player bot's trade configuration has the
    loot-by-specialization feature enabled. When enabled, the bot will prioritize
    loot distribution based on the player's active specialization, ensuring that items
    are assigned according to role and class-specific needs. This functionality is
    typically used in group scenarios where optimal gear allocation per spec is desired.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the current configuration state
    of this feature.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if loot by specialization is enabled; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Loot-by-Spec is Enabled
    code: "if (playerbot->GetTradeConfig()->IsLootBySpecEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with spec-based loot distribution logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbots\", \"\
      Loot by specialization is enabled for bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal configuration flags stored in the PlayerbotTradeConfig
    class. It may be influenced by settings defined in the TrinityCore configuration
    files or through in-game commands. The implementation should be lightweight as
    it's called frequently during loot evaluation.
