documentation:
  brief: Returns all party member units in the current party
  description: This method retrieves all units that are members of the current player's
    party. It provides access to the party members' unit objects, allowing developers
    to perform operations on each party member. The method is typically used in conjunction
    with other party-related functions to manage party members or perform actions
    on them. This function does not return a value directly but instead fills an integer
    reference with the number of party members found.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Party Member Access
    code: "Unit* unit;\nint numMembers = 0;\nunit->GetPartyMembers(numMembers);\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < numMembers; ++i)\n{\n    // Process each party member\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires the unit to be part of a party or raid group. The function
    may not work properly if the unit is not in a valid party context. Performance
    considerations include avoiding repeated calls during combat situations where
    party members might change frequently.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the unit is actually in a party or
    raid group; otherwise, it may return incorrect results or cause crashes. Care
    must be taken to ensure that the unit is properly initialized before calling this
    function.
