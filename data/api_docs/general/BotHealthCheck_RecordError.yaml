  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: RecordError
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::RecordError(int botGuid, const std::string & errorType)
documentation:
  brief: Records an error for a specific bot with the given error type.
  description: The RecordError method logs an error condition associated with a particular
    bot identified by its GUID. This function is typically used within the TrinityCore
    bot system to track and monitor issues that occur during bot operation, such as
    AI failures, movement problems, or communication errors. The method stores the
    error type string along with the bot's unique identifier for later analysis or
    reporting purposes. It does not return any value but contributes to the overall
    health monitoring and debugging capabilities of the bot system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that encountered the error.
      This is typically a numeric value that uniquely identifies the specific bot
      instance within the game world.
  - name: errorType
    description: A string describing the type or category of error that occurred.
      This should be a meaningful error identifier that helps categorize and diagnose
      issues in the bot system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Recording
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      healthCheck.RecordError(12345, "AI_PATHFINDING_FAILURE");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Movement Error
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      uint32 botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      healthCheck.RecordError(botId, "MOVEMENT_STUCK_IN_PLACE");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal logging systems or data structures
    used for tracking bot health. It may be called from various subsystems within
    the bot AI framework when errors are detected. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if called from multiple threads, though this is not explicitly stated.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to a valid active bot in
    the system; otherwise, the error might not be properly associated with any specific
    bot instance. Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical code
    paths as it may involve logging operations.
