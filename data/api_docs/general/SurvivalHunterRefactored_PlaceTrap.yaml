  method: PlaceTrap
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::PlaceTrap(uint32 param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Places a trap at the specified location with given parameters.
  description: 'The PlaceTrap method is used by Survival Hunters to deploy traps in
    the world. This method handles the placement logic, including validating the trap
    type, checking for valid positioning, and managing the trap''s lifecycle. The
    method takes two parameters: the first specifies the trap type or ID, while the
    second controls additional properties such as trap duration or activation state.
    It is typically called during hunter ability execution or when placing traps manually
    in the game world.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Specifies the trap type or identifier to be placed. Valid values
      correspond to specific trap abilities available to the Survival Hunter class,
      such as Snake Trap, Freezing Trap, or Ice Trap.
  - name: param1
    description: Controls additional properties of the trap, such as duration, activation
      state, or other modifiers. The exact meaning depends on the trap type specified
      in param0 and may include flags or time values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Place a Snake Trap
    code: hunter->PlaceTrap(12345, 30); // Places a Snake Trap with 30-second duration
    language: cpp
  - title: Place a Freezing Trap in Active State
    code: hunter->PlaceTrap(12346, 1); // Places a Freezing Trap in active state (flag
      = 1)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Survival Hunter's core gameplay mechanics and
    interacts with the game's trap system. It assumes that the hunter has sufficient
    resources or cooldowns to place the trap. The method may internally call other
    helper functions to validate placement, create the trap object, and register it
    with the world.
  warnings: Improper usage of parameters can result in invalid trap placement or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that param0 corresponds to a valid trap type and param1 is within
    expected ranges for the given trap. Incorrect parameter values may cause silent
    failures or client-side issues.
