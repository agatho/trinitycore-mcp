documentation:
  brief: Adds an update block to the UpdateData object for network transmission to
    clients.
  description: The AddUpdateBlock method is used to append a new update block to the
    internal list of update data within an UpdateData object. This is typically called
    during the process of preparing updates for players or creatures that need to
    be sent over the network to client instances. Each update block contains information
    about changes to game objects such as position, health, or other attributes that
    are relevant to the client's view of the world. The method does not return any
    value and is generally used in conjunction with other methods like AddObjectUpdate
    or AddOutOfRangeUpdate to build a complete set of updates for a given tick.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Object Update
    code: 'UpdateData data;

      data.AddUpdateBlock();

      // This prepares the data structure for adding object updates to be sent to
      clients.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update system used by TrinityCore's world
    server. It is usually invoked automatically when building update packets, but
    may also be called manually in certain advanced scenarios where custom update
    logic is needed. The actual update data within the block must be populated before
    sending.
