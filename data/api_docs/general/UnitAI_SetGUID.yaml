  class: UnitAI
  method: SetGUID
  signature: void UnitAI::SetGUID(const int & guid, int32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of a unit AI object to the specified value.
  description: The SetGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a UnitAI instance,
    which is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to track and reference specific
    game entities. This method typically updates internal data structures within the
    AI system to associate the provided GUID with the AI behavior context. The second
    parameter 'id' may represent a type or index associated with the GUID, allowing
    for more granular identification of different entity types within the AI system.
    This method is commonly used during initialization or when reassigning AI targets
    or controllers.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) to assign to this UnitAI instance. This
      should be a valid GUID value from the game world, typically representing a specific
      creature, player, or game object.
  - name: id
    description: An additional identifier that may represent the type or index of
      the entity associated with the GUID. This could be used to distinguish between
      different categories of entities within the AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI initialization
    code: "class MyAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize(Unit* unit)\
      \ {\n        SetGUID(unit->GetGUID(), 1);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reassigning GUID during AI behavior change
    code: "void ChangeTarget(UnitAI* ai, Unit* newTarget) {\n    ai->SetGUID(newTarget->GetGUID(),\
      \ 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    AI initialization or when entity ownership changes. It's important to ensure that
    the GUID being set is valid and corresponds to an existing entity in the game
    world to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetGUID with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior within the AI system. Ensure that the GUID parameter refers
    to a legitimate entity before calling this method.
