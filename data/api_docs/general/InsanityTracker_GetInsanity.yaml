  class: InsanityTracker
  method: GetInsanity
  signature: uint32 InsanityTracker::GetInsanity() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current insanity value of the InsanityTracker instance.
  description: The GetInsanity method returns the current insanity value stored within
    the InsanityTracker object. This value typically represents a player's or NPC's
    level of mental instability, often used in game mechanics related to spell effects,
    abilities, or status conditions. The method is read-only and does not modify any
    internal state. It provides a consistent interface for accessing the insanity
    metric across different parts of the TrinityCore codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current insanity level. The specific range
    and meaning depend on the implementation context, but generally indicates how
    much mental instability or corruption is currently affecting the tracked entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 insanity = tracker->GetInsanity();\nif (insanity > 100)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle high insanity state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Logic
    code: "void ApplyInsanityEffect(Unit* target)\n{\n    InsanityTracker* tracker\
      \ = target->GetInsanityTracker();\n    uint32 currentInsanity = tracker->GetInsanity();\n\
      \    \n    if (currentInsanity >= 500)\n    {\n        target->AddAura(SPELL_INSANITY_EFFECT,\
      \ target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object's
    state. It should be safe to call from any thread context where the InsanityTracker
    instance is accessible. The actual implementation details of how insanity values
    are calculated or updated are not part of this method's interface.
  warnings: Ensure that the InsanityTracker instance being called is valid and initialized
    before invoking GetInsanity, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that the returned value may change between calls if other
    methods modify the insanity state.
