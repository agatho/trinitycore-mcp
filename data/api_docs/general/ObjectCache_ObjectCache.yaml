  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ObjectCache class
  description: The ObjectCache constructor initializes a new instance of the ObjectCache
    class, setting up internal data structures for caching game objects. This class
    is typically used to manage and retrieve cached references to WorldObject instances,
    improving performance by avoiding repeated lookups in the world container. The
    cache maintains weak references to objects to prevent memory leaks while still
    allowing quick access to frequently used entities.

  - title: Creating a new ObjectCache instance
    code: 'ObjectCache cache;

      // Initializes a new object cache instance ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ObjectCache class is designed to be thread-safe for read operations,
    but modifications should be protected by appropriate locks. The cache automatically
    handles object lifetime management through weak references, ensuring that cached
    entries are automatically invalidated when the underlying object is destroyed.
