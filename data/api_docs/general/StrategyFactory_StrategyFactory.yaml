documentation:
  brief: Copies the contents of another StrategyFactory instance into this instance.
  description: The StrategyFactory copy constructor initializes a new StrategyFactory
    object by copying all data members from an existing StrategyFactory object. This
    method is typically used when creating a duplicate of an existing strategy factory
    configuration, ensuring that both instances maintain identical state. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this allows for cloning of behavior strategies that
    define how NPCs or players interact with the game world. The copy operation ensures
    deep copying of internal data structures to prevent shared references between
    instances.

  - title: Basic StrategyFactory Copy
    code: 'StrategyFactory original;

      // Configure original strategy...

      StrategyFactory copy = original; // Uses copy constructor

      // copy now contains identical data to original'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation that performs member-wise
    copying. Developers should be aware that if the StrategyFactory contains pointers
    or complex objects, a deep copy implementation may be required to avoid dangling
    references or shared state issues.
