documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents any type of game object.
  description: The IsAnyTypeGameObject method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance
    corresponds to any game object type within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    various types such as doors, buttons, chests, traps, and other interactive world
    objects. The method evaluates the GUID's type field to determine if it falls under
    the GameObject category, returning true if it does and false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in game logic to filter or identify specific object types during
    interaction handling, event processing, or object management routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents any type of game object; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::GameObject>(12345);\nif\
      \ (guid.IsAnyTypeGameObject()) {\n    // Handle GameObject-specific logic\n\
      \    printf(\"This is a game object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In Object Interaction Context
    code: "void HandleObjectInteraction(WorldObject* target) {\n    if (target->GetGUID().IsAnyTypeGameObject())\
      \ {\n        // Process game object interaction\n        target->ToGameObject()->HandleInteraction();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal type representation of ObjectGuid and
    assumes that GameObject types are properly categorized within the HighGuid enumeration.
    The implementation performs a simple type check without requiring additional database
    lookups or complex object validation.
