  class: AuraEffect
  method: GetMiscValue
  signature: int32 AuraEffect::GetMiscValue() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the miscellaneous value associated with the aura effect.
  description: The GetMiscValue method returns the miscellaneous value stored within
    an AuraEffect object. This value is typically used to store additional data that
    complements the aura's main effect, such as spell-specific parameters or modifiers.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this value often corresponds
    to the 'miscvalue' field from the spell database entries and can influence how
    the aura behaves or what it affects. The returned value is an integer that may
    represent different things depending on the aura type and its application.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the miscellaneous value associated with this
    aura effect. This value typically corresponds to a field in the spell database
    and can vary in meaning based on the aura's type and context.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve misc value from an active aura effect
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEff = unit->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, EFFECT_INDEX);\nif\
      \ (auraEff)\n{\n    int32 miscValue = auraEff->GetMiscValue();\n    // Use miscValue\
      \ for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is directly tied to the spell's 'miscvalue' field from
    the database. It should not be modified directly without understanding its impact
    on gameplay mechanics. The method is safe to call on valid AuraEffect pointers.
