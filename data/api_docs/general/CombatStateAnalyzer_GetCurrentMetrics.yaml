  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetCurrentMetrics
  signature: const CombatMetrics & CombatStateAnalyzer::GetCurrentMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current combat metrics for the analyzed combat state.
  description: The GetCurrentMetrics method returns a constant reference to the CombatMetrics
    object that represents the current state of combat statistics and performance
    data. This method provides access to real-time combat information such as damage
    dealt, healing done, time spent in combat, and other relevant metrics. The returned
    CombatMetrics object is immutable and reflects the most up-to-date combat state
    at the time of the call. This method is typically used by combat analysis systems,
    logging modules, or UI components that need to display current combat statistics
    without modifying the underlying data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CombatMetrics object containing the current combat
    statistics and performance data. The returned reference remains valid until the
    CombatStateAnalyzer instance is modified or destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      // ... populate analyzer with combat data ...

      const CombatMetrics& metrics = analyzer.GetCurrentMetrics();

      uint32 damageDealt = metrics.GetTotalDamage();

      uint32 healingDone = metrics.GetTotalHealing();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Log Analysis
    code: "void ProcessCombatReport(CombatStateAnalyzer& analyzer) {\n    const CombatMetrics&\
      \ currentMetrics = analyzer.GetCurrentMetrics();\n    std::cout << \"Damage:\
      \ \" << currentMetrics.GetTotalDamage() \n              << \", Healing: \" <<\
      \ currentMetrics.GetTotalHealing() \n              << \", Duration: \" << currentMetrics.GetCombatDuration()\
      \ << \"ms\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatMetrics reference is read-only and should not be modified.
    The method does not perform any expensive computations; it simply returns a cached
    reference to the current metrics object. This method is thread-safe if the underlying
    CombatStateAnalyzer instance is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the CombatMetrics object returned by this method,
    as it's const and modifying it would result in undefined behavior. Be aware that
    the reference becomes invalid if the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is destroyed
    or reset.
