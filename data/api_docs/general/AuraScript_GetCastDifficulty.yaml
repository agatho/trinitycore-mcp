  class: AuraScript
  method: GetCastDifficulty
  signature: Difficulty AuraScript::GetCastDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the difficulty level associated with the aura's cast context.
  description: The GetCastDifficulty method returns the Difficulty enum value that
    represents the current difficulty setting under which the aura was cast. This
    is typically used in aura scripts to adjust behavior or effects based on the instance
    difficulty (e.g., normal, heroic, mythic). The returned difficulty level corresponds
    to the player's current raid difficulty or dungeon difficulty depending on the
    context of the aura application. This method is particularly useful for creating
    dynamic aura effects that scale appropriately with the challenge level of the
    encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Difficulty enum value indicating the difficulty level at which this aura
    was cast. Possible values include DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL, DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC,
    DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_MYTHIC, etc., depending on the game's difficulty settings and
    context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Script
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* aurEff, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        Difficulty\
      \ diff = GetCastDifficulty();\n        if (diff == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply enhanced effects for heroic difficulty\n  \
      \          SetDuration(120000); // 2 minutes\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an AuraScript context where
    the aura has been applied to a unit. The returned difficulty value reflects the
    difficulty at the time of aura application, not necessarily the current difficulty
    setting of the player's instance.
