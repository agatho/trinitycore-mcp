documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the 8-bit static flags value associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags8 method returns the 8-bit static flags value stored within
    the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder class. These flags typically represent various static
    properties or behaviors of a creature that are defined at spawn time and do not
    change during runtime. The returned integer value is a bitmask where each bit
    corresponds to a specific flag indicating different creature attributes such as
    whether it's a boss, if it has specific AI behaviors, or other static configuration
    settings. This method provides read-only access to the internal flags storage
    without modifying any state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the 8-bit static flags. Each bit in this
    value corresponds to a specific flag that defines static properties of the creature.
    The exact meaning of each bit depends on the game's flag definitions and is typically
    used internally by the TrinityCore engine for behavior determination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\nint flags = flagsHolder.GetFlags8();\n\
      if (flags & 0x01) // Check if first flag is set\n{\n    // Creature has specific\
      \ static property\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specific Flag
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder* creatureFlags = /* obtain from creature */;\n\
      int allFlags = creatureFlags->GetFlags8();\nbool isBoss = (allFlags & 0x10)\
      \ != 0; // Assuming 0x10 represents boss flag\nif (isBoss)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ boss-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on internal storage and is generally
    fast. The returned value should not be modified directly as it's intended to be
    immutable after creature creation. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making
    and behavior scripting where static properties of creatures need to be evaluated.
  warnings: The returned integer value represents a bitmask, so bitwise operations
    should be used to check individual flags rather than direct equality comparisons.
    Be aware that flag meanings may vary between different versions or patches of
    TrinityCore, and hardcoded flag values might not be portable across all builds.
