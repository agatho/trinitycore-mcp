documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of an auction session identified by the given session ID.
  description: The UpdateAuctionSession method is responsible for refreshing or synchronizing
    the state of a specific auction session within the AuctionHouse system. This typically
    involves updating auction item listings, bid statuses, and other relevant data
    associated with the session. The method ensures that the auction house remains
    consistent with current game state and player interactions. It may also handle
    cleanup operations such as removing expired auctions or notifying players of bid
    changes.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the specific auction session to
      be updated. This value is typically generated when a player initiates an auction
      interaction and is used to track their session state throughout the auction
      process.
