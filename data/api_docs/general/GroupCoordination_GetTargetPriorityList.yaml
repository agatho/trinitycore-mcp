  method: GetTargetPriorityList
  signature: int GroupCoordination::GetTargetPriorityList() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority list of targets for group coordination.
  description: The GetTargetPriorityList method returns an integer identifier representing
    the current target priority configuration used by the group coordination system.
    This value determines the order in which targets are processed during group-based
    activities such as raid encounters or coordinated mob hunting. The method does
    not take any parameters and is read-only, returning a constant value that reflects
    the internal state of the group's target prioritization logic. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other group coordination methods to ensure consistent
    targeting behavior across all group members.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current target priority list identifier. The
    specific meaning of this value depends on the internal configuration of the group
    coordination system, but typically corresponds to predefined priority tiers or
    sequences used by the game's AI and group management systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int priorityList = groupCoordination->GetTargetPriorityList();\nif (priorityList\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Process targets according to the retrieved priority list\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Current target priority list: \" << priorityList << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group coordination system and should only be called
    when a valid group context exists. The returned integer value may vary depending
    on the current group composition, encounter type, or other dynamic factors within
    the game world.
