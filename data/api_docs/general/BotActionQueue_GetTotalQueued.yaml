  class: BotActionQueue
  method: GetTotalQueued
  signature: uint64 BotActionQueue::GetTotalQueued() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of queued bot actions in the action queue.
  description: The GetTotalQueued method retrieves the cumulative count of all bot
    actions currently waiting in the queue. This value represents the sum of all pending
    actions across all bots managed by the system. The method is typically used to
    monitor queue sizes, debug performance issues, or determine when to process queued
    actions. It provides a snapshot of the current workload in the bot action processing
    system and can be useful for load balancing or identifying bottlenecks in AI execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of queued bot actions across
    all bots in the system. Returns zero if no actions are currently queued.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Bot Queue Size
    code: "uint64 totalQueued = botActionQueue.GetTotalQueued();\nif (totalQueued\
      \ > 1000)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: Bot queue size\
      \ is %llu\", totalQueued);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug AI Processing Load
    code: 'uint64 queued = botActionQueue.GetTotalQueued();

      uint64 processed = botActionQueue.GetProcessedCount();

      sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Bot Queue Status - Queued: %llu, Processed:
      %llu", queued, processed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on the internal queue structure
    and should have minimal performance impact. The returned value is thread-safe
    for reading but may change immediately after the call if other threads are adding
    or removing actions.
  warnings: The returned value represents a snapshot at the time of the call and may
    become outdated quickly in high-throughput scenarios. For real-time monitoring,
    consider using periodic polling with appropriate intervals.
