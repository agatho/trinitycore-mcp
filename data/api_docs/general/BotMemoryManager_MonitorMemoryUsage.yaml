  brief: Monitors and logs memory usage statistics for bot instances within the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  description: The MonitorMemoryUsage method is responsible for tracking and reporting
    memory consumption by bot entities in the World of Warcraft server. This function
    typically collects data about allocated memory, heap usage, and potential memory
    leaks related to bot operations. It may also trigger alerts or logging when memory
    thresholds are exceeded, helping administrators maintain server stability and
    performance. The method is often called periodically as part of automated monitoring
    systems or invoked manually during debugging sessions.

  notes: This method likely performs memory profiling without causing significant
    performance overhead. It may utilize internal TrinityCore memory tracking mechanisms
    or integrate with system-level tools to gather accurate statistics.
