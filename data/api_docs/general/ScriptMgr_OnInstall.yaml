  method: OnInstall
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnInstall(Vehicle * veh)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a vehicle is installed, allowing scripts to perform initialization
    or setup operations.
  description: The OnInstall method is a callback function in the ScriptMgr class
    that is triggered whenever a vehicle object is installed or initialized within
    the game world. This method provides an opportunity for custom scripts to execute
    specific logic when a vehicle becomes active, such as setting up initial states,
    registering events, or modifying vehicle properties. It is typically called during
    the vehicle's construction or activation phase and allows developers to extend
    or modify default vehicle behavior without directly altering core TrinityCore
    code. The method does not return any value and operates on a single Vehicle pointer
    parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: veh
    description: Pointer to the Vehicle object that is being installed. This parameter
      represents the vehicle instance for which the installation callback is invoked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Installation Handler
    code: "class MyVehicleScript : public VehicleScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnInstall(Vehicle*\
      \ veh) override\n    {\n        // Perform custom initialization logic here\n\
      \        if (veh)\n        {\n            // Set initial vehicle state or properties\n\
      \            veh->SetSpeed(5.0f);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the scriptable vehicle system in TrinityCore and should
    be implemented by custom VehicleScript classes. It is called during the vehicle's
    lifecycle when it transitions into an installed state, which typically occurs
    after the vehicle has been created or spawned.
