  class: BotProfiler
  method: ProcessCallStack
  signature: void BotProfiler::ProcessCallStack(const int & callStack, uint64_t duration,
    ProfilingSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a call stack entry with associated duration and profiling session
    data for bot performance analysis.
  description: The ProcessCallStack method is responsible for handling and logging
    call stack information within the BotProfiler system. It takes a call stack identifier,
    execution duration, and a profiling session reference to record performance metrics
    for bot behavior analysis. This method is typically invoked during bot operation
    to track function call durations and identify potential performance bottlenecks
    or optimization opportunities. The method integrates with TrinityCore's profiling
    infrastructure to provide detailed insights into how bots interact with the game
    world and execute their AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: callStack
    description: Reference to an integer identifier representing the call stack entry
      being processed. This typically corresponds to a specific function or operation
      within the bot's execution flow.
  - name: duration
    description: Execution time in microseconds (uint64_t) for the call stack entry.
      This value represents how long a particular function or operation took to complete
      during bot execution.
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to a ProfilingSession object that contains contextual information
      about the current profiling session. This includes session metadata, timing
      data, and other relevant profiling state information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic call stack processing
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      int callStackId = 12345;

      uint64_t executionTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      profiler.ProcessCallStack(callStackId, executionTime, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing multiple call stacks in sequence
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    uint64_t duration = GetRandomDuration();\n\
      \    profiler.ProcessCallStack(i, duration, session);\n}\n// Session now contains\
      \ aggregated profiling data for all processed call stacks"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's bot profiling system and should only
    be called from within the bot execution context. The callStack parameter is expected
    to be a valid identifier that maps to known functions in the bot's codebase. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency operations
    as this may impact overall system performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the ProfilingSession pointer is valid and not null before
    calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The callStack reference
    should correspond to registered profiling entries to maintain accurate data collection.
