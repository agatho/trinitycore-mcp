  class: QuestPickup
  method: DetermineQuestGiverType
  signature: QuestGiverType QuestPickup::DetermineQuestGiverType(uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the type of quest giver based on the provided GUID.
  description: 'The DetermineQuestGiverType method identifies whether a given quest
    giver GUID corresponds to a creature, game object, or player within the World
    of Warcraft TrinityCore environment. This method is essential for quest systems
    to correctly route quest-related interactions and determine appropriate responses
    based on the type of entity initiating the quest. It evaluates the GUID to classify
    the quest giver into one of the predefined types: QuestGiverType::Creature, QuestGiverType::GameObject,
    or QuestGiverType::Player. The method ensures that quest logic properly handles
    different types of quest givers and maintains game consistency in quest progression.'
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity to classify.
      This GUID must correspond to a valid creature, game object, or player within
      the world.
  returns: Returns a QuestGiverType enumeration value indicating the type of quest
    giver. Possible values include QuestGiverType::Creature, QuestGiverType::GameObject,
    or QuestGiverType::Player. If the GUID does not correspond to any known quest
    giver type, the method may return an undefined or default type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine quest giver type
    code: "uint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nQuestGiverType type = questPickup->DetermineQuestGiverType(questGiverGuid);\n\
      if (type == QuestGiverType::Creature)\n{\n    // Handle creature-specific quest\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to conditionally process quest giver interactions
    code: "uint32 questGiverGuid = player->GetQuestGiverGuid();\nQuestGiverType type\
      \ = questPickup->DetermineQuestGiverType(questGiverGuid);\nswitch (type)\n{\n\
      \    case QuestGiverType::Creature:\n        // Process creature quest giver\n\
      \        break;\n    case QuestGiverType::GameObject:\n        // Process game\
      \ object quest giver\n        break;\n    case QuestGiverType::Player:\n   \
      \     // Process player quest giver\n        break;\n    default:\n        //\
      \ Handle unknown type\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal GUID-to-type mapping and assumes that the
    provided GUID is valid. It may perform lookups in the world database or cache
    to determine the entity type, which could impact performance if called frequently
    without caching results.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid parameter is validated before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. If an invalid GUID is passed,
    the result may be unpredictable or cause errors in quest handling logic.
