  brief: Retrieves the heirloom bonus value associated with a specified item ID.
  description: The GetHeirloomBonus method retrieves the bonus value that is applied
    to a specific heirloom item. This value typically represents a stat or effect
    modifier that enhances the item's performance in the game. The method takes an
    item ID as input and returns a uint32 representing the bonus value. It is commonly
    used within the context of managing player collections and item enhancements in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the heirloom bonus for the specified item.
    If the item ID does not correspond to a known heirloom, the method may return
    zero or an undefined value.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Heirloom Bonus for Item
    code: "uint32 bonus = collectionMgr->GetHeirloomBonus(12345);\nif (bonus > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Apply the bonus to player stats or display it\n    printf(\"Heirloom\
      \ bonus: %u\\n\", bonus);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger collection management system that
    tracks item bonuses and enhancements. It may rely on internal data structures
    or databases to map item IDs to their respective heirloom bonuses.
  warnings: Ensure the item ID passed to this method corresponds to an actual heirloom
    in the game database; otherwise, the result may be invalid or misleading.
