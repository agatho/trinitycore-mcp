  signature: GroupRole PlayerbotGroupManager::DetermineOptimalRole(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal role for a player within a group based on class, specialization,
    and current group composition.
  description: The DetermineOptimalRole method evaluates a player's character attributes
    including class, specialization, and current group needs to assign an appropriate
    role such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. This method is typically used in
    player bot systems to dynamically balance group compositions and ensure optimal
    performance during encounters. The determination considers factors like the player's
    current gear, talents, and the existing role distribution within the group. It
    helps maintain balanced team dynamics by assigning roles that maximize the group's
    overall effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a GroupRole enum value indicating the recommended role for the
    player. Possible values include GROUP_ROLE_TANK, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DPS,
    or GROUP_ROLE_NONE if no optimal role can be determined based on current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupRole role = playerbotGroupManager->DetermineOptimalRole(player);\n\
      if (role == GROUP_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Assign tanking responsibilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment with Logging
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nGroupRole optimalRole = playerbotGroupManager->DetermineOptimalRole(player);\n\
      switch (optimalRole)\n{\n    case GROUP_ROLE_TANK:\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %s assigned as tank\", player->GetName().c_str());\n        break;\n\
      \    case GROUP_ROLE_HEALER:\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s assigned as\
      \ healer\", player->GetName().c_str());\n        break;\n    case GROUP_ROLE_DPS:\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player %s assigned as DPS\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        sLog->outString(\"No optimal role determined\
      \ for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in automated player bot systems and may not
    be directly called by regular game mechanics. The role determination algorithm
    considers both static character properties and dynamic group composition data.
    Performance impact is minimal as it only processes necessary character information
    without complex calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player object passed is valid and properly
    initialized. Calling this method with a null or invalid player pointer may result
    in undefined behavior. The role assignment should not be used as the sole determinant
    for actual gameplay decisions without additional validation.
