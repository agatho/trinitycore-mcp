  class: WarriorAI
  method: RecordChargeSuccess
  signature: void WarriorAI::RecordChargeSuccess(::Unit * target, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records a charge attempt's success status for the warrior AI.
  description: The RecordChargeSuccess method logs the outcome of a warrior's charge
    ability execution. This method is typically invoked by the AI system to track
    whether a charge attack against a target was successful or not. It plays a role
    in AI decision-making and behavior patterns, particularly for warrior classes
    that utilize charge mechanics in combat. The method updates internal tracking
    mechanisms within the WarriorAI class to reflect the result of the charge action.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was targeted by the charge attack.
      Must be a valid unit pointer; null pointers are not handled gracefully and may
      cause undefined behavior.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the charge attempt succeeded (true)
      or failed (false). This determines how the AI updates its internal state and
      potentially influences future actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Warrior AI Context
    code: "void SomeWarriorAI::ExecuteCharge()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        bool chargeSuccess = HandleChargeAttack(target);\n\
      \        RecordChargeSuccess(target, chargeSuccess);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal cooldown timers or AI decision trees
    based on the outcome. It should only be called after a charge attempt has been
    completed to ensure accurate tracking of combat behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null target pointer may lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the target is valid before invoking this function.
