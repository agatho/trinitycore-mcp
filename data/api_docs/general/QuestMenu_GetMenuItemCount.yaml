  class: QuestMenu
  method: GetMenuItemCount
  signature: uint8 QuestMenu::GetMenuItemCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of quest menu items available in the current quest menu.
  description: The GetMenuItemCount method retrieves the total count of quest options
    currently displayed in the player's quest menu. This count represents how many
    quests are available for selection or interaction within the current dialogue
    context. The method is typically used by the game's quest system to determine
    how many choices a player has when interacting with an NPC. It returns a uint8
    value which corresponds to the number of menu items, and this value can be zero
    if no quests are available or if the quest menu is empty. This method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of quest menu items currently in
    the quest menu. Returns 0 if there are no quest options available, or a positive
    integer indicating the count of available quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available quests
    code: "void CheckAvailableQuests(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestMenu& questMenu\
      \ = player->GetPlayerMenu();\n    uint8 itemCount = questMenu.GetMenuItemCount();\n\
      \    if (itemCount > 0)\n    {\n        // Process available quests\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Player has %u quest options available.\", itemCount);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"No quest options available.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's quest menu system and should only be
    called when a quest menu is active. The returned count reflects the current state
    of the menu, which may change dynamically during NPC interactions. This method
    is thread-safe as it only reads from existing data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest menu is properly initialized before calling this
    method, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. This method should not be used
    to determine if a specific quest is available; use dedicated quest checking methods
    for that purpose.
