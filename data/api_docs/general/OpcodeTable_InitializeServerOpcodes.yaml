  brief: Initializes the server opcode table with all supported network opcodes and
    their handlers
  description: The InitializeServerOpcodes method sets up the internal opcode table
    used by the TrinityCore server to process incoming client network packets. This
    method is typically called during server startup to register all valid server-to-client
    opcodes and their corresponding handler functions. It ensures that the server
    can correctly interpret and respond to various client requests, including authentication,
    movement, chat, and game action messages. The initialization process involves
    populating lookup tables and establishing mappings between opcode identifiers
    and their respective processing functions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'OpcodeTable opcodeTable;

      opcodeTable.InitializeServerOpcodes();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It's
    typically invoked automatically by the core server startup sequence and shouldn't
    be called manually in most cases. The method performs no thread synchronization,
    so it should be called from a single-threaded context during startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in undefined behavior or
    memory leaks. Do not invoke this method after the server has started processing
    network connections, as it may corrupt internal data structures and cause crashes.
