  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: SaveSystemAnalytics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::SaveSystemAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Saves system performance analytics data collected by the bot performance
    analytics module.
  description: The SaveSystemAnalytics method persists the collected system performance
    metrics and statistics to a persistent storage medium, typically a database or
    file, ensuring that performance data is retained across server restarts and sessions.
    This method is usually invoked periodically or upon specific events such as server
    shutdown or when performance thresholds are exceeded. It aggregates various bot-related
    performance indicators including CPU usage, memory consumption, response times,
    and other system resource metrics to provide insights into the overall health
    and efficiency of the bot subsystem within the TrinityCore environment.

  notes: This method should be called in a thread-safe manner, as it may interact
    with shared system resources. Depending on implementation, it might block the
    calling thread while writing to persistent storage.
