  method: HandleQuestGreeting
  signature: void QuestPickup::HandleQuestGreeting(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the greeting interaction when a player interacts with a quest giver
    NPC in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleQuestGreeting method is responsible for managing the initial
    interaction between a player and a quest giver NPC. When a player clicks on a
    quest giver, this method is invoked to display the appropriate quest greeting
    dialog or message. It typically checks if the player has any available quests
    from the NPC, evaluates quest conditions, and prepares the necessary UI elements
    for quest acceptance or progression. This method plays a crucial role in the questing
    system's user interface and game flow mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player
      character.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC that the player
      is interacting with.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void ExampleUsage(Player* player, uint32 npcGuid)\n{\n    QuestPickup questPickup;\n\
      \    questPickup.HandleQuestGreeting(player, npcGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player interacts with a quest giver. Developers should ensure that proper quest
    conditions are checked before calling this method directly. The method may trigger
    additional internal callbacks for quest state updates.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper validation of player and
    NPC states may lead to unexpected behavior or client-side UI glitches. Ensure
    the quest giver GUID corresponds to a valid NPC in the world.
