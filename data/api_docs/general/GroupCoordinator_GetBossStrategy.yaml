  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetBossStrategy
  signature: BossStrategy * GroupCoordinator::GetBossStrategy(uint32 bossEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the boss strategy associated with a specific boss entry ID for
    group coordination.
  description: The GetBossStrategy method fetches the appropriate BossStrategy object
    that defines how a group should handle encounters with a particular boss. This
    is used internally by the GroupCoordinator to determine encounter behavior, such
    as positioning, mechanics, and phase management during raid encounters. The method
    looks up the strategy based on the provided boss entry ID, which corresponds to
    the creature template entry of the boss in the game database. If no specific strategy
    exists for the given boss, it may return a default or fallback strategy depending
    on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: bossEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the boss creature for which to
      retrieve the strategy. This corresponds to the entry field in the creature_template
      table in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: A pointer to the BossStrategy object associated with the specified boss
    entry. Returns nullptr if no strategy is found for the given boss entry ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use a boss strategy
    code: "uint32 bossId = 12345;\nBossStrategy* strategy = groupCoordinator->GetBossStrategy(bossId);\n\
      if (strategy)\n{\n    // Use the strategy for encounter handling\n    strategy->OnEncounterStart();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a boss strategy exists before using it
    code: "uint32 bossEntry = 54321;\nBossStrategy* strategy = groupCoordinator->GetBossStrategy(bossEntry);\n\
      if (strategy != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with encounter logic\n    strategy->ExecutePhase(0);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Fallback behavior when no specific strategy exists\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"No boss strategy found for entry {}\", bossEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during raid encounter initialization and may
    be called multiple times per encounter. It's important to note that the returned
    BossStrategy pointer should not be deleted or modified directly, as it's managed
    by the GroupCoordinator. The method assumes valid boss entry IDs are passed; invalid
    entries might result in a null return value.
  warnings: Do not assume that all boss entries have defined strategies. Always check
    for a null return value before using the returned BossStrategy object to avoid
    crashes. Additionally, since this is part of a coordination system, ensure thread
    safety if used from multiple contexts.
