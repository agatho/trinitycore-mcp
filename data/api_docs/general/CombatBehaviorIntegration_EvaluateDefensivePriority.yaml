  method: EvaluateDefensivePriority
  signature: ActionUrgency CombatBehaviorIntegration::EvaluateDefensivePriority()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the urgency level of defensive actions for the current
    combat state.
  description: The EvaluateDefensivePriority method assesses the current threat level
    and player conditions to determine how urgently defensive actions should be prioritized.
    This method considers factors such as incoming damage, player health status, and
    available defensive cooldowns to return an ActionUrgency value that indicates
    whether defensive measures are of high, medium, or low priority. The result is
    used by the AI system to make informed decisions about when to activate defensive
    abilities or reposition during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionUrgency enum value indicating the priority level of defensive
    actions. Possible values include HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or NONE depending on current
    combat conditions and player state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "ActionUrgency urgency = combatBehavior->EvaluateDefensivePriority();\n\
      if (urgency == ActionUrgency::HIGH) {\n    // Execute high-priority defensive\
      \ ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, DEFENSIVE_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat decision-making loops and should
    be used in conjunction with other priority evaluation methods for comprehensive
    AI behavior. The implementation may vary based on the specific creature or player
    class being evaluated.
