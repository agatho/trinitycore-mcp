  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: MLPerformanceTracker
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::MLPerformanceTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MLPerformanceTracker class for monitoring
    machine learning performance metrics.
  description: The MLPerformanceTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the performance tracking class used within TrinityCore's machine learning systems.
    This class is designed to monitor and record various performance metrics related
    to AI behavior, decision-making processes, and computational overhead in game
    environments. The constructor sets up internal data structures for tracking execution
    times, resource usage, and other relevant metrics that help developers optimize
    ML algorithms within the game engine. It prepares the tracker for subsequent measurements
    without requiring additional setup or configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now ready to monitor ML performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    It simply sets up the basic tracking infrastructure. Performance monitoring should
    be explicitly started using dedicated methods after construction.
