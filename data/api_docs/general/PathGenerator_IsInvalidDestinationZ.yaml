documentation:
  brief: Checks if the destination Z-coordinate is invalid for pathfinding.
  description: The IsInvalidDestinationZ method determines whether the Z-coordinate
    (vertical position) of a target destination is considered invalid for pathfinding
    purposes. This check is typically performed to ensure that the AI or movement
    system does not attempt to navigate to positions that are physically impossible
    or outside valid boundaries. The method evaluates the target's Z-coordinate against
    internal validation rules, which may include checking for terrain validity, height
    limits, or other game-specific constraints. This is particularly important in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment where accurate pathfinding is crucial
    for NPC behavior and player movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the destination Z-coordinate is invalid for pathfinding;
    otherwise returns false. An invalid Z-coordinate might indicate that the target
    is unreachable due to terrain, height restrictions, or other environmental factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (pathGenerator->IsInvalidDestinationZ(target)) {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ destination\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with pathfinding"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with movement logic
    code: "bool isValid = !pathGenerator->IsInvalidDestinationZ(unit);\nif (!isValid)\
      \ {\n    // Log invalid destination\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid Z-coordinate\
      \ for unit %u\", unit->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    return false;\n}\n// Continue\
      \ with normal movement logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the pathfinding system and should be called before
    attempting to generate a path to a target. It's designed to prevent unnecessary
    computation on invalid targets, improving performance. The implementation likely
    checks against height maps, collision data, or other environmental constraints
    specific to the TrinityCore engine.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a standalone validation for all movement decisions.
    It should be used in conjunction with other pathfinding checks. Incorrectly relying
    solely on this check may lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with complex
    terrain or custom map modifications.
