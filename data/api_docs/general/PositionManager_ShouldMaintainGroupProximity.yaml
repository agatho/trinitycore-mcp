  method: ShouldMaintainGroupProximity
  signature: bool PositionManager::ShouldMaintainGroupProximity()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group should maintain proximity to each other.
  description: The ShouldMaintainGroupProximity method evaluates whether the current
    group configuration requires members to remain within a specified proximity distance
    of one another. This is typically used in scenarios where group coordination,
    such as during combat or questing, necessitates that players stay close together.
    The method checks internal group state and game rules to determine if proximity
    maintenance is active. It returns true when proximity constraints are enforced,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group should maintain proximity; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group Proximity is Maintained
    code: "if (positionManager.ShouldMaintainGroupProximity()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ that require group members to stay close\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"Group proximity\
      \ is enforced.\");\n} else {\n    // Allow group members to spread out\n   \
      \ LOG_DEBUG(\"Group proximity is not enforced.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be influenced by game settings, player roles (tank, healer,
    damage dealer), and current zone mechanics. It's commonly used in AI decision-making
    for group behavior.
