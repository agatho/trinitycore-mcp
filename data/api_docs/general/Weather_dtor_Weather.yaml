documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Weather object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The Weather destructor is automatically called when a Weather object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of any allocated
    memory, network connections, or game state associated with the weather system.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method handles
    the removal of weather effects from players and the server's internal weather
    management system. The destructor performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent
    memory leaks and maintain stable server performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Weather object
    code: 'Weather* weather = new Weather();

      // ... use weather object ...

      delete weather; // Weather destructor is called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scope-based destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    Weather localWeather;\n    // ... use localWeather\
      \ ...\n} // Weather destructor automatically called when localWeather goes out\
      \ of scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Weather destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object
    cleanup. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destructor ensures that weather effects
    are properly removed from players and that any server-side resources are freed.
  warnings: Do not explicitly call the Weather destructor in normal code flow as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. The destructor should only be invoked by the
    C++ runtime during object destruction. Avoid double-deleting Weather objects or
    using deleted objects afterward.
