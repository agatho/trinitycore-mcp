documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell immunity mask value for a unit's other spell immunities.
  description: This method retrieves the spell immunity mask that represents the set
    of spell immunities for a unit, excluding those related to specific spell effects
    like damage or healing. It is used in the context of World of Warcraft's spell
    mechanics to determine which spells a unit cannot be affected by, such as through
    aura effects or other game mechanics. The method returns an integer representing
    the bitmask of all applicable spell immunities, allowing developers to check for
    specific immunity types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the spell immunity mask, where each bit
    corresponds to a specific spell immunity type. A value of 0 indicates no immunity,
    while non-zero values indicate various immunity states based on the bitmask.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int immunityMask = unit->GetSpellOtherImmunityMask();\nif (immunityMask\
      \ & SPELL_IMMUNITY_SpellEffect) {\n    // Handle spell effect immunity\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell immunity-related
    methods to determine overall immunity status for a unit. It may be called during
    spell processing or aura application logic, and should be used carefully as it
    affects how spells interact with the unit.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting the returned bitmask, as different
    bits represent different types of immunities (e.g., damage, healing, crowd control).
    Incorrect interpretation can lead to incorrect spell application behavior.
