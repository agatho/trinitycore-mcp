  method: AbortStartup
  signature: void StartupSpawnOrchestrator::AbortStartup()
documentation:
  brief: Aborts the startup spawn process, canceling any pending creature or game
    object spawns.
  description: The AbortStartup method is used to halt the initialization and spawning
    of creatures and game objects that are scheduled during the server's startup phase.
    This method ensures that no further spawns occur once invoked, effectively stopping
    the startup spawn orchestrator from continuing its execution. It is typically
    called when the server needs to shut down or when an error condition occurs during
    startup that prevents normal spawn operations from proceeding. The method does
    not return any value and performs no cleanup of already spawned entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Shutdown
    code: "void HandleServerShutdown()\n{\n    sStartupSpawnOrchestrator->AbortStartup();\n\
      \    // Proceed with shutdown sequence\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the server startup phase or when
    it is safe to interrupt spawn operations. Calling this method after the startup
    process has completed may have unintended consequences.
