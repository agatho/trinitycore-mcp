documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell container bounds for a specified game object entry used
    in smart AI summoning.
  description: The GetSummonGameObjectSpellContainerBounds method retrieves the cached
    spell container bounds associated with a specific game object entry within the
    SmartAI system. This is typically used to determine valid spell ranges or constraints
    when a creature attempts to summon a game object via SmartAI scripts. The method
    accesses an internal cache structure that maps game object entries to their respective
    spell container bounds, which are defined in the SmartAI configuration data. It's
    important to note that this method does not perform any dynamic lookup or calculation;
    it simply returns precomputed bounds from the cache for the given game object
    entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CacheSpellContainerBounds object representing the spell container bounds
    associated with the specified game object entry. If no bounds are found for the
    provided entry, an empty or default-initialized CacheSpellContainerBounds is returned,
    indicating that no specific constraints apply to summoning spells for this game
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bounds for a specific game object entry
    code: "uint32 gameObjectEntry = 12345;\nCacheSpellContainerBounds bounds = sSmartAIMgr->GetSummonGameObjectSpellContainerBounds(gameObjectEntry);\n\
      if (bounds.IsValid())\n{\n    // Use the bounds to validate summoning spell\
      \ parameters\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"smartai\", \"Found valid bounds for game object\
      \ {}\", gameObjectEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-existing caching of spell container bounds during
    server initialization or data loading phases. The returned CacheSpellContainerBounds
    structure should be checked for validity before use, as invalid entries may return
    empty containers. Performance is optimized through internal caching, making repeated
    calls with the same entry efficient.
  warnings: Ensure that the game object entry passed to this method corresponds to
    an actual registered game object in the server's database. Using invalid or non-existent
    entries may result in undefined behavior or empty bounds being returned without
    error.
