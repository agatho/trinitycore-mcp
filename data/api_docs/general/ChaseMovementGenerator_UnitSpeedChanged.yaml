  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::UnitSpeedChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the chase movement generator when the unit's speed changes.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is invoked when a unit's movement speed
    is modified, allowing the ChaseMovementGenerator to adjust its behavior accordingly.
    This method ensures that the chasing unit maintains appropriate distance and timing
    based on the updated speed parameters. It typically recalculates movement parameters
    such as follow distance, speed ratios, or pathfinding calculations to maintain
    realistic pursuit mechanics. The method is part of the AI movement system in TrinityCore
    and is automatically called by the game engine when speed changes occur.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_chaseGenerator)\n      \
      \  m_chaseGenerator->UnitSpeedChanged();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    when speed changes occur. Developers should not need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom movement logic. The method may trigger recalculations of movement
    paths and distances based on updated speed values.
