  class: MonkAI
  method: ManageResourceGeneration
  signature: void MonkAI::ManageResourceGeneration(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages the generation and allocation of resource points for a Monk AI character
    during combat.
  description: The ManageResourceGeneration method controls how a Monk AI character
    accumulates and utilizes its resource system, typically related to energy or chi-based
    mechanics in World of Warcraft. This method evaluates the current state of the
    AI's resources and determines whether to generate new resource points based on
    various conditions such as combat actions, cooldowns, or passive abilities. It
    ensures that the Monk AI maintains an appropriate resource balance for optimal
    performance during encounters. The method operates within the context of the Monk's
    class-specific gameplay loop and integrates with other AI behaviors to maintain
    effective resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target enemy or object that
      the Monk AI is engaging. This parameter influences how resource generation is
      calculated based on combat interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Management Call
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      MonkAI ai;

      ai.ManageResourceGeneration(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::Update()\n{\n    int targetId = GetTargetId();\n    ManageResourceGeneration(&targetId);\n\
      \    // Additional AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and may be influenced
    by the Monk's current class abilities, gear, and talent specialization. It's important
    to ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the target pointer can lead to memory access violations
    or unexpected resource generation patterns. Always validate that the target exists
    and is in a valid state before passing it to this method.
