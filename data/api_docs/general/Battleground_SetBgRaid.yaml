  class: Battleground
  method: SetBgRaid
  signature: void Battleground::SetBgRaid(int team, Group * bg_raid)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a group to the battleground raid for the specified team.
  description: The SetBgRaid method assigns a Group object to represent the battleground
    raid for a specific team within the battleground. This method is typically used
    during battleground initialization or team assignment to associate player groups
    with their respective factional teams (Alliance or Horde). The method directly
    modifies internal battleground state by linking the provided group to the specified
    team's raid structure, which affects how players are organized and managed during
    battleground events. It is important to note that this method should only be called
    when the battleground is in a state where team assignments are valid, typically
    during setup phases.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to assign the raid group. Valid values
      are 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde.
  - name: bg_raid
    description: Pointer to the Group object that represents the battleground raid
      for the specified team. Must not be null when called.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Group to Alliance Team
    code: 'Group* allianceRaid = new Group();

      Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(123);

      bg->SetBgRaid(0, allianceRaid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning a Player Group to Horde Team
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Group* hordeGroup = player->GetGroup();

      Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(456);

      bg->SetBgRaid(1, hordeGroup);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates internal battleground state and should not
    be called outside of appropriate initialization or team assignment contexts. The
    Group object passed must be valid and properly initialized before being assigned
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for bg_raid parameter may result in crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is properly formed and contains valid
    players before calling this method.
