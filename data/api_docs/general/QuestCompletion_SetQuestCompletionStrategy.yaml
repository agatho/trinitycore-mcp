  class: QuestCompletion
  method: SetQuestCompletionStrategy
  signature: void QuestCompletion::SetQuestCompletionStrategy(uint32 botGuid, QuestCompletionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest completion strategy for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The SetQuestCompletionStrategy method configures how a bot should handle
    quest completion based on the provided strategy. This method allows developers
    to define different behaviors for quest handling, such as automatic quest acceptance,
    turn-in, or skipping. The strategy parameter determines the specific approach
    the bot will take when processing quests. This is particularly useful in automated
    questing systems where different strategies might be needed depending on the bot's
    role or the current game state.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the quest completion
      strategy is being set. This value must correspond to a valid bot in the system.
  - name: strategy
    description: The quest completion strategy to apply to the specified bot. This
      parameter defines how the bot should process quests, such as accepting, turning
      in, or skipping them.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Quest Completion Strategy
    code: 'QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.SetQuestCompletionStrategy(12345, QuestCompletionStrategy::ACCEPT_AND_TURN_IN);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with bot AI systems to customize
    how automated players handle quests. The strategy parameter should be carefully
    chosen based on the desired behavior and game context.
