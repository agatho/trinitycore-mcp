  class: PathOptimizer
  method: OptimizeForMovementType
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::OptimizeForMovementType(MovementPath & path, MovementGeneratorType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes a movement path for a specific movement type.
  description: The OptimizeForMovementType method modifies a given MovementPath to
    improve efficiency or correctness based on the specified MovementGeneratorType.
    This optimization ensures that the path adheres to the movement behavior expected
    by the game's movement system, such as adjusting waypoints for flying, swimming,
    or walking mechanics. The method may alter the path in-place and returns true
    if the optimization was successful, false otherwise. It is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore movement system to prepare paths before they are executed by
    units.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to the MovementPath object that will be optimized in-place.
  - name: type
    description: The MovementGeneratorType that determines how the path should be
      optimized. Valid values include types like MOVEMENTgenerator_TYPE_WALK, MOVEMENTgenerator_TYPE_FLY,
      etc., which define movement behavior such as ground-based walking or flight
      paths.
  returns: True if the path was successfully optimized for the given movement type;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Optimization
    code: "MovementPath path;\n// Assume path is populated with waypoints\nbool success\
      \ = optimizer.OptimizeForMovementType(path, MOVEMENTgenerator_TYPE_FLY);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    // Path is now optimized for flying movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing Multiple Paths
    code: "std::vector<MovementPath> paths;\n// Populate vector with various paths\n\
      for (auto& p : paths) {\n    optimizer.OptimizeForMovementType(p, MOVEMENTgenerator_TYPE_WALK);\n\
      }\n// All paths are now optimized for walking movement"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input path in-place and should only be called when
    the path is ready to be used for actual movement execution. It may perform operations
    like removing redundant waypoints, adjusting height values, or reordering points
    depending on the movement type.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid MovementGeneratorType may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect path optimization. Ensure that the path contains
    valid waypoints before calling this function.
