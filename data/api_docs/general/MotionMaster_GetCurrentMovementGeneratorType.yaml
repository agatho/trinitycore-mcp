  class: MotionMaster
  method: GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType
  signature: MovementGeneratorType MotionMaster::GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType(MovementSlot
    slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the type of movement generator currently active for the specified
    movement slot.
  description: This method retrieves the current movement generator type assigned
    to a specific movement slot within the MotionMaster class. It provides insight
    into what kind of movement behavior is currently controlling the creature or player's
    movement. The method is essential for understanding the active movement state
    and can be used to determine if a creature is following a path, patrolling, or
    performing other specific movement behaviors. This functionality is crucial for
    game mechanics involving movement control and can help developers identify when
    movement changes occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the MovementGeneratorType enum value representing the type of active
    movement generator for the specified slot. Possible values include MGTYPE_IDLE,
    MGTYPE_WAYPOINT, MGTYPE_PATROL, MGTYPE_CHASE, MGTYPE_FLEE, MGTYPE_FOLLOW, MGTYPE_QUEST,
    MGTYPE_QUEST, and others depending on the current movement state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: MovementGeneratorType type = motionMaster->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType(MovementSlot::MOVEMENT_SLOT_0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to monitor or control creature behavior. It's thread-safe and can be called
    from any thread context.
