  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CheckObjectBlocking
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckObjectBlocking(const int & from, const
    int & to)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an object blocks line of sight between two points.
  description: The CheckObjectBlocking method determines whether a specific object
    in the game world obstructs the line of sight between two given locations. This
    functionality is crucial for various game mechanics such as spell casting, NPC
    vision, and player interaction checks where visibility must be verified. The method
    evaluates the spatial relationship between the source point, target point, and
    any intervening objects to determine if an obstruction exists. It typically uses
    collision detection algorithms to assess whether a direct path between the two
    points is blocked by solid geometry or other blocking entities.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting position coordinate for the line of sight check. This
      represents the origin point from which visibility is being tested.
  - name: to
    description: The ending position coordinate for the line of sight check. This
      represents the target point toward which visibility is being tested.
  returns: Returns true if an object blocks the line of sight between the 'from' and
    'to' coordinates, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that there
    is at least one solid object or entity obstructing the direct path between the
    two points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.CheckObjectBlocking(playerPosition, npcPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Object blocks line of sight\n    SendChatMessage(\"Cannot see the\
      \ NPC.\");\n} else {\n    // Line of sight is clear\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      Can see the NPC.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Casting Visibility Check
    code: "if (spellCaster->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->CheckObjectBlocking(spellCaster->GetPosition(),\
      \ targetPosition)) {\n    // Spell cannot be cast due to obstruction\n    SendCastFailed(SPELL_FAILED_NO_LINE_OF_SIGHT);\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n    CastSpell(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in pathfinding and visibility calculations for
    AI behavior, spell targeting, and player interaction systems. The implementation
    likely involves spatial partitioning techniques or raycasting algorithms to efficiently
    determine obstructions. Performance considerations should be taken into account
    when calling this method frequently during gameplay loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the coordinates passed to this method are valid and within
    the bounds of the current map. Incorrect coordinate values may lead to undefined
    behavior or performance issues. This method does not account for dynamic objects
    that might move between the check and actual use, so it should be used in conjunction
    with real-time updates when necessary.
