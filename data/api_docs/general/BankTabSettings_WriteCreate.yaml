  class: BankTabSettings
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void BankTabSettings::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes bank tab settings data for transmission to a player client during
    creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the bank tab settings into a ByteBuffer
    for transmission to a player's client when the bank tab is being created or initialized.
    This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation, where it prepares the necessary data to inform the client
    about the state and configuration of a specific bank tab. It takes into account
    both the owner of the bank tab and the receiving player, ensuring proper permissions
    and visibility are handled during serialization. The method does not return any
    value but modifies the provided ByteBuffer with serialized data that represents
    the current settings of the bank tab.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized bank tab settings
      will be written. This buffer is used to construct the packet sent to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the bank tab. Used to determine
      ownership permissions and settings that should be included in serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized bank
      tab data. Used to ensure proper access control and visibility settings for the
      receiving player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bank Tab Creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      BankTabSettings settings;

      settings.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client as a packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal serialization system for bank tab data
    in TrinityCore. It should only be called when preparing data for network transmission
    to a player's client. The method assumes that both owner and receiver pointers
    are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided ByteBuffer is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as it will append serialized data without clearing existing content.
    Also, verify that both owner and receiver player objects are valid to prevent
    undefined behavior or crashes.
