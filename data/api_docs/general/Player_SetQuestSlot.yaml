documentation:
  brief: Sets a quest ID in a specific quest slot for the player.
  description: The SetQuestSlot method assigns a quest ID to a specified quest slot
    in the player's quest log. This method is used to update or modify the quest information
    stored in a particular slot, allowing developers to manage quest progress and
    status within the player's quest log. The method operates on the player's quest
    log structure, where each slot corresponds to a specific quest ID. It is commonly
    used during quest completion or when updating quest progress in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) where the quest will be placed. This
      represents the position in the player's quest log array.
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be set in the specified slot.
      This value must correspond to a valid quest ID in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Slot Assignment
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestSlot(0, 12345);

      // Sets quest ID 12345 in slot 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Quest Slot with Different Quest ID
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestSlot(5, 67890);

      // Updates slot 5 with quest ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's quest log array. It should be
    used carefully as it can affect quest progression and completion status. The method
    is typically called during quest completion or when updating quest progress in
    game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to quest progression issues or incorrect
    quest tracking. Care must be taken to ensure that the quest ID corresponds to
    a valid quest in the database, as invalid IDs may cause errors or inconsistencies
    in the player's quest log.
