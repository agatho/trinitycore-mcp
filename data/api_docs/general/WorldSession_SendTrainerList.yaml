  class: WorldSession
  method: SendTrainerList
  signature: void WorldSession::SendTrainerList(Creature * npc, uint32 trainerId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a trainer list packet to the client for the specified NPC and trainer
    ID.
  description: The SendTrainerList method constructs and sends a packet containing
    the training information for a specific NPC (creature) to the player's client.
    This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with a trainer NPC to
    view available skills, spells, or abilities that can be learned. The method uses
    the provided Creature pointer to determine the trainer's type and the trainerId
    parameter to identify which specific training list should be displayed. It handles
    the serialization of trainer data including trainable skills, required items,
    costs, and prerequisite conditions. This functionality is integral to World of
    Warcraft's class and profession training system within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the trainer NPC. Must
      be a valid creature with trainer data attached.
  - name: trainerId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific trainer list to display. Used
      to determine which skills and abilities are available for training.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trainer Interaction
    code: "void Player::OnTrainerInteract(Creature* trainer)\n{\n    if (trainer &&\
      \ trainer->IsTrainer())\n    {\n        SendTrainerList(trainer, trainer->GetCreatureTemplate()->trainer_id);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Custom Trainer List
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCustomTrainerRequest(uint32 trainerId)\n{\n  \
      \  Creature* npc = GetPlayer()->GetMap()->GetCreature(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Unit,\
      \ 12345));\n    if (npc)\n    {\n        SendTrainerList(npc, trainerId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles packet construction and sending. It relies
    on the Creature's trainer data being properly initialized. The method does not
    validate if the player can actually learn the skills - that validation occurs
    in the client-side UI logic. Performance-wise, this method should be called only
    when necessary to avoid unnecessary network traffic.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer is valid and points to a creature with
    trainer data before calling this method. Passing an invalid or null pointer will
    likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. The trainerId must correspond to a
    valid trainer entry in the database, otherwise the client may display empty or
    incorrect training lists.
