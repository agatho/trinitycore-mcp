  class: InterruptManager
  method: RegisterInterruptAttempt
  signature: void InterruptManager::RegisterInterruptAttempt(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interrupt attempt targeting a specific game object or player within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The RegisterInterruptAttempt method is used to log and track interrupt
    events in the game's combat system. This function typically records information
    about which entity attempted to interrupt another, such as when a spell or ability
    was interrupted during casting. The method likely updates internal tracking structures
    or databases that maintain state information for combat analysis, cooldowns, or
    achievement systems. It is part of the InterruptManager class responsible for
    managing interrupt-related game events and their associated data. This function
    does not return any value but modifies internal state to reflect the interrupt
    attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the entity that was targeted
      for interruption. This typically contains information about the caster, target,
      spell ID, and other relevant combat data needed to track the interrupt event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptTarget target;

      target.casterGuid = player->GetGUID();

      target.targetGuid = mob->GetGUID();

      target.spellId = 12345;

      interruptManager.RegisterInterruptAttempt(target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the core combat system when an
    interrupt event occurs. It may be used in conjunction with other interrupt tracking
    methods to maintain consistency in combat logs and state management. The method
    should only be invoked after proper validation of the target data to prevent invalid
    entries.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid or uninitialized InterruptTarget
    objects could lead to corrupted internal tracking data or unexpected behavior
    in combat systems. Ensure all required fields in the InterruptTarget structure
    are properly populated before calling this function.
