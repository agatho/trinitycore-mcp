  class: BotProfiler
  method: ExportToXML
  signature: void BotProfiler::ExportToXML(const ProfilingSession * session, std::ofstream
    & file)
documentation:
  brief: Exports profiling session data to an XML file format for analysis and debugging.
  description: The ExportToXML method serializes profiling session data into an XML
    structure, allowing developers and administrators to analyze bot performance metrics
    in a structured format. This method takes a pointer to a ProfilingSession object
    and writes the serialized data to the provided output file stream. The exported
    XML contains detailed timing information, function call stacks, memory usage statistics,
    and other relevant profiling data that can be used for optimization and debugging
    purposes within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the ProfilingSession object containing the data to be
      exported. Must not be null.
  - name: file
    description: Reference to an std::ofstream object representing the output file
      stream where XML data will be written. The file must be opened in write mode
      before calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic XML Export Usage
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nProfilingSession session;\nstd::ofstream outputFile(\"\
      bot_profile.xml\");\nif (outputFile.is_open()) {\n    profiler.ExportToXML(&session,\
      \ outputFile);\n    outputFile.close();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Export with Error Handling
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nProfilingSession session;\nstd::ofstream outputFile(\"\
      bot_profile.xml\", std::ios::out | std::ios::trunc);\nif (!outputFile.is_open())\
      \ {\n    // Handle file opening error\n    return;\n}\ntry {\n    profiler.ExportToXML(&session,\
      \ outputFile);\n    outputFile.close();\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n\
      \    // Handle export errors\n    std::cerr << \"Export failed: \" << e.what()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the ProfilingSession object has been properly initialized
    and contains valid profiling data. The output file stream should be opened in
    a mode that allows writing (e.g., std::ios::out or std::ios::trunc). XML formatting
    follows standard conventions with proper escaping of special characters.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null session pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the output file stream is properly opened
    and writable before invoking this method. Large profiling sessions may produce
    very large XML files that could impact performance or memory usage.
