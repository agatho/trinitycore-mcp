  class: Quest
  method: GetQuestType
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetQuestType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest type identifier for the current quest.
  description: The GetQuestType method retrieves the specific type of quest represented
    by the current Quest object. This value corresponds to the quest's type as defined
    in the game database, which determines how the quest behaves within the game system.
    The method is commonly used to categorize quests for processing or display purposes,
    such as determining if a quest is a daily, weekly, or world quest. It helps in
    understanding the nature of the quest and its associated mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the quest type identifier. This value
    typically corresponds to predefined quest types like 0 (quest), 1 (daily), 2 (weekly),
    or 3 (world quest) as defined in the database tables.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 questType = quest->GetQuestType();\nif (questType == 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle regular quest\n}\nelse if (questType == 1)\n{\n    // Handle daily\
      \ quest\n}\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the behavior and categorization of quests. It should be noted that
    this value is read from the database and may vary based on how the quest was defined
    in the game data.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining quest completion status
    or for modifying quest behavior directly, as it only returns the type identifier
    without any side effects.
