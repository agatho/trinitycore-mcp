  signature: const MountInfo * MountManager::GetAquaticMount(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the aquatic mount information for a player.
  description: The GetAquaticMount method returns a pointer to the MountInfo structure
    that represents the player's current aquatic mount. This method is typically used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to determine
    which aquatic mount a player currently has available or is using. The method does
    not take any parameters and relies on internal state management to identify the
    appropriate mount information for the calling player context. It is commonly invoked
    during gameplay events such as entering water zones or when checking a player's
    mount capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a MountInfo structure representing the player's aquatic
    mount. Returns nullptr if the player does not have an aquatic mount available
    or if the method fails to retrieve valid mount information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const MountInfo* aquaticMount = mountManager.GetAquaticMount();\nif (aquaticMount\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Player has an aquatic mount\n    printf(\"Player's aquatic\
      \ mount ID: %d\\n\", aquaticMount->ID);\n} else {\n    // No aquatic mount available\n\
      \    printf(\"Player does not have an aquatic mount.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger mount management system and may depend
    on the player's current zone, faction, or other game state variables to determine
    which mount is considered 'aquatic'. The returned MountInfo pointer should not
    be modified directly as it represents read-only data from the server's mount database.
  warnings: The method returns a const pointer, so attempting to modify the returned
    MountInfo structure will result in compilation errors. Ensure proper null checking
    before accessing the returned pointer's members to prevent runtime crashes.
