  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: HandleQuestTurnIn
  signature: void QuestGroupCoordination::HandleQuestTurnIn(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest turn-in for all members of a group.
  description: The HandleQuestTurnIn method is responsible for managing the completion
    and reward distribution of a quest to all players within a specified group. This
    method ensures that each group member who has the required quest objectives fulfilled
    receives appropriate rewards, updates their quest log, and potentially triggers
    follow-up quest events or achievements. It coordinates the quest completion logic
    across multiple players in a group context, making it essential for group-based
    questing mechanics in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      quest rewards. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Turn-In
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questGroupCoordination->HandleQuestTurnIn(playerGroup, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Group Quest Turn-In with Validation
    code: "if (player->GetGroup() && player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n\
      {\n    uint32 questId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345)->GetQuestId();\n    if\
      \ (questId != 0)\n    {\n        questGroupCoordination->HandleQuestTurnIn(player->GetGroup(),\
      \ questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all group members have the necessary quest requirements
    fulfilled. The implementation internally handles synchronization of quest completion
    states, reward distribution, and updates to player quest logs. It is typically
    invoked after individual quest completion checks are performed.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the group exists or contains
    valid players may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that questId corresponds
    to a valid quest before calling to avoid potential errors in quest progression
    handling.
