  method: GetAnalysisMetrics
  signature: AnalysisMetrics LootAnalysis::GetAnalysisMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the analysis metrics for loot distribution within the LootAnalysis
    system.
  description: The GetAnalysisMetrics method returns a structured set of metrics that
    describe the current state and performance of loot distribution analysis. These
    metrics typically include statistical data such as average loot value, distribution
    frequency, item rarity breakdowns, and other relevant quantitative measures used
    to evaluate loot behavior in World of Warcraft instances. The returned AnalysisMetrics
    object encapsulates these values for further processing or display. This method
    is commonly used by developers working on loot optimization tools, raid performance
    analysis, or game balance evaluation systems within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AnalysisMetrics object containing key performance indicators and statistical
    data about loot distribution, including but not limited to average values, frequency
    counts, and rarity distributions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootAnalysis analysis;

      AnalysisMetrics metrics = analysis.GetAnalysisMetrics();

      std::cout << "Average Loot Value: " << metrics.averageLootValue << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Multiple Metrics
    code: "LootAnalysis analysis;\nAnalysisMetrics metrics = analysis.GetAnalysisMetrics();\n\
      \nif (metrics.totalItems > 0) {\n    double rarityPercentage = (metrics.rareItems\
      \ / static_cast<double>(metrics.totalItems)) * 100;\n    std::cout << \"Rare\
      \ Item Percentage: \" << rarityPercentage << \"%\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot analysis sessions or when generating
    reports. The returned metrics may be updated dynamically based on ongoing loot
    events, so repeated calls might yield different results. Ensure that the LootAnalysis
    instance has been properly initialized with relevant loot data before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned AnalysisMetrics object will contain valid
    data if the LootAnalysis instance hasn't processed any loot yet. Always verify
    that meaningful analysis data exists before accessing individual metric fields
    to avoid potential undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
