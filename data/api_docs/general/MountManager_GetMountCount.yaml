documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of mounts known by the specified player
  description: The GetMountCount method retrieves the number of distinct mount entries
    that have been learned or acquired by a given player character. This count typically
    includes all mounts obtainable through quests, achievements, vendor purchases,
    or other in-game mechanics. The method operates on a provided player reference
    and returns an unsigned 32-bit integer representing the total number of known
    mounts for that specific player instance. It is commonly used in UI displays,
    achievement tracking, and mount-related gameplay logic within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the mount count should be
      retrieved. Must not be null or invalid.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of mounts known by the specified
    player. Returns zero if the player is invalid or has no mounts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      uint32 mountCount = sMountMgr->GetMountCount(player);

      TC_LOG_INFO("mount", "Player has %u mounts.", mountCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Mount Availability for UI Display
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nuint32 totalMounts = sMountMgr->GetMountCount(player);\n\
      if (totalMounts > 0)\n{\n    // Enable mount-related UI elements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You have %u mounts available.\", totalMounts);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player object is valid and properly initialized.
    The returned count reflects only mounts that are known to the player, not necessarily
    those currently usable or accessible in all zones. Performance-wise, this operation
    should be relatively lightweight as it typically involves accessing cached data
    structures rather than complex database queries.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed into this method is valid and not
    null; otherwise, behavior is undefined and may lead to crashes or incorrect results.
    The mount count returned does not account for temporary or zone-specific mounts
    unless they are explicitly learned by the character.
