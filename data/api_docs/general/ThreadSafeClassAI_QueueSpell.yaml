  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::QueueSpell(uint32 spellId, float priority, uint32
    conditions)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a spell to be cast with specified priority and conditions for thread-safe
    AI execution.
  description: The QueueSpell method schedules a spell to be executed by the AI system
    at a later time, based on priority and condition checks. This method is designed
    for use in thread-safe AI contexts where spell casting must be coordinated across
    multiple threads. The spell is added to an internal queue and will be processed
    according to its priority level and any specified conditions. This allows for
    more sophisticated AI behavior where spells are cast not just immediately, but
    based on strategic timing and situational awareness.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to queue. Must correspond to a
      valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: priority
    description: A floating-point value indicating the priority level of the queued
      spell. Higher values are processed before lower ones. Negative values may be
      used for low-priority actions.
  - name: conditions
    description: A bitmask or set of flags defining preconditions that must be met
      before the spell can be cast. These conditions typically control when the spell
      is eligible for execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Queueing
    code: ai->QueueSpell(12345, 10.0f, 0); // Queue Fireball with high priority and
      no special conditions
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Queuing
    code: ai->QueueSpell(67890, 5.0f, CONDITION_HEALTH_BELOW_30); // Cast healing
      spell when health is below 30%
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within a thread-safe context, meaning it can be safely
    called from multiple threads without causing race conditions. The internal queue
    management ensures proper ordering and execution of queued spells based on their
    priority levels.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to an actual spell in the database;
    otherwise, the spell will not execute correctly. Be cautious with high-priority
    values as they may cause unexpected behavior if not used carefully.
