documentation:
  brief: Processes all scheduled quest turn-ins for the player
  description: The ProcessScheduledTurnIns method handles the completion and reward
    distribution for all quests that have been marked as ready for turn-in. This method
    is typically invoked during player logout or at specific intervals to ensure quest
    progress is properly saved and rewards are distributed. It iterates through the
    player's scheduled quest turn-ins, validates completion requirements, awards experience,
    items, and reputation as appropriate, and updates the quest status in the database.
    The method ensures that no quest rewards are lost due to server shutdowns or player
    disconnections.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      QuestTurnIn* questTurnIn = player->GetQuestTurnIn();

      questTurnIn->ProcessScheduledTurnIns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's session is stable and
    all quest data is consistent. It performs database operations that may impact
    performance if many quests are scheduled for turn-in simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method while the player is in combat or during critical quest
    events may result in unexpected behavior or reward distribution issues. Ensure
    proper synchronization with other quest-related systems.
