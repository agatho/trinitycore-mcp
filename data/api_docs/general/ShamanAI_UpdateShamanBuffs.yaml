documentation:
  brief: Updates the Shaman's buffs and aura management based on current combat state
    and spell availability.
  description: The UpdateShamanBuffs method is responsible for managing the Shaman
    AI's buff application and aura maintenance during combat. This function evaluates
    the current state of the shaman, including available spells, target conditions,
    and cooldowns, to determine which buffs should be applied or refreshed. It handles
    both self-buffs such as totems and defensive auras, as well as group buffs that
    enhance the performance of nearby allies. The method ensures optimal spell usage
    by prioritizing high-priority buffs and maintaining uptime on key auras while
    respecting cooldown constraints and resource management.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateShamanBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. The
    implementation relies on the shaman's current target, health state, and available
    spell data to make decisions about buff application.
