  class: Unit
  method: PauseMovement
  signature: void Unit::PauseMovement(uint32 timer, uint8 slot, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses the unit's movement for a specified duration, preventing any movement
    until the timer expires.
  description: 'The PauseMovement method temporarily halts a unit''s movement behavior
    for a given time period. It is commonly used in combat scenarios to prevent enemies
    from moving during critical moments like casting spells or applying effects. The
    method accepts three parameters: timer (duration in milliseconds), slot (movement
    slot identifier), and forced (whether to force the pause even if already paused).
    This method is part of the movement control system and can be used to manage unit
    behavior during various game mechanics such as spell casting, combat, or special
    abilities.'
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which movement should be paused.
      This parameter determines how long the unit will remain immobile before automatically
      resuming movement.
  - name: slot
    description: The movement slot identifier that specifies which movement type to
      pause. Typically used to control different movement types like walk, run, or
      swim, with values ranging from 0-3 depending on the implementation.
  - name: forced
    description: When set to true, forces the pause even if the unit was already paused.
      When false, only pauses movement if it wasn't already paused.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();


      // Pause movement for 3 seconds

      target->PauseMovement(3000, 0, true);


      // Resume after timer expires'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: '// Pause movement with specific slot

      Unit* target = GetTarget();


      // Pause movement for 5 seconds with forced flag

      target->PauseMovement(5000, 2, true);


      // This prevents movement during spell casting'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically modifies the unit''s movement
    state flags and may involve internal timers or state machines. Performance considerations
    include potential impact on AI behavior if used excessively. Thread safety is
    generally not an issue since this is a single-threaded operation within a unit''s
    context.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can interfere with normal AI
    behavior and movement patterns. Overuse may lead to unintended consequences in
    combat or movement mechanics. Also, the forced parameter might cause issues if
    used incorrectly with already paused units.
