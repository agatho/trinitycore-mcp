  method: Remove
  signature: void AreaTrigger::Remove()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the area trigger from the world and cleans up its resources.
  description: The Remove method is responsible for safely removing an AreaTrigger
    object from the game world. It typically handles the cleanup of associated resources,
    such as removing the trigger from active triggers lists, notifying the client
    about removal, and ensuring that any pending events or references are properly
    terminated. This method is commonly called when an area trigger's duration expires,
    is manually removed by a spell effect, or when the associated GameObject or Unit
    is destroyed. The method ensures that no dangling references remain in the game
    state after removal.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void SpellEffectRemoveAreaTrigger(Spell* spell)\n{\n    if (AreaTrigger*\
      \ trigger = spell->GetCaster()->GetAreaTriggerById(12345))\n    {\n        trigger->Remove();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Area Trigger on Expiration
    code: "void AreaTrigger::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_timeLeft <= diff)\n\
      \    {\n        Remove(); // Remove the area trigger when time expires\n   \
      \     return;\n    }\n    m_timeLeft -= diff;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly from outside the AreaTrigger's
    internal logic unless you are certain about the consequences. It is typically
    invoked by the core game loop or through spell handlers when an area trigger needs
    to be destroyed. The method may perform asynchronous cleanup operations, so immediate
    access to the object after calling Remove() could result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling Remove() on an already-removed AreaTrigger can lead to memory
    corruption or crashes. Always verify that the area trigger is still valid before
    removal. Additionally, if this method is called from a different thread than where
    the object was created, it may cause race conditions unless proper synchronization
    mechanisms are in place.
