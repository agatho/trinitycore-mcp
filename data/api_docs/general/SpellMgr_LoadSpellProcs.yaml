  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellProcs()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads spell proc event configurations from database into
    memory for active spell processing.
  description: The LoadSpellProcs method is responsible for loading all spell proc
    definitions from the database into internal data structures within the SpellMgr
    class. This method processes entries related to spell procs, which are triggered
    events that occur when certain conditions are met during gameplay such as damage
    dealt, healing received, or specific actions performed by players or creatures.
    These proc configurations define how and when spells should trigger additional
    effects based on game mechanics like critical strikes, periodic triggers, or aura-based
    activations. The method typically runs during server startup or reload operations
    to ensure that all proc-related spell data is available for real-time processing
    during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSpellProcs()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellProcs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or configuration reloads.
    It's critical that this method completes successfully before gameplay begins to
    ensure all proc-based spell effects function correctly. The method may involve
    database queries and memory allocations depending on the number of spell procs
    defined in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal proc tables. It should only be called
    once during initialization or when reloading spell data.
