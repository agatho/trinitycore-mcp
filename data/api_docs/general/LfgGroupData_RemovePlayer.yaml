  class: LfgGroupData
  method: RemovePlayer
  signature: uint8 LfgGroupData::RemovePlayer(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the LFG group data structure by GUID and returns the
    number of remaining players.
  description: The RemovePlayer method removes a specific player identified by their
    global unique identifier (GUID) from the LFG (Looking for Group) group data structure.
    It is used to manage group composition during LFG operations, such as when a player
    leaves a group or is removed due to timeout or other conditions. The method returns
    the count of players that remain in the group after the removal operation. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining accurate group state information within
    the TrinityCore LFG system and ensuring proper group matching and queuing behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from
      the LFG group. This should be a valid player GUID within the context of the
      current LFG group.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of players remaining in the
    group after the specified player has been removed. If the player was not found
    in the group, it typically returns 0 or the original count, depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Removal
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      // Assume groupData contains players with GUIDs 12345, 67890, and 54321

      uint8 remainingPlayers = groupData.RemovePlayer(67890);

      // remainingPlayers now equals 2, as player with GUID 67890 was removed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal data structure that tracks player
    membership in LFG groups. It's important to note that removing a player may affect
    group matchmaking eligibility and should be used carefully during active LFG operations.
    The method is part of the larger LFG system infrastructure and interacts with
    other group management components.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual player
    currently in the group; passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect return values. This method should not be called
    during critical group operations without proper synchronization.
