  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetStatValueOnItem
  signature: float LootAnalysis::GetStatValueOnItem(const LootItem & item, uint32
    statType)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the stat value of a specific item based on its loot
    properties.
  description: The GetStatValueOnItem method retrieves the numerical value of a specified
    stat type from a given loot item. This function is typically used in loot analysis
    systems to evaluate item quality, compare potential stats, or determine the relative
    value of items within a loot context. The method processes the item's properties
    and applies any relevant modifiers or calculations to derive the final stat value.
    It serves as a core utility for evaluating loot efficiency and player progression
    in World of Warcraft environments using TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A constant reference to a LootItem structure that contains the item
      data being analyzed. This includes item properties, stats, and other relevant
      information required for stat calculation.
  - name: statType
    description: A uint32 value representing the specific stat type to be evaluated.
      This typically corresponds to predefined stat identifiers such as agility, strength,
      intellect, stamina, etc., defined within the TrinityCore loot system.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated stat value for the specified
    item and stat type. The returned value may be zero if the item does not possess
    the requested stat or if calculation fails due to invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootItem item;

      // Assume item is populated with valid loot data

      float agilityValue = lootAnalysis.GetStatValueOnItem(item, ITEM_MOD_AGILITY);

      printf("Agility value: %f\n", agilityValue);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stat Evaluation for Loot Analysis
    code: "LootItem item;\nfloat totalValue = 0.0f;\nuint32 statTypes[] = { ITEM_MOD_STRENGTH,\
      \ ITEM_MOD_AGILITY, ITEM_MOD_INTELLECT };\nfor (uint32 stat : statTypes)\n{\n\
      \    float value = lootAnalysis.GetStatValueOnItem(item, stat);\n    totalValue\
      \ += value;\n}\nprintf(\"Total stat value: %f\\n\", totalValue);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LootAnalysis class and assumes that the input
    item has been properly initialized with valid loot data. The statType parameter
    must correspond to a recognized stat identifier within the TrinityCore system.
    Performance may vary depending on how complex the stat calculation logic is for
    different item types.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootItem object passed to this method contains valid and
    populated data; otherwise, unexpected behavior or incorrect results may occur.
    The statType parameter must be a valid identifier from the TrinityCore stat enum
    system to avoid undefined behavior.
