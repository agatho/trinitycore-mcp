  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: SetResponseDelay
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::SetResponseDelay(uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the response delay for group invitations in milliseconds.
  description: The SetResponseDelay method configures the time interval, specified
    in milliseconds, that must pass before a group invitation response is processed.
    This mechanism helps prevent spam and ensures orderly handling of invitation requests
    within the TrinityCore framework. The delay is typically applied to manage client-server
    communication timing and reduce the likelihood of rapid successive invitation
    attempts. This setting affects how quickly players can respond to group invitations
    after they are received.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a 5-second response delay
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.SetResponseDelay(5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable response delay by setting to zero
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.SetResponseDelay(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state used for managing invitation timing.
    It's recommended to call this during initialization or configuration phases rather
    than dynamically during active gameplay to avoid unexpected behavior in invitation
    handling.
  warnings: Setting the delay to zero may lead to rapid successive invitations, which
    could overwhelm the server or client if not properly managed. Ensure appropriate
    delays are set to maintain game stability and player experience.
