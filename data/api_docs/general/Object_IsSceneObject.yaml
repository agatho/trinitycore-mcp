documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a scene object.
  description: This method checks if the current Object instance is a scene object,
    which represents a special type of object used in World of Warcraft's scene system.
    Scene objects are typically used for visual effects and are not standard game
    objects. The method returns true if the object belongs to the scene system, false
    otherwise. This functionality is primarily used for identifying and handling scene-related
    objects within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a scene object, false otherwise. A scene
    object is one that has been specifically designated as part of the scene system
    rather than regular game objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->IsSceneObject()) {\n    // Handle scene object\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Object class and should be used carefully when
    dealing with scene objects. Scene objects are typically created through specific
    methods in the scene system and may have different behaviors than regular objects.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an object is a scene object
    in all contexts, as it only returns true for objects specifically marked as scene
    objects. Be careful when using this method with non-scene objects.
