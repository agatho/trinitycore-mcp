  class: Creature
  method: SetCanHaveLoot
  signature: void Creature::SetCanHaveLoot(bool canHaveLoot)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature can have loot or not.
  description: This method controls the loot availability status of a creature, determining
    whether it can drop items or not. It is commonly used during creature initialization
    or when modifying creature behavior in response to game events. The method affects
    the creature's loot table and can be used to prevent loot from being generated
    for specific creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: canHaveLoot
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should be able to
      have loot. True allows loot generation, false prevents it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetCanHaveLoot(true);

      // Creature now can have loot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting loot status based on game event
    code: "if (gameEvent == EVENT_TYPE_QUEST)\n{\n    creature->SetCanHaveLoot(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    creature->SetCanHaveLoot(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's loot table and is typically used
    in conjunction with other methods that control creature behavior. It should be
    called before the creature is spawned or initialized to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to creatures not dropping loot even
    when they should, potentially affecting quest progression or game balance. This
    method should not be used to prevent loot for creatures that are supposed to drop
    loot.
