  class: Player
  method: SetReputation
  signature: void Player::SetReputation(uint32 factionentry, int32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the reputation value for a specified faction entry for the player.
  description: The SetReputation method allows developers to directly modify a player's
    reputation with a specific faction. This method is commonly used in quest scripts,
    NPC interactions, or custom content to adjust player's standing with various factions.
    It can increase or decrease reputation values, and may trigger reputation-related
    events such as level-up notifications or faction-specific rewards. The method
    operates on the player's current reputation state, allowing for precise control
    over faction relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: factionentry
    description: The faction ID (entry) to modify reputation for. This corresponds
      to the faction's unique identifier in the game database, typically found in
      the faction table.
  - name: value
    description: The new reputation value to set. Positive values increase reputation,
      negative values decrease it, and zero sets the reputation to neutral level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Setting Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetReputation(529, 3000); // Set faction entry 529 to 3000 reputation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Reputation Setting with Negative Values
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetReputation(112, -500); // Set faction entry 112 to negative reputation
      value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's reputation without any checks
    or validations on the input values. It is important to note that setting reputation
    beyond the maximum allowed value may not have visible effects in-game, as reputation
    typically caps at 4299999999 (max faction standing). Additionally, this method
    does not trigger any automatic notifications or updates to the player's UI; developers
    must manually handle such updates if needed.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the faction entry exists in the game
    database. Setting a non-existent faction ID may lead to undefined behavior or
    errors. Also, setting reputation values beyond the maximum allowed value (4299999999)
    will have no effect on the player's actual reputation level.
