    uint32 broadcastTextId) const
documentation:
  brief: Plays a direct sound effect for the specified target player.
  description: This method plays a direct sound effect for a target player, allowing
    the caller to specify a sound ID and optionally a broadcast text ID. It is used
    primarily in World of Warcraft to trigger audio events for specific players or
    groups of players. The sound ID parameter determines which sound file to play,
    while the broadcast text ID can be used to provide additional context or localization
    information. This method does not return any value and is typically used for triggering
    audio effects in game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: soundId
    description: The identifier of the sound to play. This corresponds to a specific
      sound file in the game's audio database.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the target player object for whom the sound is played.
      If NULL, the sound is played for all players in range.
  - name: broadcastTextId
    description: The identifier of the broadcast text associated with the sound. This
      can be used to provide additional localization or context information for the
      sound effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* object = new WorldObject();

      Player* targetPlayer = new Player();

      object->PlayDirectSound(12345, targetPlayer, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* object = new WorldObject();

      object->PlayDirectSound(12345, nullptr, 67890); // Play for all players in range'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented using the TrinityCore's audio system and requires
    proper sound database entries to function correctly. The method may not work properly
    if the sound ID or broadcast text ID is invalid or not found in the game's database.
  warnings: The method should be used carefully as it can cause performance issues
    if overused, especially with large numbers of players. Also, incorrect sound IDs
    or broadcast text IDs can lead to audio errors or missing sounds.
