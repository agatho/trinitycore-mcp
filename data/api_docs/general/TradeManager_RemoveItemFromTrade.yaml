  class: TradeManager
  method: RemoveItemFromTrade
  signature: bool TradeManager::RemoveItemFromTrade(uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from the trade window at the specified slot.
  description: The RemoveItemFromTrade method removes an item from the trade window
    at the given slot index. This function is typically used during the trading process
    when a player wants to untrade an item they previously added. The method validates
    that the slot is within acceptable bounds and that there is actually an item in
    that slot before attempting removal. It updates the internal trade state and may
    send updates to both players involved in the trade. If successful, it returns
    true; otherwise, it returns false.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The index of the slot from which to remove the item. Valid values
      are typically 0-6, corresponding to the player's trade slots (0-5 for items,
      6 for currency).
  returns: True if the item was successfully removed from the specified slot; false
    if the slot is invalid or if there was no item in that slot.
  examples:
  - title: Remove an item from trade slot 2
    code: "if (tradeManager->RemoveItemFromTrade(2)) {\n    // Item successfully removed\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"Item removed from trade.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to remove item\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Failed to remove item from trade.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during an active trade session. It assumes
    that the trade state is properly initialized and that both players are in a valid
    trading state. The slot parameter must be within the valid range for trade slots,
    typically 0-6.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid slot index may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the slot before calling this function. Additionally,
    ensure that the trade session is active and that both players are still in the
    trading state to avoid inconsistent trade states.
