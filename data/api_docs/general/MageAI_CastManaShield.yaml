documentation:
  brief: Casts the Mana Shield spell for the Mage AI.
  description: The CastManaShield method is responsible for activating the Mana Shield
    spell within the Mage AI's behavior system. This spell provides damage absorption
    by converting mana into protective shielding. The method typically checks for
    valid conditions such as spell availability, mana costs, and target eligibility
    before attempting to cast the spell. It integrates with the core TrinityCore AI
    framework to ensure proper execution during combat scenarios.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        CastManaShield();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI has sufficient mana and the
    spell is not on cooldown. The implementation relies on the underlying TrinityCore
    spell system to handle casting mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI unit is in a valid combat state before calling this
    method, as casting outside of combat may result in unexpected behavior or failure
    to execute.
