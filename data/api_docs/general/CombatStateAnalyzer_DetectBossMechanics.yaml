documentation:
  brief: Analyzes combat state to detect and identify boss-specific mechanics during
    encounters.
  description: The DetectBossMechanics method performs a comprehensive analysis of
    the current combat state to identify active boss mechanics. It examines various
    encounter-related flags, spell effects, and combat events to determine which specific
    boss abilities or mechanics are currently in effect. This method is typically
    invoked during boss fight encounters to track mechanic progression and trigger
    appropriate AI behaviors or alerts. The detection process may involve checking
    for active buffs, debuffs, aura states, and other encounter-specific conditions
    that define the current phase or mechanic of the boss fight.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    combatAnalyzer->DetectBossMechanics();\n    // Additional\
      \ combat logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly during boss encounters, typically
    in the AI update loop. It relies on accurate combat state tracking and may require
    synchronization with other combat-related systems. The method does not modify
    any game state directly but rather analyzes existing conditions to inform AI decision-making.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called during active boss encounters to
    avoid unnecessary processing. The detection logic assumes proper initialization
    of combat state data, so calling it before a boss fight begins may produce undefined
    behavior or false positives.
