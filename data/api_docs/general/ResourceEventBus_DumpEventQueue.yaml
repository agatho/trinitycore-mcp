documentation:
  brief: Dumps the contents of the resource event queue to the console or log for
    debugging purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending events in the ResourceEventBus
    queue to the system log or console. This utility function is primarily used during
    development and debugging to inspect the state of queued resource-related events.
    It provides visibility into what events are waiting to be processed, which can
    help identify issues such as event leaks, incorrect ordering, or processing bottlenecks.
    The method does not modify any internal state; it only reads and displays the
    current queue contents. This function is typically disabled in production builds
    for performance reasons.

  notes: This method is intended for debugging only and should not be called in performance-critical
    sections of code. In production environments, this function may be compiled out
    entirely to avoid unnecessary overhead.
