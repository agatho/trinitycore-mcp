documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the rogue bot character based on current combat state and
    available abilities.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buff effects to a rogue bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    evaluates the current combat situation, checks for available buff resources such
    as energy or combo points, and applies relevant passive or active buffs that enhance
    the rogue's performance. It typically integrates with the bot's decision-making
    system to ensure optimal use of available abilities and resources during gameplay.
    The method operates within the context of a baseline rotation strategy designed
    for efficient rogue gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "void RogueBot::Update()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    m_rotation->ApplyBuffs(&m_bot);\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a larger rotation system and should
    be invoked before any combat actions are taken. It assumes that the bot's state
    and resources have already been evaluated by previous methods in the AI sequence.
