  class: MonkAI
  method: ShouldInterruptSpell
  signature: bool MonkAI::ShouldInterruptSpell(int * caster, int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Monk AI should interrupt a spell cast by a given caster.
  description: The ShouldInterruptSpell method evaluates if the Monk AI should interrupt
    an ongoing spell cast by a specified caster. This method is typically used in
    the context of spell interruption logic for Monk class AI behavior, particularly
    when dealing with abilities that can be interrupted such as channeled spells or
    instant casts. The decision to interrupt is based on factors like spell type,
    caster's current state, and the Monk's own tactical situation. It returns true
    if the spell should be interrupted, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the caster object that is casting the spell. This parameter
      represents the entity initiating the spell cast.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell being cast. Used to determine if the
      spell is interruptible and what type of interruption logic should be applied.
  returns: Returns true if the Monk AI should interrupt the spell cast by the given
    caster; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI logic
    code: "if (monkAI->ShouldInterruptSpell(&caster, spellId)) {\n    // Perform interruption\
      \ logic\n    monkAI->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional spell checking
    code: "bool shouldInterrupt = monkAI->ShouldInterruptSpell(&caster, spellId);\n\
      if (shouldInterrupt && caster->IsCasting()) {\n    // Apply interrupt mechanics\n\
      \    monkAI->ApplyInterruptEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI system and likely integrates with TrinityCore's
    spell interruption framework. It may consider factors such as spell school, cast
    time, and the Monk's current stance or abilities when making decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster parameter points to a valid object before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also note that spell IDs must be valid for proper evaluation.
