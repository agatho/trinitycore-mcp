documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InteractionValidator instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The InteractionValidator destructor is responsible for cleaning up
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the validator instance.
    This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the validator object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft server implementation, this destructor likely handles cleanup of validation
    state, cached data, or internal structures used to validate player interactions
    with game objects, NPCs, or other entities. The destructor is automatically invoked
    by the C++ runtime when the object's lifetime ends.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InteractionValidator
    code: "void someFunction()\n{\n    InteractionValidator validator;\n    // ...\
      \ use validator ...\n    // validator is automatically destroyed here when going\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of InteractionValidator
    code: 'InteractionValidator* validator = new InteractionValidator();

      // ... use validator ...

      delete validator; // Triggers the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It should not throw exceptions to maintain exception safety.
    The destruction process typically involves calling base class destructors first,
    followed by member object destructors, and finally releasing any allocated memory.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Avoid deleting objects through base class pointers without
    a virtual destructor, as it can lead to undefined behavior. The destructor should
    be noexcept for performance and safety reasons.
