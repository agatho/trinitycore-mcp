  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: HasCorrectAspect
  signature: bool SurvivalHunterRefactored::HasCorrectAspect() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the survival hunter has the correct aspect applied to their pet.
  description: The HasCorrectAspect method determines whether the hunter's current
    pet has the appropriate aspect buff that matches the hunter's specialization.
    In World of Warcraft's Survival Hunter class, this typically involves checking
    for aspects like 'Aspect of the Hawk' or 'Aspect of the Pack' depending on the
    hunter's current stance and gameplay strategy. This method is crucial for ensuring
    proper pet behavior and maintaining optimal combat effectiveness during hunting
    scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter's pet has the correct aspect applied, false
    otherwise. The method evaluates the active aspect buff on the pet against the
    expected aspect based on the hunter's current specialization and gameplay state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (hunter->HasCorrectAspect()) {\n    // Pet has correct aspect, proceed\
      \ with normal hunting behavior\n    DoNormalHunting();\n} else {\n    // Apply\
      \ correct aspect to pet\n    hunter->ApplyCorrectAspect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's aura system and may cache results
    for performance reasons. It should be called frequently during combat to ensure
    optimal pet behavior, but not so often as to cause performance degradation.
  warnings: The method may return false if the pet is not under the hunter's control
    or if the aspect has been removed by external effects. Ensure proper error handling
    when relying on this method for critical gameplay decisions.
