  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::SwitchToOptimalAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Switches the hunter to the optimal aspect based on current combat state and
    pet status.
  description: The SwitchToOptimalAspect method determines the most beneficial aspect
    for the hunter to apply based on the current combat situation, including whether
    a pet is active, the hunter's current target, and the state of their abilities.
    This method ensures that the hunter automatically selects the best available aspect
    (such as Aspect of the Hawk or Aspect of the Beast) to maximize damage output
    or survivability depending on the context. It typically integrates with the hunter's
    AI decision-making system to dynamically adjust aspects during combat.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n \
      \       m_hunter->SwitchToOptimalAspect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or when the hunter's
    state changes. It relies on internal logic to evaluate pet status, target type,
    and ability availability to make an informed decision about which aspect to apply.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in situations where the hunter has
    no valid pet or target, as it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the
    underlying conditions are not properly checked before invocation.
