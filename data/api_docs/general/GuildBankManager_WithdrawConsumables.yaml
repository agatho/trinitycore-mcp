documentation:
  brief: Withdraws consumable items from the guild bank for a specified player.
  description: The WithdrawConsumables method allows a player to withdraw consumable
    items, such as potions or food, from the guild bank. This operation typically
    involves checking the player's eligibility, verifying sufficient inventory space,
    and updating both the guild bank and player's inventory. The method is part of
    the GuildBankManager class which handles all guild bank-related operations in
    TrinityCore. It is commonly used during guild activities where members need to
    retrieve consumables for raids or dungeons.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player is performing the withdrawal operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Withdrawal Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.WithdrawConsumables(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to update both player and
    guild bank records. It may perform checks for item availability, player rank requirements,
    and inventory space limitations. The implementation might be part of a larger
    transaction system to ensure data consistency.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes a pointer to an integer, which
    could lead to issues if the value is not properly initialized or if null is passed.
    Ensure proper validation before calling this method.
