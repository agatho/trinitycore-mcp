  signature: void BotScheduler::ProcessSchedule()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the scheduled bot actions and updates their behavior based on the
    current game state.
  description: The ProcessSchedule method is responsible for executing all scheduled
    bot activities within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the current state
    of each bot, checks against predefined schedules, and performs appropriate actions
    such as movement, combat engagement, or quest progression. This method typically
    runs in a periodic loop to ensure bots maintain their intended behavior patterns.
    The method does not take any parameters and does not return a value, making it
    a void function that operates on internal bot state data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    botScheduler.ProcessSchedule();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop or a dedicated
    scheduler thread. It's important to ensure that this method doesn't block for
    extended periods as it can affect overall server performance. The implementation
    likely uses internal timers and state machines to determine which bots should
    be active at any given time.
