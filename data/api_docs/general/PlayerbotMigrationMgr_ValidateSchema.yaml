  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ValidateSchema
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ValidateSchema()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the schema of player bot migration data to ensure consistency and
    correctness before processing.
  description: The ValidateSchema method performs a comprehensive check on the structure
    and integrity of player bot migration data within the PlayerbotMigrationMgr. It
    ensures that all required fields are present, data types are correct, and logical
    constraints are satisfied. This validation is crucial for maintaining data consistency
    during player bot migration operations in TrinityCore. The method typically runs
    before any migration process begins to prevent corrupted or invalid data from
    being processed. It may also validate relationships between different data entities
    and check for referential integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the schema validation passes successfully, indicating that
    all data conforms to expected formats and constraints. Returns false if any validation
    failure is detected, which could be due to missing fields, incorrect data types,
    or logical inconsistencies in the migration data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Schema Validation Check
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* mgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\nif (mgr->ValidateSchema())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with migration\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Schema validation\
      \ passed. Starting migration...\");\n} else {\n    // Handle validation failure\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Schema validation failed. Aborting migration.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or before critical
    migration operations. It may perform database queries or file system checks depending
    on the data source being validated. The implementation should be efficient as
    it's often called in performance-sensitive contexts.
  warnings: Failure to validate schema properly can lead to data corruption or unexpected
    behavior during player bot migration. This method should not be bypassed in production
    environments without proper alternative validation mechanisms.
