documentation:
  brief: Attempts to consume and process a hostile event from the event bus.
  description: The TryConsumeEvent method is responsible for retrieving and handling
    a hostile event from the HostileEventBus. It checks if there is a pending hostile
    event in the queue and processes it if available. This method is typically used
    within the game's AI or combat systems to respond to hostile actions such as attacks,
    aggro generation, or threat updates. The method returns true if an event was successfully
    consumed and processed, or false if no event was available for consumption. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining proper combat state management and ensuring
    that hostile actions are properly handled in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a hostile event was successfully consumed and processed
    from the bus; returns false if no event was available to consume.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Consumption
    code: "HostileEvent event;\nif (hostileEventBus.TryConsumeEvent(event)) {\n  \
      \  // Process the hostile event\n    HandleHostileAction(event);\n} else {\n\
      \    // No hostile events to process\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"No hostile events in queue\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within game loop iterations or AI update
    routines. It's important to note that consuming an event removes it from the bus,
    so subsequent calls will not process the same event twice. The method may be blocking
    or non-blocking depending on implementation details of the underlying queue system.
  warnings: Ensure that the HostileEventBus is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Improper handling of returned events can lead to inconsistent combat
    states or missed hostile actions in the game world.
