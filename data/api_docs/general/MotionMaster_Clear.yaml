  class: MotionMaster
  method: Clear
  signature: void MotionMaster::Clear(MovementGeneratorPriority priority)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all movement generators associated with the specified priority level
    from the motion master.
  description: The Clear method removes all active movement generators that match
    the given priority level from the MotionMaster's internal list. This is typically
    used to stop or reset specific types of movement behaviors, such as stopping a
    creature's patrol or interrupting a player's movement sequence. The method operates
    on a per-priority basis, allowing fine-grained control over which movement behaviors
    are cleared without affecting others. It is commonly called during state transitions
    or when movement needs to be interrupted for gameplay reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The MovementGeneratorPriority enum value specifying which priority
      level of movement generators to clear. This determines which category of movement
      behaviors will be removed from the motion master's active list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear all movement generators with high priority
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->Clear(MOTION_PRIORITY_HIGHEST);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear patrol movement generators for a guard NPC
    code: "if (creature->IsGuard()) {\n    creature->GetMotionMaster()->Clear(MOTION_PRIORITY_PATROL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately stop ongoing movements; it only removes
    the movement generators from the active list. The actual stopping of movement
    may require additional handling depending on the specific MovementGenerator implementation.
    The MotionMaster maintains multiple priority levels to manage different types
    of movement behaviors simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling Clear with an incorrect priority level may unintentionally remove
    important movement behaviors. Always ensure that the priority value matches the
    intended movement generator type. This method should not be called during active
    movement processing as it might cause undefined behavior or crashes.
