  signature: int AzeriteItem::GetCurrentKnowledgeLevel()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current knowledge level of the Azerite item.
  description: The GetCurrentKnowledgeLevel method returns the current knowledge level
    associated with an Azerite item. In World of Warcraft, Azerite items have a knowledge
    system that tracks how much of the item's potential has been unlocked or learned
    by the player. This knowledge level typically corresponds to the amount of Azerite
    power the player has absorbed and can influence various aspects such as available
    traits, cosmetic appearance, and progression mechanics. The returned value usually
    represents an integer level indicating the depth of knowledge acquired for this
    specific Azerite item.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current knowledge level of the Azerite item.
    This value typically starts at 0 or 1 and increases as the player gains more Azerite
    power, with higher levels unlocking additional traits or abilities. Returns 0
    if no knowledge has been acquired yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();\nint knowledgeLevel = item->GetCurrentKnowledgeLevel();\n\
      if (knowledgeLevel > 0)\n{\n    // Item has some Azerite knowledge unlocked\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Current Azerite Knowledge Level: \" << knowledgeLevel <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Azerite progression systems
    and may be called during item updates or when checking the status of an Azerite
    item's unlock state. The exact behavior might vary depending on the game version
    and client implementation.
