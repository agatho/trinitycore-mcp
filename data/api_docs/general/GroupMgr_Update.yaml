documentation:
  brief: Updates the group manager's internal state and processes group-related operations.
  description: The GroupMgr::Update method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    and functionality of player groups within the TrinityCore framework. It handles
    various group-related tasks such as checking for member disconnections, updating
    group loot settings, managing group leadership transitions, and synchronizing
    group data across the game world. This method is typically called once per game
    tick to ensure that all group operations are processed in a timely manner. The
    implementation likely iterates through all active groups and performs necessary
    updates on each one.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(int diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n  \
      \  sGroupMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain group
    functionality. It's typically invoked from the main game world update cycle and
    may perform operations that affect multiple groups simultaneously, so performance
    considerations are important.
