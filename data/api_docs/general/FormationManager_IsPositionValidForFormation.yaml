  class: FormationManager
  method: IsPositionValidForFormation
  signature: bool FormationManager::IsPositionValidForFormation(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is valid for use in a formation.
  description: The IsPositionValidForFormation method determines whether a specified
    position index is valid for inclusion within a creature's formation. This validation
    ensures that positions used in formations adhere to predefined constraints, such
    as being within acceptable range or not conflicting with existing formation slots.
    The method typically checks against internal formation limits and may consider
    factors like position availability, distance from the leader, or formation type
    restrictions. It is commonly used during formation setup, movement updates, or
    when adding new members to an existing formation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index to validate within the formation. This value represents
      a slot number in the formation structure and must be a non-negative integer
      that does not exceed the maximum allowed formation position.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is valid for use in a formation,
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    position index is out of bounds or conflicts with existing formation rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (formationManager.IsPositionValidForFormation(3)) {\n    // Position\
      \ 3 can be used in the formation\n    std::cout << \"Position 3 is valid\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Position 3 cannot be used\n    std::cout << \"\
      Position 3 is invalid\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Setup Validation
    code: "int newPosition = 5;\nif (formationManager.IsPositionValidForFormation(newPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Add creature to formation at position\n    formationManager.AddMemberToFormation(creature,\
      \ newPosition);\n} else {\n    // Find next available position or handle error\n\
      \    int nextValidPos = formationManager.FindNextAvailablePosition();\n    if\
      \ (nextValidPos != -1) {\n        formationManager.AddMemberToFormation(creature,\
      \ nextValidPos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs bounds checking against a predefined maximum
    number of positions allowed in a formation. It may also perform additional checks
    based on the formation type or leader's current state. The method is expected
    to be lightweight and thread-safe, as it's frequently called during dynamic formation
    updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the position index passed to this method is within valid range;
    passing negative values or indices exceeding formation capacity may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect validation results.
