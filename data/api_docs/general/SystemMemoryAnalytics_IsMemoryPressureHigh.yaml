  class: SystemMemoryAnalytics
  method: IsMemoryPressureHigh
  signature: bool SystemMemoryAnalytics::IsMemoryPressureHigh() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the system memory pressure is currently high.
  description: The IsMemoryPressureHigh method evaluates the current system memory
    usage and returns true if the memory pressure exceeds a predefined threshold,
    indicating that the system is under significant memory stress. This method is
    typically used by the TrinityCore server to make runtime decisions regarding resource
    management, garbage collection, or performance throttling. It helps ensure stable
    operation by allowing the server to react proactively when memory resources become
    constrained. The check is performed based on system-wide memory metrics and may
    consider factors such as available physical RAM, virtual memory usage, and overall
    system load.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the system memory pressure is considered high, indicating
    potential performance issues or resource constraints; otherwise returns false
    when memory usage is within acceptable limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Logic
    code: "if (SystemMemoryAnalytics::IsMemoryPressureHigh()) {\n    // Trigger memory\
      \ cleanup or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"High memory pressure detected, initiating\
      \ cleanup.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring
    code: "class PerformanceMonitor {\npublic:\n    void CheckSystemHealth() {\n \
      \       if (SystemMemoryAnalytics::IsMemoryPressureHigh()) {\n            sLog->outError(\"\
      Memory pressure high, reducing non-critical operations.\");\n            //\
      \ Reduce background tasks or enable memory-saving mode\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using platform-specific APIs to query system
    memory statistics. It may cache results for performance reasons and could be called
    frequently during server operation, so it's optimized for quick execution. The
    exact threshold for 'high pressure' might be configurable or adaptive based on
    server load.
  warnings: The method should not be used as a definitive indicator of system stability
    without additional context. High memory pressure may not always lead to immediate
    crashes but can degrade performance significantly. Developers should consider
    combining this check with other resource monitoring mechanisms for comprehensive
    health assessment.
