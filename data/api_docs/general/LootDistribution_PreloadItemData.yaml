documentation:
  brief: Preloads item data for loot distribution calculations.
  description: The PreloadItemData method prepares and loads item-related information
    required for loot distribution processes within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures that all necessary item templates and associated data are cached
    in memory before loot decisions are made, improving performance during loot rolling
    or distribution events. It is typically invoked prior to initiating any loot distribution
    operations to guarantee that item data is readily available. The method operates
    on a collection of items identified by their unique identifiers, preparing them
    for subsequent processing.
  parameters:
  - name: items
    description: An integer reference representing the number or identifier of items
      to preload data for. This parameter likely specifies how many items should be
      loaded from the database or cache.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Preload Usage
    code: 'LootDistribution lootDist;

      int itemAmount = 10;

      lootDist.PreloadItemData(itemAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is crucial for optimizing performance in high-frequency loot
    scenarios such as dungeon or raid drops. It may internally perform database queries
    or cache lookups to gather item data, so calling it before loot events can prevent
    delays during actual distribution.
