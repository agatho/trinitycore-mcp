  class: GatheringManager
  method: ScanForNodes
  signature: int GatheringManager::ScanForNodes(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for gathering nodes within a specified range and returns the count
    of found nodes.
  description: The ScanForNodes method searches for valid gathering nodes (such as
    herbs, ores, or minerals) within a given range around the calling object. It iterates
    through the surrounding area and identifies all nodes that match the criteria
    for gathering based on game mechanics and node types. This method is typically
    used by players or NPCs to locate resources they can gather. The method returns
    an integer representing the number of valid gathering nodes found in the specified
    range.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of gathering nodes found within
    the specified range. A return value of zero means no valid nodes were found, while
    a positive integer indicates the count of nodes available for gathering.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int nodeCount = gatheringManager.ScanForNodes(10.0f);\nif (nodeCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with gathering logic\n    printf(\"Found %d gathering\
      \ nodes nearby.\\n\", nodeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Character
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nGatheringManager*\
      \ manager = player->GetGatheringManager();\nint nodesFound = manager->ScanForNodes(25.0f);\n\
      if (nodesFound > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger UI or gather logic\n    player->SendGatherableNodes(nodesFound);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform spatial queries and could have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. It is recommended to cache results or limit
    scan frequency to avoid unnecessary overhead. The range parameter affects the
    area of search, so larger ranges will increase processing time.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GatheringManager
    or with invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the object
    calling this method has valid context (e.g., is part of a world entity) before
    invoking it.
