  method: RemoveAllPlayerBots
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::RemoveAllPlayerBots(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all player bots associated with a specified account ID from the world
    session manager.
  description: The RemoveAllPlayerBots method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all bot instances that are linked to a specific user account. This function ensures
    that when an account is deleted or when a cleanup operation is required, all associated
    bot characters are properly disposed of and removed from active gameplay sessions.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's bot management system,
    which allows players to control automated characters for various purposes such
    as farming, questing, or training. It is typically invoked during account deletion
    processes or administrative cleanup operations to maintain server integrity and
    prevent orphaned bot references.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the player account whose bots are to be
      removed. This value must correspond to a valid account in the database, otherwise
      the operation will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove all bots for a given account
    code: BotWorldSessionMgr::instance()->RemoveAllPlayerBots(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Cleanup bots upon account deletion
    code: "void HandleAccountDelete(uint32 accountId)\n{\n    // Perform account deletion\
      \ logic here\n    \n    // Remove all associated bots\n    BotWorldSessionMgr::instance()->RemoveAllPlayerBots(accountId);\n\
      \    \n    // Continue with account deletion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all active sessions and identifies those
    belonging to the specified account, then removes them from the session manager.
    It may also involve database cleanup operations to ensure no references remain
    in persistent storage. The operation is typically synchronous and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Calling this method on an account ID that does not exist or has no bots
    will result in a no-op but may still incur minor overhead from internal lookup
    operations. It's recommended to verify account existence before calling this function
    to avoid unnecessary processing.
