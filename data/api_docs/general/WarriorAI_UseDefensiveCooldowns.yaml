documentation:
  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns for the warrior AI.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for activating appropriate
    defensive abilities and cooldowns within the WarriorAI class. This method evaluates
    the current combat state, health levels, and threat situation to determine which
    defensive cooldowns should be used. It typically includes abilities such as Shield
    Block, Defensive Stance, or other cooldowns that provide temporary damage reduction
    or mitigation. The method is called during the AI's update cycle to ensure optimal
    use of defensive resources based on the warrior's current needs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Warrior AI Update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    UseDefensiveCooldowns();\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should only
    be invoked when the warrior is in combat. The decision to use defensive cooldowns
    is based on internal AI state, health percentage, and threat level. It's important
    that this method doesn't interfere with other AI behaviors or abilities.
  warnings: The method assumes the warrior is in a valid combat state. Calling it
    outside of combat may result in improper cooldown usage or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
