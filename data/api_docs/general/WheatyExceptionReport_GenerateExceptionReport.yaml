  method: GenerateExceptionReport
  signature: void WheatyExceptionReport::GenerateExceptionReport(PEXCEPTION_POINTERS
    pExceptionInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed exception report including stack trace and system information
    when an unhandled exception occurs in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The GenerateExceptionReport method is designed to capture comprehensive
    diagnostic information when an unhandled exception is encountered within the TrinityCore
    server environment. This function processes the provided exception information
    pointer to extract relevant data such as register states, call stack frames, and
    system context. The generated report typically includes memory addresses, thread
    identifiers, and other debugging metadata that can be used by developers to analyze
    and resolve crashes or unexpected behavior in the game server. This method is
    usually invoked automatically by the system's structured exception handling mechanism
    when a critical error occurs during runtime execution.
  parameters:
  - name: pExceptionInfo
    description: Pointer to an EXCEPTION_POINTERS structure containing detailed information
      about the exception that occurred, including the exception record and context
      record which provide register states and stack information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handler
    code: "void MyExceptionHandler(EXCEPTION_POINTERS* pExceptionInfo)\n{\n    WheatyExceptionReport\
      \ reporter;\n    reporter.GenerateExceptionReport(pExceptionInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within a structured exception handler
    and should not be invoked directly by regular application code. The generated
    report may include sensitive memory addresses and system information that could
    be useful for debugging but should be handled securely in production environments.
  warnings: Invoking this method manually without proper exception context may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the EXCEPTION_POINTERS parameter
    is valid and not null before calling this function to avoid access violations.
