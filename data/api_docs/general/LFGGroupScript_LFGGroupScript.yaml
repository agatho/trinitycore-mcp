documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LFGGroupScript class for handling Looking
    For Group functionality.
  description: The LFGGroupScript constructor initializes the necessary internal state
    and data structures required for managing group finding operations within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method sets up default values and prepares the script
    to handle LFG-related events and interactions. It is automatically called when
    a new LFGGroupScript object is created, ensuring proper initialization before
    any LFG functionality is invoked. The constructor does not require any parameters
    as it initializes all internal members to their default states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an LFGGroupScript instance
    code: 'LFGGroupScript* lfgScript = new LFGGroupScript();

      // The constructor is automatically called here

      // lfgScript is now ready to handle LFG events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by user code but rather
    through the TrinityCore scripting system when registering LFG scripts. Developers
    should ensure that any custom LFG script classes properly inherit from LFGGroupScript
    and call the base constructor if overriding.
