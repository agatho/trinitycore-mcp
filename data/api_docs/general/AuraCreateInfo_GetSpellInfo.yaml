  class: AuraCreateInfo
  method: GetSpellInfo
  signature: const SpellInfo * AuraCreateInfo::GetSpellInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SpellInfo structure associated with the aura creation context.
  description: The GetSpellInfo method returns a pointer to the SpellInfo object that
    defines the properties and behavior of the spell associated with this aura creation
    instance. This method provides access to detailed spell data such as duration,
    effects, targets, and other spell-related attributes. The returned SpellInfo pointer
    is valid for the lifetime of the AuraCreateInfo object and should not be modified
    directly. This functionality is commonly used during aura application or removal
    logic to determine how an aura should behave based on its underlying spell definition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the SpellInfo structure that describes the spell
    associated with this aura creation context. Returns nullptr if no spell information
    is available or if the aura was created without a valid spell reference.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: "void OnAuraApply(Aura* aura, AuraEffect const* effect, bool apply)\n{\n\
      \    AuraCreateInfo createInfo(aura);\n    const SpellInfo* spellInfo = createInfo.GetSpellInfo();\n\
      \    if (spellInfo && spellInfo->HasAttribute(SPELL_ATTR0_AURA_IS_CASTER))\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle aura application logic for caster-based auras\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Spell Duration from AuraCreateInfo
    code: "uint32 GetAuraDuration(Aura* aura)\n{\n    AuraCreateInfo createInfo(aura);\n\
      \    const SpellInfo* spellInfo = createInfo.GetSpellInfo();\n    if (spellInfo)\n\
      \        return spellInfo->GetDuration();\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SpellInfo pointer is managed by the core and should not be deleted
    or modified. This method is typically called during aura application/removal phases
    when spell context information is needed for game logic decisions.
