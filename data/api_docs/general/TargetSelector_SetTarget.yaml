  class: TargetSelector
  method: SetTarget
  signature: void TargetSelector::SetTarget(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target pointer for the target selector to the provided integer address.
  description: The SetTarget method assigns a target pointer to the TargetSelector
    instance. This method is typically used in AI systems within TrinityCore to define
    which entity (such as a player or creature) the selector should focus on. The
    target parameter is expected to be a pointer to an integer that represents the
    target's identifier or memory address. This method does not perform any validation
    on the input pointer, so it's important that the caller ensures the pointer is
    valid and properly initialized before passing it to this function. The behavior
    of subsequent operations using this target selector may depend on how the target
    pointer is interpreted by other methods in the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or memory
      address. This parameter should point to a valid integer value, typically representing
      a GUID or similar unique identifier used within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      TargetSelector selector;

      selector.SetTarget(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Target from Creature GUID
    code: 'Creature* targetCreature = ...; // Some creature in the world

      int* targetPtr = &targetCreature->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      TargetSelector selector;

      selector.SetTarget(targetPtr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment of the pointer without any validation
    or reference counting. It's crucial that the target pointer remains valid for
    as long as the TargetSelector instance is in use, otherwise accessing the target
    may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to this method can lead to crashes
    or unpredictable behavior. Always ensure that the integer pointed to by 'target'
    is properly initialized and valid before calling this method.
