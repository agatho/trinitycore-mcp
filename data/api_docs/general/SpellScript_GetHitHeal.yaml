  signature: int SpellScript::GetHitHeal() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of health healed by the spell hit
  description: The GetHitHeal method retrieves the actual amount of health points
    that were restored to the target unit as a result of the spell's healing effect.
    This value represents the final healed amount after all modifiers, such as critical
    strikes, healing multipliers, and target resistance, have been applied. The method
    is typically used within SpellScript implementations to access healing values
    for custom logic or modifications. It should only be called during the appropriate
    spell execution phase when the healing value has been calculated and finalized.
  parameters: []
  returns: The integer value representing the total amount of health points healed
    to the target unit, or 0 if no healing occurred or the method was called at an
    inappropriate time during spell execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MyHealSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHeal()\n\
      \    {\n        int healedAmount = GetHitHeal();\n        if (healedAmount >\
      \ 0)\n        {\n            // Custom logic based on healed amount\n      \
      \      SendCustomMessage(\"Healed for \" + std::to_string(healedAmount) + \"\
      \ points.\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Healing Amount Based on Hit Value
    code: "class ModifiedHealSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ ModifyHealing()\n    {\n        int baseHeal = GetHitHeal();\n        if (baseHeal\
      \ > 100)\n        {\n            // Apply additional effect for large heals\n\
      \            AddExtraEffect(5); // Add 5 extra healing points\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the spell's execution phase when
    healing values are finalized. Calling it before healing is calculated or after
    the spell has completed may return incorrect or undefined values. The returned
    value includes all modifiers applied by the game engine, such as critical heal
    chances and buffs/debuffs affecting healing effectiveness.
  warnings: Do not use this method outside of spell script execution context as it
    may lead to accessing invalid memory or returning zero values. Be aware that the
    healing amount might be reduced to zero if the target is already at full health
    or if healing modifiers result in no effective healing.
