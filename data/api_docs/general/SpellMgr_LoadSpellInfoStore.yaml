  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellInfoStore()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all spell information into the SpellMgr's internal
    data structures from database storage.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoStore method is responsible for loading all spell-related
    data from the game's database into memory. This includes spell definitions, effects,
    cooldowns, mana costs, and other spell properties that are essential for spell
    execution during gameplay. The method typically runs once during server startup
    or when spell data needs to be refreshed. It populates internal lookup tables
    and caches that allow fast access to spell information during combat and player
    interactions. This method is crucial for ensuring that all spells function correctly
    within the game world, as missing or improperly loaded spell data can lead to
    broken abilities or unexpected behavior.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoStore();\n\
      \    // Spell data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    spell data needs to be reloaded. It performs database queries and memory allocations,
    so calling it repeatedly may cause performance issues. The method is typically
    invoked from the core server startup sequence before any gameplay begins.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active gameplay as it may cause race conditions
    or inconsistent spell states. This method should only be executed when no players
    are actively using spells to prevent data corruption or unexpected behavior.
