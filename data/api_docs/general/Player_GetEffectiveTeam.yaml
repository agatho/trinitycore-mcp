  class: Player
  method: GetEffectiveTeam
  signature: int Player::GetEffectiveTeam() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the effective team number for the player, which determines group
    assignment and raid composition.
  description: The GetEffectiveTeam method retrieves the team identifier that is used
    to determine a player's group membership within the game's raid system. This value
    is crucial for determining which group a player belongs to when they are in a
    raid or party instance, and affects how their loot distribution and quest progression
    is handled. The method returns an integer representing the team number, which
    can be used to identify specific groups within a raid or party context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the effective team number of the
    player. This value typically corresponds to a group number within a raid or party
    structure, and can be used to determine group assignment for loot distribution,
    quest progression, and other game mechanics related to group composition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int team = player->GetEffectiveTeam();\nif (team == 1)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ belongs to team 1\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player belongs to another team\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group-related methods
    such as GetGroup() or GetRaidGroup(). It's important to note that the effective
    team number may change depending on whether the player is in a raid or party,
    and can be influenced by game mechanics like group size and player level.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining player's current group
    membership directly without checking if they are in a raid or party context. The
    value returned may not reflect actual group assignment if the player is not in
    a proper group context.
