  class: MovementArbiterStatistics
  method: GetAcceptanceRate
  signature: double MovementArbiterStatistics::GetAcceptanceRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the acceptance rate of movement requests handled by
    the arbiter.
  description: The GetAcceptanceRate method computes the ratio of accepted movement
    requests to the total number of movement requests processed by the MovementArbiterStatistics
    instance. This metric is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and responsiveness
    of the movement arbitration system within TrinityCore's AI and pathfinding subsystems.
    The value represents a percentage-like double where 1.0 indicates all requests
    were accepted, and 0.0 indicates no requests were accepted. The method is typically
    used for performance analysis, debugging, or tuning of movement-related systems
    in the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the acceptance rate as a decimal between 0.0
    and 1.0, where 1.0 means all requests were accepted and 0.0 means no requests
    were accepted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MovementArbiterStatistics stats;

      // ... populate stats with movement data ...

      double acceptanceRate = stats.GetAcceptanceRate();

      std::cout << "Movement acceptance rate: " << acceptanceRate * 100 << "%" <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorMovementArbiter() {\n    MovementArbiterStatistics stats;\n\
      \    double rate = stats.GetAcceptanceRate();\n    if (rate < 0.8) {\n     \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Low movement acceptance rate detected: %.2f%%\", rate *\
      \ 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using atomic operations or thread-safe
    counters to ensure accurate statistics in a multi-threaded environment. The calculation
    may be performed on-the-fly or cached, depending on implementation details. It's
    recommended to cache the return value if the method is called frequently within
    tight loops.
  warnings: The acceptance rate may fluctuate significantly during high-load periods
    or when movement requests are being throttled due to server capacity constraints.
    Do not assume a consistent rate without proper sampling over time.
