  class: LootAnalysis
  method: LearnFromPlayerChoices
  signature: void LootAnalysis::LearnFromPlayerChoices(Player * player, const int
    & choices)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal loot analysis data based on player choices during loot distribution.
  description: The LearnFromPlayerChoices method processes and records player decisions
    made during a loot roll or distribution event. It updates the internal state of
    the LootAnalysis class to reflect how players have chosen to distribute items,
    which can be used for future loot optimization or statistical analysis. This method
    is typically invoked when a player makes a choice such as 'need', 'greed', or
    'pass' during a group loot session. The method does not directly modify player
    data but rather accumulates choices for analytical purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose choices are being recorded. Must
      be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: choices
    description: 'Integer value representing the player''s choice during loot distribution.
      Values typically correspond to: 0 = pass, 1 = need, 2 = greed. May also include
      additional flags or extended choice values depending on game version.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Roll Handler
    code: "void HandleLootRoll(Player* player, int choice) {\n    LootAnalysis analysis;\n\
      \    analysis.LearnFromPlayerChoices(player, choice);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Player Choices
    code: "std::vector<Player*> players = GetGroupMembers();\nint choices[] = {1,\
      \ 2, 0, 1}; // need, greed, pass, need\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < players.size();\
      \ ++i) {\n    if (players[i]) {\n        analysis.LearnFromPlayerChoices(players[i],\
      \ choices[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger loot analysis system that may be used for
    AI-driven loot distribution or player behavior tracking. The internal data structure
    for storing choices should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads during
    concurrent loot events.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'player' parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the 'choices' value is within expected bounds to avoid corrupting internal
    state.
