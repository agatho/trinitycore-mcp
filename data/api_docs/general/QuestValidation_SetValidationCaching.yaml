documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables quest validation caching within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The SetValidationCaching method controls whether quest validation results
    are cached to improve performance. When enabled, the system stores previously
    validated quest data in memory to avoid redundant computations during subsequent
    checks. This is particularly useful for high-traffic servers where frequent quest
    validation could become a bottleneck. The caching mechanism helps reduce database
    load and improves response times for quest-related operations such as quest acceptance,
    completion, and status checks. Disabling caching will force all validations to
    be performed fresh each time, which may impact performance but ensures the most
    up-to-date validation results.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Quest Validation Caching
    code: QuestValidation::SetValidationCaching(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Quest Validation Caching
    code: QuestValidation::SetValidationCaching(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global quest validation behavior across all players
    and zones. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent validation requests.
    The caching system automatically manages memory usage and will evict older entries
    when memory pressure is detected.
  warnings: Disabling caching may significantly impact server performance during high-traffic
    periods. Ensure that any changes to this setting are made with consideration of
    the server's resource constraints and player activity levels.
