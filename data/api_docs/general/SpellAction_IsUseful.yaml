documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell action is beneficial or useful for the bot's current
    state and target.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if a given spell action should be considered
    for execution by the AI. It takes into account various factors such as the bot's
    current health, mana, target status, and spell properties to determine usefulness.
    This method is typically used during spell selection logic within the BotAI system
    to filter out spells that would not provide strategic value at the current moment.
    The evaluation includes checking if the spell is currently usable (e.g., not on
    cooldown), if the target is valid, and whether the spell's effects align with
    the bot's current tactical situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell action is deemed useful or beneficial for the
    bot to execute at this time; otherwise returns false. A return value of false
    typically indicates that executing this spell would be ineffective or counterproductive
    given the current game state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (spellAction->IsUseful(ai)) {\n    ai->CastSpell(spellAction);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell prioritization system
    code: "std::vector<SpellAction*> usefulSpells;\nfor (auto& action : spellActions)\
      \ {\n    if (action->IsUseful(ai)) {\n        usefulSpells.push_back(action);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Prioritize and cast the most useful spell\nif (!usefulSpells.empty())\
      \ {\n    ai->CastSpell(usefulSpells.front());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during AI decision-making cycles,
    so performance considerations are important. It may internally check spell cooldowns,
    target validity, and resource requirements. The implementation probably uses cached
    or precomputed values to avoid expensive recalculations.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell marked as 'useful' will always be successful
    in its application. The method only evaluates potential usefulness, not actual
    outcome. Also, ensure that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method.
