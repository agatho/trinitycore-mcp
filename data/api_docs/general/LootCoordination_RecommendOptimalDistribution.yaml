  class: LootCoordination
  method: RecommendOptimalDistribution
  signature: void LootCoordination::RecommendOptimalDistribution(Group * group, const
    int & items)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and recommends the optimal distribution of loot items among group
    members based on current loot rules and player participation.
  description: The RecommendOptimalDistribution method evaluates the current group's
    loot settings, player roles, and item characteristics to determine the most appropriate
    way to distribute items. This method is typically invoked during loot coordination
    processes in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. It considers
    factors such as loot master status, group composition, and individual player needs
    to suggest an optimal distribution strategy. The method does not directly perform
    the distribution but rather computes and recommends how the loot should be allocated
    among group members according to established rules.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot distribution
      is being coordinated. Must not be null.
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of items to be distributed.
      Used to determine distribution strategy based on item count.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with group and item count
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int itemCount = 5;

      lootCoordination->RecommendOptimalDistribution(myGroup, itemCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in loot coordination context
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(Player* player, uint32 itemEntry)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (!group) return;\n    \n    int itemsToDistribute\
      \ = 1;\n    lootCoordination->RecommendOptimalDistribution(group, itemsToDistribute);\n\
      \    // Proceed with actual distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system and should be called
    when preparing to distribute loot within a group. It works in conjunction with
    other loot-related methods such as DistributeLoot() or NotifyGroup(). The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific loot rules configured for the group (e.g.,
    round-robin, free-for-all, master loot).
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Incorrect usage with invalid group references can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes in the server.
