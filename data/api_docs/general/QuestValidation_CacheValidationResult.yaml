  class: QuestValidation
  method: CacheValidationResult
  signature: void QuestValidation::CacheValidationResult(uint32 questId, uint32 botGuid,
    const ValidationResult & result)
documentation:
  brief: Caches the validation result for a specific quest and bot combination within
    the QuestValidation system.
  description: The CacheValidationResult method stores the outcome of a quest validation
    check for a given quest ID and bot GUID. This cached result can be retrieved later
    to avoid recomputing validation logic, improving performance in scenarios where
    the same quest is validated multiple times. The method integrates with TrinityCore's
    quest system to maintain consistency between validation states and bot behavior.
    It is typically called during quest acceptance, completion, or status checks when
    a bot interacts with a quest.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must be a valid
      quest ID registered in the game database.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot performing the validation.
      Used to associate results with specific bot instances.
  - name: result
    description: The validation result object containing the outcome of the quest
      validation check. Should include success/failure status and relevant metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: QuestValidation::CacheValidationResult(12345, 67890, ValidationResult(true,
      "Quest is valid"));
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "ValidationResult result = ValidateQuest(playerGuid, questId);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    QuestValidation::CacheValidationResult(questId, botGuid, result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal cache structure to store validation results.
    It may be thread-safe depending on implementation but should not be called concurrently
    with other methods modifying the same cache entry without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that questId and botGuid are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid identifiers could lead to undefined behavior or cache corruption. The
    ValidationResult object must be properly initialized to avoid memory issues.
