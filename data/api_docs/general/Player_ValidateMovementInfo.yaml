  brief: Validates movement information for player
  description: This method performs validation checks on movement data for a player,
    ensuring that movement information is consistent and properly formatted before
    processing. It typically checks for valid movement types, coordinates, and other
    movement-related parameters to prevent invalid movement data from causing issues
    in the game world. The method is used internally by TrinityCore to validate movement
    packets received from players.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement handling to ensure data integrity.
    It may involve checking for valid movement types and coordinates, and could be
    part of a larger validation process in the game engine.
  warnings: Improperly validated movement data can lead to client-side disconnects
    or server-side errors. This method should only be used when movement data is being
    processed by the server.
