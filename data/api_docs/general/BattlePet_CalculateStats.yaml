  method: CalculateStats
  signature: void BattlePet::CalculateStats()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the statistical attributes of a battle pet based on
    its species, level, and other modifiers.
  description: The CalculateStats method computes and applies all relevant statistics
    for a BattlePet instance, including health, power, speed, and any breed-specific
    bonuses. This method is typically invoked when a pet's level changes, when it
    is initialized, or when its stats need to be recalculated after modifications
    such as breeding or training. The calculation takes into account the pet's species
    ID, current level, and any temporary or permanent stat modifiers that may affect
    its performance in battle. It ensures that all internal stat values are consistent
    with the game's balance mechanics and that the pet is properly equipped for combat.

  examples:
  - title: Recalculate Pet Stats After Level Up
    code: "BattlePet* pet = player->GetBattlePet();\nif (pet)\n{\n    pet->SetLevel(newLevel);\n\
      \    pet->CalculateStats();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Pet Stats on Creation
    code: 'BattlePet* newPet = new BattlePet(speciesId, level);

      newPet->CalculateStats();

      player->AddBattlePet(newPet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any modification that affects a pet's
    stats, such as leveling up or changing breed. It is not thread-safe and should
    only be executed on the main game thread to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BattlePet object
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect stat calculations. Ensure all required
    fields like species ID and level are set before invoking this function.
