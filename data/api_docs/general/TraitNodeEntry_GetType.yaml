  method: GetType
  signature: TraitNodeType TraitNodeEntry::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type of the trait node entry.
  description: The GetType method returns the TraitNodeType enumeration value that
    represents the category or classification of the trait node. This is used to determine
    how the trait node should be handled within the game's trait system, such as whether
    it is a primary, secondary, or passive trait node. The returned value helps in
    identifying the functional behavior and visual representation of the trait node
    in the user interface and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A TraitNodeType enumeration value indicating the type of the trait node.
    Possible values include but are not limited to: TRAIT_NODE_TYPE_PRIMARY, TRAIT_NODE_TYPE_SECONDARY,
    TRAIT_NODE_TYPE_PASSIVE, etc., depending on the specific implementation and game
    version.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TraitNodeEntry* node = sTraitMgr->GetTraitNodeEntry(12345);\nif (node)\n\
      {\n    TraitNodeType type = node->GetType();\n    // Use the type to determine\
      \ how to process the trait node\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any complex operations.
    It directly accesses a cached or stored value within the TraitNodeEntry object,
    making it efficient for frequent calls during gameplay logic.
