documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SmartAI behavior for a creature or game object, setting up
    internal state and AI configuration.
  description: The InitializeAI method is responsible for setting up and initializing
    the SmartAI system for a creature or game object within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during the creation or spawning of an AI-enabled
    entity to configure its behavior patterns, initialize internal data structures,
    and prepare the AI for operation. It ensures that all necessary components are
    properly initialized before the AI begins executing its scripted behaviors. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations,
    but it sets up the foundation for subsequent AI execution through SmartAI's event-driven
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "void OnSpawn()\n{\n    if (Creature* creature = me->ToCreature())\n   \
      \ {\n        creature->AI()->InitializeAI();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an AI-enabled
    entity. It is typically invoked automatically by the core framework when a creature
    or game object is created with SmartAI enabled. The initialization process includes
    setting up internal state variables, loading behavior configurations, and preparing
    event handlers.
  warnings: Calling InitializeAI multiple times on the same AI instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that this method is only invoked during
    proper object construction or activation phases, not during active AI execution.
