documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can enter or exit a vehicle seat based on seat
    restrictions and requirements.
  description: The CanEnterOrExit method evaluates whether a player is permitted to
    enter or exit a specific vehicle seat. This check considers various factors such
    as seat flags, required aura states, player class restrictions, and vehicle-specific
    conditions. The method returns true if all necessary prerequisites are met for
    entry or exit, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this functionality is crucial for managing vehicle interactions and ensuring players
    can only board vehicles under appropriate circumstances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can enter or exit the vehicle seat, false if
    entry/exit is restricted by seat configuration or player state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vehicle Interaction
    code: "if (vehicleSeat->CanEnterOrExit()) {\n    // Allow player to board the\
      \ vehicle\n    player->EnterVehicle(vehicle);\n} else {\n    // Notify player\
      \ they cannot enter\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot board this vehicle.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Seat Access Before Mounting
    code: "VehicleSeatEntry const* seat = vehicle->GetSeatForPassenger(player);\n\
      if (seat && seat->CanEnterOrExit()) {\n    // Proceed with mounting logic\n\
      \    player->Mount(vehicle->GetEntry());\n} else {\n    // Handle restricted\
      \ access\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Access denied.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during vehicle interaction events and relies
    on internal seat configuration data. It does not perform any external API calls
    or database lookups, making it efficient for frequent checks during gameplay.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees successful entry/exit;
    additional validation may be required depending on the specific vehicle type and
    player state. This method should only be used in contexts where vehicle seat permissions
    are being evaluated.
