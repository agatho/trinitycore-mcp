  method: FindMetadata
  signature: const BehaviorMetadata * BehaviorPriorityManager::FindMetadata(Strategy
    * strategy) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves behavior metadata associated with a given strategy from the priority
    manager.
  description: The FindMetadata method searches for and returns the BehaviorMetadata
    object that corresponds to the specified Strategy within the BehaviorPriorityManager.
    This method is used to access detailed configuration and behavioral attributes
    of strategies, which are essential for AI decision-making processes in TrinityCore's
    game systems. The method performs a lookup operation using the strategy's identifier
    or properties to locate matching metadata. It is typically called during AI processing
    phases where specific behavior characteristics need to be retrieved for execution
    or evaluation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the const BehaviorMetadata object if a match is found, or
    nullptr if no corresponding metadata exists for the given strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = ...;\nStrategy* strategy = ...;\nconst\
      \ BehaviorMetadata* metadata = manager->FindMetadata(strategy);\nif (metadata\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the metadata for AI decision making\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Found behavior metadata for strategy: {}\", metadata->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation that may involve internal data structure
    traversal. It is recommended to cache the returned pointer if it's accessed frequently
    to avoid repeated lookups. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the BehaviorPriorityManager
    and its associated metadata remain in scope.
