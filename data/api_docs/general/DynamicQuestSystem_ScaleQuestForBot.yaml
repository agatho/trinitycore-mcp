  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ScaleQuestForBot
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ScaleQuestForBot(QuestMetadata & metadata, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Scales quest data for a bot player based on their level and other factors.
  description: The ScaleQuestForBot method adjusts the parameters of a given quest
    metadata to match the capabilities and level of a specified bot player. This ensures
    that quests assigned to bots are appropriately challenging and relevant to their
    current game state. The scaling typically modifies reward values, quest requirements,
    and difficulty indicators to maintain balance within the game mechanics. This
    function is crucial for maintaining immersion and fairness when bots are used
    in dynamic quest systems, such as those involving automated gameplay or AI-driven
    quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: metadata
    description: Reference to the QuestMetadata object that contains the original
      quest data to be scaled.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose level and
      stats will influence how the quest is scaled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ScaleQuestForBot
    code: 'QuestMetadata questData;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      DynamicQuestSystem::ScaleQuestForBot(questData, myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the metadata in-place and does not return a new object.
    It is expected that the bot player has valid level and stats before calling this
    function to ensure accurate scaling.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the bot player pointer is valid may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, modifying quest data in
    place can affect other systems relying on the original metadata if not handled
    carefully.
