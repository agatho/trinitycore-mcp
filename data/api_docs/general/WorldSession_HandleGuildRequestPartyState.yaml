documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild party state request from a player, retrieving and sending
    party information related to the player's guild.
  description: The HandleGuildRequestPartyState method handles incoming requests from
    players for their guild's party state information. This typically occurs when
    a player opens the guild roster or party window and the client requests updated
    party status data for guild members. The method retrieves relevant party information
    such as member online status, group membership, and role assignments, then sends
    this data back to the requesting player through a packet response. It is part
    of the core guild management functionality in TrinityCore's WorldSession handling
    system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildRequestPartyState(WorldPackets::Guild::RequestGuildPartyState&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would retrieve party state data\n\
      \    // and send it back to the player's session\n    SendGuildPartyState();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with guild-related
    UI elements that require real-time party status information. The implementation
    likely involves checking the player's guild membership, retrieving associated
    group data from the database or cache, and formatting this information into a
    response packet.
