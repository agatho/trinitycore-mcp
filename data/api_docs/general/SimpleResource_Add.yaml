  class: SimpleResource
  method: Add
  signature: uint32 SimpleResource::Add(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Adds the specified amount to the resource and returns the updated total.
  description: The Add method increments the internal resource counter by the provided
    amount. It is typically used in game mechanics where resources such as gold, reputation,
    or currency need to be increased. The method ensures thread safety when accessing
    shared resource states. This operation does not validate whether the resulting
    value exceeds any maximum limits; it simply adds the specified amount and returns
    the new total. The method is commonly used in player interaction events, quest
    rewards, or loot distribution systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity to add to the current resource value. Must be a non-negative
      integer. Values greater than zero will increase the resource count.
  returns: Returns the updated total value of the resource after adding the specified
    amount. If the addition results in an overflow, behavior depends on the underlying
    data type implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Addition
    code: 'SimpleResource gold;

      gold.Add(100); // Adds 100 gold to the resource

      uint32 currentGold = gold.GetAmount(); // Returns 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Resources in a Quest Reward System
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      SimpleResource reputation;

      reputation.Add(player->GetQuestRewardReputation());

      // Adds reputation gained from quest completion to the player''s total'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that resource management is handled in a single-threaded
    context or with appropriate locking mechanisms. The implementation likely uses
    atomic operations or mutexes for thread safety depending on how it's integrated
    into the larger TrinityCore system.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not cause integer overflow when
    added to the current resource value. In some contexts, such as gold or currency,
    very large amounts may exceed the maximum value of uint32 and lead to unexpected
    behavior.
