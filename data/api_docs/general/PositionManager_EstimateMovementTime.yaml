  signature: float PositionManager::EstimateMovementTime(const int & from, const int
    & to)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time required to move between two positions in the game world.
  description: The EstimateMovementTime method calculates an approximate movement
    duration between two given positions within the TrinityCore framework. This estimation
    takes into account various factors such as character speed, terrain differences,
    and potential obstacles that may affect movement. The method is commonly used
    for AI pathfinding, player movement validation, or calculating travel times in
    quest systems. It returns a floating-point value representing the estimated time
    in seconds. The positions are typically identified by unique identifiers or coordinates
    within the game world's coordinate system.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The identifier or index of the starting position from which movement
      begins.
  - name: to
    description: The identifier or index of the destination position to which movement
      is calculated.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated time in seconds required to move
    from the 'from' position to the 'to' position. Returns zero if either position
    is invalid or if no movement is required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EstimateMovementTime
    code: "PositionManager* posMgr = ...;\nfloat time = posMgr->EstimateMovementTime(10,\
      \ 25);\nif (time > 0.0f) {\n    printf(\"Estimated movement time: %.2f seconds\\\
      n\", time);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using EstimateMovementTime for AI decision making
    code: "PositionManager* posMgr = ...;\nint playerPos = GetPlayerPositionId();\n\
      int npcPos = GetNPCPositionId();\nfloat travelTime = posMgr->EstimateMovementTime(playerPos,\
      \ npcPos);\nif (travelTime < 10.0f) {\n    // Proceed with interaction\n   \
      \ InteractWithNPC();\n} else {\n    // Consider alternative actions\n    FindAlternativePath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides an estimation only and does not account for real-time
    dynamic changes in movement conditions such as temporary environmental effects
    or player state modifications. The accuracy of the result depends on how well
    the underlying position data represents actual game world geometry. For performance-critical
    applications, caching previous results may be beneficial.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this estimation for precise timing-sensitive operations
    like combat mechanics or teleportation validation. The returned value should be
    used as a rough guide rather than an exact measurement. Invalid position identifiers
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect time estimates.
