  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: SetEventAutoSignup
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventAutoSignup(uint32 playerGuid, GuildEventType
    eventType, bool autoSignup)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a player should automatically sign up for a specific guild event
    type.
  description: The SetEventAutoSignup method configures a player's automatic signup
    preference for a specified guild event type. When enabled, the player will be
    automatically enrolled in future events of that type without manual intervention.
    This functionality supports guild event management by allowing players to opt
    into recurring events such as raids, dungeons, or social gatherings. The method
    operates on a per-player, per-event-type basis and updates internal tracking structures
    within the GuildEventCoordinator. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent
    event signups but do not retroactively affect already registered events.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auto-signup preference
      is being modified. Must correspond to a valid online or offline player in the
      game world.
  - name: eventType
    description: The type of guild event for which the auto-signup setting is applied.
      This should be one of the predefined GuildEventType values such as GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_RAID,
      GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_DUNGEON, etc.
  - name: autoSignup
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether automatic signup should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false) for the specified event type and player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable auto-signup for raid events
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventAutoSignup(123456, GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_RAID,
      true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable auto-signup for dungeon events
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventAutoSignup(playerGuid, GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_DUNGEON,
      false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that persists across server sessions.
    It is typically called in response to player commands or guild management actions.
    The implementation assumes the player GUID and event type are valid before processing.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid corresponds to an actual existing player; invalid
    GUIDs may cause undefined behavior. Also, this setting only affects future events,
    not those already in progress or completed.
