documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another ControlZoneHandler object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the right-hand side ControlZoneHandler object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate ControlZoneHandler
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method
    performs a move semantics operation, leaving the source object in a valid but
    unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this operator would be relevant when managing control zone handlers that may represent
    player interaction zones or area triggers within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current ControlZoneHandler object after the move operation
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'ControlZoneHandler handler1;

      ControlZoneHandler handler2 = std::move(handler1);

      // handler1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // handler2 contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which is more efficient than copy
    semantics when transferring ownership of resources. The source object after move
    assignment should not be used unless it's reassigned or destroyed. This method
    is typically generated automatically by the compiler for classes that support
    move semantics.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the right-hand side object becomes invalid
    and should not be accessed. Using the moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper initialization of objects after move operations.
