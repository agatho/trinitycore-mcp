  class: LevelBracket
  method: IsNaturalLeveling
  signature: bool LevelBracket::IsNaturalLeveling() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the level bracket represents a natural leveling range.
  description: The IsNaturalLeveling method checks if the current LevelBracket instance
    corresponds to a natural leveling progression, typically used in World of Warcraft's
    quest and experience systems. This flag is often utilized to determine how player
    levels should be adjusted or validated during quest completion, experience gain,
    or when evaluating whether certain game mechanics apply to a specific level range.
    The method returns true if the bracket defines a standard, expected leveling progression;
    otherwise, it returns false. This functionality is particularly important for
    handling edge cases in player progression and ensuring that game balance is maintained
    across different level ranges.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether this LevelBracket represents a natural
    leveling range. Returns true if the bracket defines a standard progression; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a LevelBracket is natural
    code: "LevelBracket bracket(10, 20);\nbool isNatural = bracket.IsNaturalLeveling();\n\
      if (isNatural)\n{\n    // Handle natural leveling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state or configuration data that defines
    what constitutes a 'natural' level progression. It may be used in conjunction
    with other bracket validation methods to ensure proper quest and experience handling.
