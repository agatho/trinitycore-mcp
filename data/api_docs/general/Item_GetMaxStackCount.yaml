documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum stack count allowed for this item type
  description: This method retrieves the maximum number of items that can be stacked
    in a single inventory slot for the current item. It is used to determine how many
    items of the same type can coexist in one stack, which affects gameplay mechanics
    such as item management, currency handling, and inventory space optimization.
    The value is determined by the item's template data and may vary based on item
    quality, type, and other factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum stack count allowed for this item type, typically ranging
    from 1 to 200 depending on item properties
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);

      uint32 maxStack = item->GetMaxStackCount();

      // maxStack will be 1 for non-stackable items, or higher for stackable items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other item methods like
    GetStackCount() to determine inventory capacity and item management. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method simply accesses cached data from the
    item's template.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining actual stack count during
    gameplay, as it only returns the maximum possible stack size; actual stack count
    may be lower due to item restrictions or player inventory constraints.
