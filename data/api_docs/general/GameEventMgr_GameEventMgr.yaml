  brief: Moves a GameEventMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    new instance.
  description: The GameEventMgr move constructor initializes a GameEventMgr object
    by transferring ownership of resources from an existing GameEventMgr object. This
    operation is typically used when passing or returning GameEventMgr objects by
    value in C++ code. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation
    and should not be used. This constructor is part of the standard C++ move semantics
    implementation for managing game event data structures within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move GameEventMgr to new variable
    code: 'GameEventMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with game events ...

      GameEventMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr);

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when the class
    supports move semantics. It's important to understand that after moving, the source
    object should not be used unless it's reassigned or explicitly reset.
