  class: CommandResponse
  method: GetText
  signature: std::string CommandResponse::GetText() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the text content stored within the CommandResponse object.
  description: The GetText method returns the string representation of the response
    text that has been set within a CommandResponse instance. This method is typically
    used in the context of handling game commands where a command handler may construct
    a response message and store it in a CommandResponse object for later retrieval
    or transmission to the client. The returned string can contain formatted messages,
    error descriptions, or any textual output relevant to the executed command. This
    method does not modify the internal state of the CommandResponse object and is
    safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the text content previously set in the CommandResponse
    object. If no text has been set, it will return an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.SetText("Player successfully added to group.");

      std::string text = response.GetText();

      // text now contains "Player successfully added to group."'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Command Handler Context
    code: "bool HandleAddMemberCommand(ChatHandler* handler, char const* args) {\n\
      \    // ... command logic ...\n    CommandResponse response;\n    response.SetText(\"\
      Member added successfully.\");\n    handler->SendSysMessage(response.GetText().c_str());\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a copy of the internal string data, so modifications
    to the returned string will not affect the original content stored in the CommandResponse
    object. The implementation assumes that the text has been properly initialized
    before calling GetText.
