  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateBurst
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateBurst(uint32 spellId, int
    * target, float damageModifier)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a prioritized burst action for the specified spell with optional
    target and damage modifier.
  description: The CreateBurst method generates a PrioritizedAction object designed
    to represent an immediate, high-priority spell cast or ability usage. This is
    typically used in AI decision-making systems where burst damage or critical actions
    need to be executed with priority over other potential actions. The method accepts
    a spell identifier, optional target reference, and a damage modifier to customize
    the action's behavior. It integrates with TrinityCore's action priority system
    to ensure proper execution order based on game state and player conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to be bursted. Must
      correspond to a valid spell in the game database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or GUID for the
      action. Can be NULL if no specific target is required.
  - name: damageModifier
    description: Floating-point value that modifies the base damage of the spell.
      Values greater than 1 increase damage, values less than 1 decrease it.
  returns: A PrioritizedAction object containing the configuration for the burst action
    including spell ID, target information, and damage modifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Burst Creation
    code: PrioritizedAction burst = ActionPriorityHelper::CreateBurst(12345, nullptr,
      1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Burst with Target and Modifier
    code: 'int targetGuid = 45678;

      PrioritizedAction burst = ActionPriorityHelper::CreateBurst(98765, &targetGuid,
      1.5f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use within AI modules and action priority
    lists. The returned PrioritizedAction should be added to an action queue or processed
    by the AI system's execution engine. Performance is optimized for frequent calls
    but may vary depending on how many actions are being prioritized simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the database, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. Using a null target pointer with spells requiring
    targets can lead to failed casts or unexpected AI behavior.
