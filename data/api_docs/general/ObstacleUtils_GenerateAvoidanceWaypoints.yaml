  method: GenerateAvoidanceWaypoints
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::GenerateAvoidanceWaypoints(const int & start, const
    int & goal, const int & obstacle, float avoidanceRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of waypoints to avoid an obstacle between a start and goal
    position.
  description: The GenerateAvoidanceWaypoints method calculates a series of intermediate
    waypoints that allow movement from a starting point to a goal point while avoiding
    a specified obstacle. This function is typically used in pathfinding algorithms
    for NPCs or units that need to navigate around static or dynamic obstacles in
    the game world. The method takes into account an avoidance radius to ensure safe
    distances from the obstacle during movement. It returns the number of waypoints
    generated, which can be zero if no valid path exists or if the start and goal
    are identical.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position identifier or index used in the waypoint system.
      This typically refers to a node or point in a navigation mesh or graph.
  - name: goal
    description: The destination position identifier or index used in the waypoint
      system. This represents the target node or point in the navigation mesh or graph.
  - name: obstacle
    description: The identifier or index of the obstacle that needs to be avoided.
      This could refer to a static object, dynamic unit, or other navigational barrier
      in the game world.
  - name: avoidanceRadius
    description: The radius around the obstacle that must be maintained during path
      generation. Must be a positive value; negative values may lead to undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of waypoints generated in the
    avoidance path. A return value of zero indicates either no valid path was found
    or the start and goal positions are the same. Negative values are not expected
    but may indicate error conditions if such cases are handled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle avoidance
    code: "int waypoints = ObstacleUtils::GenerateAvoidanceWaypoints(10, 20, 30, 5.0f);\n\
      if (waypoints > 0) {\n    // Proceed with using the generated waypoints\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"Generated \" << waypoints << \" waypoints\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // No path found or error occurred\n    std::cout << \"Failed\
      \ to generate waypoints\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using avoidance waypoints for AI movement
    code: "int startNode = 100;\nint goalNode = 200;\nint obstacleNode = 150;\nfloat\
      \ radius = 3.0f;\n\nint numWaypoints = ObstacleUtils::GenerateAvoidanceWaypoints(startNode,\
      \ goalNode, obstacleNode, radius);\nif (numWaypoints > 0) {\n    // Process\
      \ waypoints to move AI unit along path\n    for (int i = 0; i < numWaypoints;\
      \ ++i) {\n        // Move towards waypoint[i]\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the underlying navigation system has already been
    initialized and that all node identifiers are valid. The avoidance radius should
    be carefully tuned to balance between safe navigation and performance. For large
    avoidance radii, consider caching results or using approximation techniques to
    prevent excessive computation.
  warnings: Passing invalid node indices (e.g., out-of-bounds) may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the start and goal nodes are not identical unless
    explicitly supported by the implementation. Avoidance radius values of zero or
    negative numbers should be avoided as they can cause unexpected results in path
    generation.
