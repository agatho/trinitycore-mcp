documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and extracts movement patterns from player data for profiling and
    behavior analysis.
  description: The ExtractMovementPatterns method processes a player's movement data
    to identify and store recurring motion behaviors, such as walking speed, running
    patterns, jump frequencies, and directional changes. This functionality is typically
    used in player behavior analysis, anti-cheat systems, or performance optimization
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates on internal player state
    data and does not directly interact with the game world or other players. It is
    designed to be called during specific profiling phases or when movement data needs
    to be analyzed for statistical purposes.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Profiling
    code: 'PlayerProfile profile;

      profile.ExtractMovementPatterns();

      // Movement patterns are now stored internally for analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player movement data has already been collected
    and is available within the PlayerProfile instance. It may perform memory allocations
    to store extracted patterns, so frequent calls could impact performance in high-concurrency
    scenarios.
  warnings: The method does not validate input data before processing. If movement
    data is corrupted or incomplete, the results of pattern extraction may be inaccurate
    or cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that player data is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
