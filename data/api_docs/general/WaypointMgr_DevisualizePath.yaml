  class: WaypointMgr
  method: DevisualizePath
  signature: void WaypointMgr::DevisualizePath(Unit * owner, const WaypointPath *
    path)
documentation:
  brief: Removes visual waypoints from a unit's path.
  description: The DevisualizePath method removes all visual waypoints associated
    with a given waypoint path from the specified unit. This function is typically
    used to clean up visual markers that were previously displayed to indicate a unit's
    movement path, such as when a creature finishes following a path or when path
    visualization needs to be cleared. The method operates on the provided Unit object
    and the WaypointPath it is associated with, ensuring no visual representation
    remains for that path.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose waypoints are to be removed. This
      represents the entity (such as a creature) that was following or is associated
      with the waypoint path.
  - name: path
    description: Pointer to the WaypointPath object containing the waypoints to be
      devisualized. The path must be valid and previously associated with the owner
      unit for proper behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove visual waypoints from a creature
    code: 'Unit* creature = ...; // Get reference to a creature

      WaypointPath* path = ...; // Get reference to a waypoint path

      WaypointMgr::instance()->DevisualizePath(creature, path);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system when
    a unit completes or cancels a movement path. It does not modify the actual path
    data but only removes visual elements from the client.
