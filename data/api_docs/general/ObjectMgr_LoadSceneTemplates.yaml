documentation:
  brief: Loads scene template data from the database into memory for use in World
    of Warcraft world instances.
  description: The LoadSceneTemplates method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with scene template information retrieved from the database. This method
    is typically invoked during server startup or when scene templates need to be
    refreshed in memory. Scene templates define specific visual and functional aspects
    of world environments, such as quest scenes, cinematic sequences, or special event
    layouts. The method processes all available scene template entries, validates
    their integrity, and prepares them for runtime usage by the game engine. It ensures
    that all scene-related data is properly loaded before any player interactions
    involving scenes can occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSceneTemplates()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadSceneTemplates();\n\
      }\n\n// Called from main server initialization logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup sequence and should not
    be invoked repeatedly during runtime unless scene templates are dynamically updated.
    The method performs database queries to fetch scene template data, which may impact
    performance if there are many scene templates in the database. It's designed to
    be thread-safe as part of the ObjectMgr singleton initialization process.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and functional. If database queries fail, incomplete scene
    template data may be loaded, potentially causing runtime errors when scenes are
    attempted to be used.
