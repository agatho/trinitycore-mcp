  signature: void BotActionManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot action manager's internal state and registers all available
    bot actions.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the BotActionManager by loading and registering
    all supported bot actions into the system. This method is typically called during
    the server startup process or when a new bot instance is created. It ensures that
    the action manager has access to all defined actions and their associated data
    structures, making them available for bot decision-making processes. The initialization
    process may involve setting up action priorities, validating action configurations,
    and preparing internal lookup tables for efficient action retrieval. This method
    must be called before any bot can execute actions, as it establishes the foundation
    for bot behavior.

    code: 'BotActionManager actionManager;

      actionManager.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotActionManager
    instance. Re-initialization may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. The
    initialization process is typically blocking and may take some time depending
    on the number of registered actions.
