  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::ExecuteKiting(const KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes kiting behavior for a player based on the provided kiting context.
  description: The ExecuteKiting method performs the core logic of kiting, which is
    a movement strategy used in World of Warcraft to maintain distance from enemies
    while dealing damage. This method evaluates the current kiting context, including
    player position, target location, and environmental factors, to determine optimal
    movement patterns. It handles pathfinding, rotation adjustments, and distance
    management to ensure effective kiting behavior during combat. The method is typically
    invoked by AI systems or player action handlers to manage kiting mechanics automatically.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a KitingResult enum value indicating the outcome of the kiting
    execution. Possible values include SUCCESS if kiting was completed successfully,
    FAILED if the operation could not be performed due to invalid context or state,
    and IN_PROGRESS if the kiting behavior is still being executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic kiting execution
    code: "KitingContext context;\ncontext.player = player;\ncontext.target = target;\n\
      context.maxDistance = 30.0f;\ncontext.minDistance = 5.0f;\nKitingResult result\
      \ = kitingManager.ExecuteKiting(context);\nif (result == KitingResult::SUCCESS)\n\
      {\n    // Kiting completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on accurate positioning data and should only be
    called when the player and target are in valid states. The kiting context must
    contain proper initialization of all required fields to avoid undefined behavior.
    Performance may be affected by complex pathfinding calculations in crowded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initialized KitingContext can lead
    to crashes or incorrect kiting behavior. Ensure that the player and target are
    valid objects before invoking this method. Avoid calling ExecuteKiting repeatedly
    in tight loops as it may cause performance degradation.
