  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsDynamicObstructionActive
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsDynamicObstructionActive(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a dynamic obstruction with the specified GUID is currently
    active in the line of sight system.
  description: The IsDynamicObstructionActive method determines if a dynamic obstruction
    identified by its global unique identifier (GUID) is currently registered and
    active within the LineOfSightManager. Dynamic obstructions are temporary objects
    such as moving creatures, doors, or environmental effects that can block line
    of sight. This method is typically used during pathfinding or vision calculations
    to ensure accurate detection of whether an object is currently obstructing the
    view or movement path. The method performs a lookup in the internal tracking structure
    of active dynamic obstructions and returns true if the specified GUID corresponds
    to an active entry, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the dynamic obstruction to
      check for activity. This should be a valid object identifier from the game world.
  returns: Returns true if a dynamic obstruction with the specified GUID is currently
    active and registered in the line of sight system, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific dynamic obstruction is active
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.IsDynamicObstructionActive(12345)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where obstruction is active\n    std::cout << \"Obstruction is active\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle case where obstruction is not active\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Obstruction is not active\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state management of dynamic obstructions.
    It assumes that the GUID passed corresponds to a valid object in the game world
    and that the LineOfSightManager has been properly initialized with tracking data
    for dynamic objects.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided is valid and refers to an actual dynamic
    obstruction in the game world, as passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead
    to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
