  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: IsValidQueueId
  signature: bool BattlegroundMgr::IsValidQueueId(int bgQueueTypeId)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the specified battleground queue ID is valid and recognized
    by the system.
  description: The IsValidQueueId method checks if a given battleground queue type
    identifier is a valid and supported queue within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures that only predefined queue types, which are registered and configured
    for use in battlegrounds, are considered valid. It is commonly used during queue
    management operations to verify that a queue ID corresponds to an actual battleground
    or arena type that can be processed by the game server. The validation typically
    involves checking against internal data structures or configuration tables that
    define valid queue identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The integer identifier representing the battleground queue type to
      validate. This value corresponds to predefined queue types such as those for
      Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, etc., and must match a registered
      queue in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the provided bgQueueTypeId is a valid queue identifier
    recognized by the BattlegroundMgr; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (BattlegroundMgr::instance()->IsValidQueueId(BG_QUEUE_AV)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with queue operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Queue ID is valid\");\n\
      } else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Invalid queue ID\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in queue addition logic
    code: "uint32 queueId = 10; // Example queue type\nif (sBattlegroundMgr->IsValidQueueId(queueId))\
      \ {\n    Player* player = ...;\n    sBattlegroundMgr->AddPlayerToBGQueue(player,\
      \ queueId);\n} else {\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(LANG_BG_QUEUE_INVALID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal queue type registration and should not be
    used with arbitrary integers. The validity of a queue ID is determined by the
    game's configuration and registered battleground types at runtime.
