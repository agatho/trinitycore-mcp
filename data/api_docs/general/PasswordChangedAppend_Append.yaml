  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    structure for password change events.
  description: The PasswordChangedAppend::Append method is responsible for populating
    a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet with specific data related to a
    channel password change event. This method is typically invoked when a player
    changes the password of a channel they have access to, ensuring that the appropriate
    notification is sent to all affected channel members. The method modifies the
    provided packet in-place by adding relevant fields such as the channel name and
    the type of notification being sent. It operates within the TrinityCore framework's
    networking system and is part of the larger channel management subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel password change handler
    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      PasswordChangedAppend appendHandler;

      appendHandler.Append(notifyPacket);

      // The notifyPacket now contains the appropriate data for a password changed
      notification'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an internal class used by TrinityCore's channel system.
    It assumes that the caller has already validated the context in which it is invoked,
    such as ensuring that the current player actually changed the channel password.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input packet itself.
