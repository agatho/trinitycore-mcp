  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & NPCInteractionManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistics object containing interaction data for NPC interactions.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that holds aggregated data about NPC interactions. This includes
    metrics such as total interactions, successful transactions, and other relevant
    counters. The returned object is immutable, ensuring that external code cannot
    modify the internal state directly. This method is typically used for monitoring,
    debugging, or reporting purposes within the NPC interaction system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing all collected
    NPC interaction metrics and data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Print NPC Interaction Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = npcInteractionManager.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Interactions: " << stats.totalInteractions << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Successful Transactions: " << stats.successfulTransactions <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the current state and may
    not reflect real-time changes. The method is thread-safe as it only returns const
    references to internal data structures.
