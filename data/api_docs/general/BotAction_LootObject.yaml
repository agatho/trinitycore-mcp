  class: BotAction
  method: LootObject
  signature: BotAction BotAction::LootObject(int bot, int object, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates loot processing for a specified object by a bot at a given timestamp.
  description: The LootObject method is used to trigger the looting behavior of a
    bot for a specific game object, such as a corpse or container. It takes the bot's
    identifier, the object's identifier, and a timestamp to determine when the loot
    action should occur. This method is typically called within the context of AI
    decision-making logic where bots evaluate their environment and decide what to
    loot. The method returns a BotAction object that represents the initiated loot
    operation, which can be used for tracking or further manipulation of the bot's
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will perform the loot
      action.
  - name: object
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object to be looted, such
      as a corpse or container.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the loot action should take place.
      This is used for scheduling or timing purposes in the bot's AI logic.
  returns: Returns a BotAction object that represents the initiated loot operation,
    allowing further control or tracking of the bot's looting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic LootObject Usage
    code: BotAction action = botAction.LootObject(12345, 67890, 1678886400);
    language: cpp
  - title: LootObject with Dynamic Timestamp
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);

      BotAction action = botAction.LootObject(botGuid, objectGuid, currentTime + 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot AI system and assumes that both
    the bot and the target object exist in the game world. The timestamp parameter
    allows for delayed loot actions, which can be useful for simulating realistic
    behavior or coordinating with other AI actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and object GUIDs are valid before calling this method
    to prevent undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that the object must
    be loottable (e.g., a corpse or container) for the action to have any meaningful
    effect.
