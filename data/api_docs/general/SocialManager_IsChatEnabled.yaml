documentation:
  brief: Checks whether chat functionality is enabled for the player
  description: The IsChatEnabled method determines if a player's chat functionality
    is currently active or disabled. This check is typically used to prevent chat
    messages from being sent or received when the player has disabled chat features,
    such as when they have muted all chat channels or when certain game conditions
    disable communication. The method returns a boolean value indicating the current
    state of chat enablement for the player's session.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if chat is enabled for the player, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the player can send and receive chat messages in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chat Enablement Check
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->IsChatEnabled()) {\n    // Player can send chat\
      \ messages\n    player->Say(\"Hello, World!\");\n} else {\n    // Chat is disabled,\
      \ handle accordingly\n    player->SendNotification(\"Chat is currently disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or settings related to the player's
    chat preferences and game state. It may be used in conjunction with other social
    manager methods to control communication flow.
