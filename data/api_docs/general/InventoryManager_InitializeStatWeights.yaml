documentation:
  brief: Initializes stat weights for item evaluation and optimization within the
    inventory management system
  description: The InitializeStatWeights method sets up the statistical weight values
    used by the InventoryManager to evaluate and optimize item choices for players.
    This method typically configures how different statistics (such as strength, agility,
    intellect, etc.) are prioritized when determining the best items to equip or keep
    in inventory. It establishes the baseline weights that influence decision-making
    processes like auto-equipping, item comparison, and optimization recommendations.
    The method is usually called during player initialization or when loading saved
    character data to ensure proper stat evaluation logic is active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventoryMgr = player->GetInventory();

      inventoryMgr->InitializeStatWeights();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during player session initialization.
    The stat weights are often configurable through game settings or configuration
    files, and this method reads those values to set up internal evaluation parameters.
