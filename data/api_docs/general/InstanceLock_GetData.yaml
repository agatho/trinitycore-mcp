  class: InstanceLock
  method: GetData
  signature: const InstanceLockData * InstanceLock::GetData() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the instance lock data structure containing lock information
    for the current instance.
  description: The GetData method provides access to the internal InstanceLockData
    structure that holds all relevant information about an instance lock. This includes
    details such as the instance ID, lock status, expiration time, and associated
    player or group data. The returned pointer is const, ensuring that the lock data
    cannot be modified through this interface. This method is typically used by systems
    that need to query the current state of an instance lock without modifying it.
    The method assumes that the InstanceLock object has been properly initialized
    and contains valid lock data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the InstanceLockData structure, or nullptr if no valid
    lock data exists. The returned pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the InstanceLock
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ data = lock->GetData();\nif (data)\n{\n    // Access lock information\n  \
      \  uint32 instanceId = data->instanceId;\n    time_t expirationTime = data->expirationTime;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Lock Status
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ data = lock->GetData();\nif (data && data->isLocked)\n{\n    // Instance is\
      \ currently locked\n    sLog->outString(\"Instance %u is locked until %u\",\
      \ data->instanceId, data->expirationTime);\n}\nelse if (data)\n{\n    // Instance\
      \ is not locked\n    sLog->outString(\"Instance %u is not locked\", data->instanceId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned InstanceLockData pointer should never be modified directly.
    The const qualifier ensures this contract is maintained. This method does not
    perform any locking or synchronization internally, so callers should ensure thread
    safety if accessing from multiple threads. The lifetime of the returned data is
    tied to the InstanceLock object itself.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or delete the returned pointer as it points to
    internal data managed by the InstanceLock object. Accessing the returned pointer
    after the InstanceLock object has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
    Be aware that the data may be null if no lock information is currently available.
