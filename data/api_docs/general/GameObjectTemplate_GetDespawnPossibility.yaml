  method: GetDespawnPossibility
  signature: bool GameObjectTemplate::GetDespawnPossibility() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the game object has a chance to despawn based on its template
    settings.
  description: The GetDespawnPossibility method determines if a GameObject instance
    derived from this template has a non-zero probability of despawning. This value
    is typically set during the GameObject's creation and depends on the template
    configuration, such as whether the object is designed to be temporary or persistent.
    The returned boolean indicates whether the object's despawn behavior is enabled
    according to its definition in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the game object has a possibility of
    despawning. Returns true if the object can despawn, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject Can Despawn
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->GetDespawnPossibility()) {\n    // This game object\
      \ can despawn\n    printf(\"This object may despawn.\\n\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ This game object will not despawn\n    printf(\"This object will remain.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the GameObjectTemplate's internal configuration, which
    is usually loaded from the `gameobject_template` table in the database. The despawn
    possibility may be influenced by flags or fields like 'despawn_time' or 'spawn_condition'.
