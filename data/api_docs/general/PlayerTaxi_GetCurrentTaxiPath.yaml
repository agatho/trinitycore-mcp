  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: GetCurrentTaxiPath
  signature: uint32 PlayerTaxi::GetCurrentTaxiPath() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the current taxi path the player is using.
  description: The GetCurrentTaxiPath method returns the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the active taxi path that the player is currently traveling on. This value
    corresponds to the entry in the `taxi_path` table within the TrinityCore database,
    and it's used internally by the game engine to manage taxi route states, such
    as tracking progress along a path, determining destination nodes, and handling
    path completion events. The method does not perform any validation or state checks;
    it simply returns the stored path GUID from the player's internal taxi state.
    This identifier is essential for maintaining synchronization between client and
    server regarding taxi travel progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the current taxi path.
    If the player is not currently on a taxi path, this will return 0, indicating
    no active taxi route.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player is on Taxi Path
    code: "uint32 currentPath = player->GetTaxi().GetCurrentTaxiPath();\nif (currentPath\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Player is currently traveling on a taxi path\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is on taxi path ID: %u\", currentPath);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ not on any taxi path\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is not on a taxi path.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Path ID for Conditional Logic
    code: "uint32 pathId = player->GetTaxi().GetCurrentTaxiPath();\nswitch (pathId)\n\
      {\n    case 1001:\n        // Special handling for path to Stormwind\n     \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Player is traveling to Stormwind.\");\n        break;\n\
      \    case 1002:\n        // Special handling for path to Orgrimmar\n       \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Player is traveling to Orgrimmar.\");\n        break;\n\
      \    default:\n        sLog->outString(\"Player is on a standard taxi route.\"\
      );\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal player state related to taxi travel and should
    only be called when the player object is valid. The returned path ID directly
    maps to entries in the `taxi_path` database table, making it useful for custom
    logic or debugging purposes. Note that this value may change during flight transitions
    or upon reaching destinations.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value means the player has completed
    their taxi journey; it only indicates they are currently traveling on a path.
    Also, be cautious when modifying taxi state externally, as this can lead to inconsistent
    client-server states if not handled properly.
