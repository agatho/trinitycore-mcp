  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: TrackRareSpawn
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::TrackRareSpawn(Creature * rare)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks a rare creature spawn for behavior management and logging purposes.
  description: The TrackRareSpawn method is used to register and monitor the spawning
    of rare creatures within the game world. This functionality allows the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    to maintain an internal registry of rare spawns, which can be utilized for various
    AI behaviors, quest tracking, or event management. The method typically updates
    internal data structures to reflect the presence of a rare creature, enabling
    other systems to respond appropriately when such creatures are encountered or
    removed from the game world. It is commonly invoked during creature spawn events
    or when a rare creature's existence needs to be tracked for mission-critical gameplay
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: rare
    description: A pointer to the Creature object representing the rare spawn to be
      tracked. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid creature
      instance that has been successfully spawned in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rare Spawn Tracking
    code: "void OnCreatureSpawn(Creature* rare)\n{\n    if (rare && rare->IsRare())\n\
      \    {\n        m_advancedBehaviorManager.TrackRareSpawn(rare);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Rare Spawn with Additional Logic
    code: "void HandleRareSpawn(Creature* rare)\n{\n    if (rare && rare->IsRare())\n\
      \    {\n        // Log the spawn event\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Rare creature %s spawned at %u, %u\", \n                      rare->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ \n                      rare->GetPositionX(), \n                      rare->GetPositionY());\n\
      \        \n        // Track the rare spawn for behavior management\n       \
      \ m_advancedBehaviorManager.TrackRareSpawn(rare);\n        \n        // Trigger\
      \ additional event logic\n        ProcessRareSpawnEvent(rare);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Creature pointer is valid and represents
    a rare creature. It does not perform any validation on whether the creature is
    actually rare; it simply tracks its existence. The tracking mechanism may involve
    updating internal lists, maps, or counters within AdvancedBehaviorManager. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account if many rare creatures are spawned
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or a crash. Ensure that the Creature pointer is valid and points to an
    actual creature instance before calling this method. Also, avoid calling this
    method multiple times for the same creature without proper cleanup logic, as it
    may lead to duplicate tracking entries.
