  class: HotStreakTracker
  method: IsHotStreakActive
  signature: bool HotStreakTracker::IsHotStreakActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the hot streak effect is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsHotStreakActive method determines if a player currently has the
    hot streak buff applied. This buff typically increases the critical strike chance
    of certain spells for a limited duration. The method returns true if the hot streak
    effect is active and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this would usually involve checking the player's aura application state or buff
    stack count related to the hot streak mechanic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hot streak effect is currently active on the player,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetHotStreakTracker()->IsHotStreakActive()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ hot streak bonus effects\n    player->ModifySpellCritChance(5.0f); // Example\
      \ bonus\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Processing
    code: "void Player::HandleFireballSpell(SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    if\
      \ (GetHotStreakTracker()->IsHotStreakActive()) {\n        // Hot streak increases\
      \ critical strike chance\n        SetSpellCritChance(GetSpellCritChance() +\
      \ 10.0f);\n        // Execute spell logic\n        CastSpell(spellInfo);\n \
      \       // Reset crit chance after execution\n        SetSpellCritChance(GetSpellCritChance()\
      \ - 10.0f);\n    } else {\n        CastSpell(spellInfo);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal aura state or buff tracking mechanisms
    within the HotStreakTracker class. It's designed to be called frequently during
    spell processing, so performance should be optimized. The hot streak effect typically
    has a short duration and may stack with other critical strike buffs.
  warnings: Do not assume that this method will always return consistent results if
    called outside of spell execution contexts. The hot streak state might change
    between calls if the player's buff stack is modified by other effects or abilities.
