documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SafeExecutionEngine class for managing
    safe code execution contexts.
  description: The SafeExecutionEngine constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SafeExecutionEngine class, which is designed to provide a controlled environment
    for executing code blocks with built-in error handling and resource management.
    This engine is typically used within TrinityCore's core systems to ensure that
    potentially unsafe or unstable code executions do not crash the entire server
    process. It manages execution contexts, handles exceptions gracefully, and provides
    mechanisms for logging and recovery during code execution. The constructor sets
    up internal state tracking and prepares the engine for subsequent safe execution
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SafeExecutionEngine Initialization
    code: 'SafeExecutionEngine engine;

      // Engine is now ready to execute code safely'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SafeExecutionEngine in a Server Context
    code: "class MyModule\n{\npublic:\n    void ExecuteSafely()\n    {\n        SafeExecutionEngine\
      \ engine;\n        // Perform safe execution operations here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    The actual execution context management occurs during method calls rather than
    construction. Developers should be aware that SafeExecutionEngine is typically
    used in conjunction with other methods like Execute() or Run() to actually perform
    safe code execution.
  warnings: Do not assume that the engine is immediately ready for execution after
    construction. The engine requires specific execution methods to be called for
    actual safe execution behavior. Calling this constructor alone does not activate
    any safety mechanisms.
