  class: PoolObject
  method: PoolObject
  signature: void PoolObject::PoolObject(uint64 _guid, float _chance)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PoolObject with the specified GUID and chance values.
  description: The PoolObject constructor initializes a pool object with a unique
    identifier (GUID) and a chance value. This method sets up the internal state of
    the object, which is typically used in loot systems or random spawning mechanisms
    within TrinityCore. The GUID identifies the specific item or entity, while the
    chance represents the probability of this object being selected during a pool
    selection process. This constructor is usually called internally by the pooling
    system when creating new entries in a pool.
  parameters:
  - name: _guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) for the object. This value identifies
      the specific item or entity within the game world.
  - name: _chance
    description: The probability chance value for this object in a pool selection.
      Typically a float between 0.0 and 100.0, where higher values indicate higher
      likelihood of selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PoolObject Initialization
    code: PoolObject item(123456789ULL, 5.0f); // Creates a pool object with GUID
      123456789 and 5% chance
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple PoolObjects for Loot System
    code: 'std::vector<PoolObject> lootPool;

      lootPool.emplace_back(987654321ULL, 2.5f);

      lootPool.emplace_back(112233445ULL, 10.0f);

      lootPool.emplace_back(556677889ULL, 0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by game developers but
    rather through the pool management system. The chance value should be carefully
    considered in relation to other objects in the same pool to maintain proper loot
    distribution balance.
  warnings: Ensure that GUID values are unique within a given pool context to avoid
    conflicts. Incorrect chance values can lead to unexpected loot distributions or
    spawn behaviors.
