  method: ~StrategyFactory
  signature: void StrategyFactory::~StrategyFactory()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the StrategyFactory instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~StrategyFactory destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all memory and resources allocated by the StrategyFactory class. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated strategy objects, clearing internal data structures,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the factory object goes out of scope.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor ensures that AI strategies
    and their associated data are properly deallocated, preventing resource exhaustion
    during server runtime or shutdown. The method is automatically invoked by the
    C++ runtime when a StrategyFactory instance is destroyed.

  - title: Automatic destruction of StrategyFactory
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    StrategyFactory factory;\n    // Use factory...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when factory goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references
    to strategies created by this factory after destruction, as accessing such dangling
    pointers could lead to undefined behavior.
