documentation:
  brief: Updates the unphased flag state for the phase shift manager.
  description: The UpdateUnphasedFlag method is responsible for recalculating and
    synchronizing the unphased state of a PhaseShift object. This typically occurs
    when phase changes or player status updates happen within the game world. The
    method ensures that the internal flag representing whether an object is in an
    unphased state (i.e., visible in all phases) is correctly maintained. It may be
    invoked automatically by the core systems during phase transitions or manually
    by scripts and modules that manipulate phase states.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      phaseShift.UpdateUnphasedFlag();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal phase masks and visibility systems.
    It should be called after any modification to the phase data to maintain consistency
    in object visibility across different game phases.
