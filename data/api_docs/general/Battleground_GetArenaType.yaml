documentation:
  brief: Returns the arena type identifier for the battleground
  description: The GetArenaType method retrieves the specific arena type associated
    with the battleground instance. This integer value corresponds to predefined arena
    brackets used in World of Warcraft's competitive play systems. The method is typically
    used to determine the format of the arena match, such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5, which
    affects gameplay mechanics, scoring, and rewards. The returned value directly
    maps to the ArenaType enum or similar internal constants within TrinityCore's
    battleground system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the arena type identifier. Common values include
    0 for 2v2, 1 for 3v3, and 2 for 5v5 arenas. Returns -1 if the battleground is
    not an arena type.
  examples:
  - title: Check Arena Type
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player->GetBattlegroundId());\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    int arenaType = bg->GetArenaType();\n    if (arenaType == 0)\
      \ {\n        // This is a 2v2 arena\n    } else if (arenaType == 1) {\n    \
      \    // This is a 3v3 arena\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on battleground instances that are confirmed
    to be arena types. Calling it on non-arena battlegrounds may return unexpected
    values or -1. The arena type is set during battleground creation and remains constant
    throughout the match duration.
  warnings: Do not assume that all battlegrounds returned by GetBattleground() are
    arenas. Always verify the battleground type before calling this method to avoid
    incorrect behavior or access violations.
