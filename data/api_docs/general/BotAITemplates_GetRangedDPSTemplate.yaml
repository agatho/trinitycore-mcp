documentation:
  brief: Returns the configured BotAI template for ranged damage-dealing bots.
  description: The GetRangedDPSTemplate method retrieves a pre-defined BotAIConfig
    object that specifies the behavior and decision-making logic for bot characters
    assigned to perform ranged damage-dealing roles. This template includes settings
    such as spell selection, targeting priorities, movement patterns, and combat strategies
    tailored specifically for ranged DPS bots. The returned configuration is typically
    used by the AI system to initialize or reset a bot's behavior when it is designated
    as a ranged damage dealer within a group or raid context. This method does not
    modify any internal state of the BotAITemplates class; it simply provides access
    to a predefined template configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing the settings and rules for how a bot should
    behave when acting as a ranged damage dealer in World of Warcraft using the TrinityCore
    framework. The returned configuration may include spell priorities, target selection
    criteria, movement behaviors, and other AI-related parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Apply Ranged DPS Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig rangedDPSConfig = botAITemplates.GetRangedDPSTemplate();

      // Apply the configuration to a bot instance

      bot->SetAIConfig(rangedDPSConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAITemplates class has been properly initialized
    with predefined configurations for different bot roles. The returned BotAIConfig
    object should be treated as read-only to avoid unintended side effects in the
    AI system.
