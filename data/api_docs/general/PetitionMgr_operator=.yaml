documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a PetitionMgr object to another PetitionMgr instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for the PetitionMgr class transfers all
    resources and state from the source PetitionMgr object to the target object. This
    operation is typically used when reassigning a PetitionMgr instance to another,
    allowing efficient resource management by transferring ownership rather than copying
    data. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move
    operation. In the context of TrinityCore's petition system, this method supports
    efficient handling of petition-related data structures during object lifecycle
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target PetitionMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'PetitionMgr manager1;

      PetitionMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move assignment operator

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should only
    be used with rvalue references. The moved-from object must not be accessed after
    the operation, as it's left in a valid but unspecified state.
