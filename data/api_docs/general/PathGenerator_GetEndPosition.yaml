  method: GetEndPosition
  signature: const int & PathGenerator::GetEndPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the end position of the generated path.
  description: The GetEndPosition method retrieves the final destination coordinate
    of a path that has been calculated by the PathGenerator. This method is typically
    used after a pathfinding operation has completed to determine where the path leads.
    The returned value represents the final point in the path's coordinate system,
    which can be used for navigation or validation purposes. The method does not perform
    any path calculation itself; it simply returns the precomputed end position of
    an already generated path.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the end position of the
    path. This value typically corresponds to a coordinate in the game world's coordinate
    system, indicating where the path terminates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has been initialized and a path calculated

      const int& endPos = pathGen.GetEndPosition();

      std::cout << "Path ends at position: " << endPos << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Check
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\n// Assume pathGen has been initialized and a path\
      \ calculated\nconst int& endPos = pathGen.GetEndPosition();\nif (endPos != 0)\
      \ {\n    // Path is valid and has an end position\n    printf(\"Path ends at:\
      \ %d\\n\", endPos);\n} else {\n    // No valid end position, path may not have\
      \ been generated\n    printf(\"No valid end position found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying of
    the integer value. The returned reference is only valid as long as the PathGenerator
    object exists and its path data remains unchanged. If the path has not been generated
    or is invalid, the behavior of this method may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the PathGenerator object has a valid path before calling this
    method. Calling GetEndPosition on an uninitialized or invalid path generator may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect values. The returned reference should
    not be stored beyond the lifetime of the PathGenerator object.
