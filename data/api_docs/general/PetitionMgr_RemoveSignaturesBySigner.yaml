documentation:
  brief: Removes all signatures associated with a specified signer from the petition
    system.
  description: The RemoveSignaturesBySigner method removes all petition signatures
    linked to a given player identifier (signerGuid) from the petition management
    system. This function is typically used when a player revokes their signature
    on a petition or when a player's account is removed from the system. The method
    iterates through all petitions in the system and eliminates any entries where
    the signerGuid matches the provided parameter. It ensures data consistency by
    cleaning up related signature records without affecting other petition data or
    signatures from different signers.
  parameters:
  - name: signerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose signatures are to
      be removed from all petitions. This value should correspond to a valid player
      account in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Signatures for a Specific Player
    code: 'PetitionMgr::instance()->RemoveSignaturesBySigner(12345);

      // Removes all signatures by player with GUID 12345 from all petitions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Account Deletion Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerAccountDeleted(uint32 accountId)\n{\n    // Convert account\
      \ ID to player GUID\n    uint32 playerGuid = ObjectMgr::GetPlayerGUIDByAccountId(accountId);\n\
      \    if (playerGuid)\n    {\n        PetitionMgr::instance()->RemoveSignaturesBySigner(playerGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations to clean up signature records. It
    should be called carefully during account deletions or when handling player data
    removal to maintain system integrity. The implementation may involve iterating
    through all petitions in the system, which could have performance implications
    for servers with a large number of petitions.
  warnings: Calling this method will permanently remove all petition signatures associated
    with the specified signer. Ensure that the signerGuid is valid and represents
    an actual player before calling this function to avoid unintended data loss or
    corruption.
