  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: TrainPredictionModel
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::TrainPredictionModel(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Trains a machine learning model to predict market prices for the specified
    item ID.
  description: The TrainPredictionModel method initializes and executes the training
    process for a predictive model that forecasts item prices within the game's economy.
    This function likely processes historical auction data, market trends, and item
    characteristics to build or update a model capable of estimating future price
    movements. The trained model can then be used by other methods in the MarketAnalysis
    class to provide price predictions or recommendations. This method is typically
    invoked when new market data becomes available or when periodic retraining is
    required to maintain prediction accuracy.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the prediction model
      will be trained. Must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.TrainPredictionModel(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Training Multiple Items
    code: "MarketAnalysis analysis;\nstd::vector<uint32> itemIds = {12345, 67890,\
      \ 54321};\nfor (uint32 id : itemIds) {\n    analysis.TrainPredictionModel(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive and could block the calling
    thread during execution. It is recommended to run this operation asynchronously
    or during low-traffic periods to avoid performance degradation. The training process
    likely requires sufficient historical auction data to produce meaningful predictions.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId (e.g., one that does not exist
    in the game database) may result in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that
    item IDs are validated before calling this function.
