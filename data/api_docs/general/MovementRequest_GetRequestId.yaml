  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetRequestId
  signature: uint64 MovementRequest::GetRequestId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique request identifier associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetRequestId method returns a 64-bit unsigned integer that uniquely
    identifies this specific movement request within the TrinityCore framework. This
    identifier is typically used for tracking, logging, and correlating movement-related
    actions across different systems. The request ID is generated when the MovementRequest
    object is created and remains constant throughout its lifetime. It serves as a
    key for associating movement commands with their corresponding responses or events
    in the game's networking and AI systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique identifier of this movement request.
    This ID is guaranteed to be unique within the context of active movement requests
    and can be used to distinguish between different movement operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      uint64 requestId = request.GetRequestId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Movement request ID: %llu", requestId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Movement Requests
    code: "void HandlePlayerMove(Player* player, MovementRequest& request)\n{\n  \
      \  uint64 requestId = request.GetRequestId();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\"\
      , \"Processing movement request %llu for player %s\", requestId, player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    // Process movement logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The request ID is typically generated using a global counter or timestamp-based
    mechanism to ensure uniqueness. This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable
    data members of the MovementRequest object.
