  class: WorldSession
  method: SetPlayer
  signature: void WorldSession::SetPlayer(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player object associated with this session, linking the session
    to a specific in-game character.
  description: The SetPlayer method assigns a Player object to the current WorldSession,
    effectively linking the network session to a specific in-game character. This
    method is typically called during the login process when a player successfully
    authenticates and their character data is loaded. The session will then use this
    player reference for all subsequent game operations, including sending packets,
    processing commands, and managing the player's state. It ensures that all actions
    performed through this session are attributed to the correct player character
    within the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Setting Player During Login
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      // ... load player data ...

      worldSession->SetPlayer(player);

      // Session now linked to the player object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per session during the login sequence.
    Multiple calls may result in memory leaks or undefined behavior if not handled
    properly. The Player object passed must be valid and fully initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Never call SetPlayer with a null pointer as it will likely cause crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object remains valid for the lifetime
    of the session, as no automatic cleanup is performed by this method.
