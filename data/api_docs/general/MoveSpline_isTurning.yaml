  class: MoveSpline
  method: isTurning
  signature: bool MoveSpline::isTurning() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spline movement is currently executing a turn.
  description: The isTurning() method checks if the MoveSpline object is currently
    processing a turning action as part of its movement path. This typically occurs
    when the entity controlled by the spline needs to change direction during movement,
    such as when navigating around obstacles or following a complex path. The method
    returns true if the spline is in the middle of a turn, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining proper animation states and ensuring
    that turning actions are correctly synchronized with visual movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spline is currently executing a turn; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Movement is Turning
    code: "if (player->GetMoveSpline()->isTurning()) {\n    // Handle turning logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player is currently turning\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement state management
    to ensure that animations and visual effects are properly synchronized with the
    actual movement path. It's important to note that turning may occur at any point
    during spline execution, not just at waypoints.
