  signature: bool FactionEntry::CanHaveReputation() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the faction entry can have reputation associated with
    it.
  description: The CanHaveReputation method checks if a faction entry is eligible
    to have reputation values assigned to it. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    faction system to determine whether a player or NPC can gain or lose reputation
    with a specific faction. The method evaluates internal flags and properties of
    the FactionEntry to decide if reputation mechanics should be applied. It is commonly
    called during reputation updates, faction checks, or when determining if a faction
    interaction is valid within the game's logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the faction entry can have reputation associated with it;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    faction is either invalid, hidden, or not intended to participate in reputation
    systems.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Faction Can Have Reputation
    code: "FactionEntry const* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (faction\
      \ && faction->CanHaveReputation()) {\n    // Proceed with reputation logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Faction can have reputation\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Faction\
      \ cannot have reputation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal faction flags and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical code paths. It is recommended to cache the result if the
    check is performed frequently for the same faction entry.
