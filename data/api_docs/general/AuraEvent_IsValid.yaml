documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the AuraEvent object is in a consistent and usable state
  description: The IsValid method checks if the AuraEvent instance has been properly
    initialized and is in a valid state for use. This method typically verifies internal
    data structures, ensures required fields are populated, and confirms that the
    aura event hasn't been corrupted or prematurely destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    spell and aura system, this validation helps prevent accessing invalid aura events
    that could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The method is commonly used
    before performing operations on an aura event to ensure its integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AuraEvent object is valid and can be safely used; returns
    false if the object is in an invalid state, such as being uninitialized, destroyed,
    or corrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "AuraEvent* event = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (event && event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to use the aura event\n    event->ApplyEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Crash Scenarios
    code: "AuraEvent* event = unit->GetAura(67890);\nif (event && event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Perform aura-related operations\n    if (event->IsExpired()) {\n\
      \        unit->RemoveAura(event);\n    }\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid aura\
      \ event case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid aura event detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a lightweight check that examines
    internal flags or pointers rather than performing heavy validation. It's designed
    to be called frequently during gameplay without significant performance impact.
    The implementation may vary depending on how the AuraEvent class manages its lifecycle
    and state.
  warnings: Calling methods on an invalid AuraEvent can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate before using aura event objects, especially when dealing
    with spell effects or aura applications that might occur during combat or rapid
    player actions.
