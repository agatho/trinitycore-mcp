  class: GameObject
  method: GetLabels
  signature: int GameObject::GetLabels() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the label identifier of the GameObject for use in quest and game
    event systems.
  description: The GetLabels method retrieves the label identifier associated with
    a GameObject, which is used to determine the object's role in quest systems, game
    events, and other game mechanics. This identifier typically corresponds to a specific
    label or group of labels that define how the GameObject should be handled during
    quest completion or event activation. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with quest scripts and game event handlers to ensure proper object interaction
    and tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the label identifier of the GameObject,
    which can be used for matching against specific labels in quest conditions or
    game events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int label = gameObject->GetLabels();\nif (label == 12345) {\n    // Handle\
      \ object as part of a specific quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    like GetGoType() or GetGoInfo() to determine the full context of how an object
    should be handled during quest progression. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in combination with quest scripts,
    as incorrect label matching can lead to improper quest completion or event activation.
    Ensure that label values match those defined in the database.
