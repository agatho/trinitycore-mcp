  signature: void WorldSession::HandleMailCreateTextItem(WorldPackets::Mail::MailCreateTextItem
    & createTextItem)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a request to create a text-based item for mailing in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleMailCreateTextItem method handles incoming client requests
    to generate a text-based item for use in the mail system. This typically occurs
    when a player attempts to attach a written note or message to a mail item, which
    is then stored as a text-based item within the mailbox. The method validates the
    request and prepares the necessary data structures for the text item to be included
    in the mail transaction. It ensures that the player's input is properly formatted
    and meets the requirements for text-based mail attachments.
  parameters:
  - name: createTextItem
    description: A packet containing the details of the text item to be created, including
      the message content and any associated metadata required for mail system processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in mail creation flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMailCreateTextItem(WorldPackets::Mail::MailCreateTextItem&\
      \ createTextItem)\n{\n    // Validate packet data\n    if (!createTextItem.Message.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        // Process text item creation for mail\n        MailItem* mailItem\
      \ = new MailItem();\n        mailItem->SetMessage(createTextItem.Message);\n\
      \        // Add to player's mail system\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the mail system's internal processing and should only
    be invoked during active mail creation sessions. The method assumes proper client-side
    validation has already occurred before packet transmission.
  warnings: Improper handling of the text item data may lead to invalid mail attachments
    or server-side errors. Ensure all message content is sanitized to prevent injection
    attacks or excessive memory usage.
