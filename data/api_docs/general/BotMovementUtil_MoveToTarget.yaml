  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: MoveToTarget
  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::MoveToTarget(int * bot, int * target, int pointId,
    float minDistanceChange)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a bot towards a specified target at a given point ID with minimum distance
    change threshold.
  description: 'The MoveToTarget method instructs a bot to navigate toward a designated
    target using pathfinding and movement logic. It utilizes a point identifier to
    determine the specific location or waypoint to move towards, ensuring that the
    bot maintains a minimum distance change from its previous position during movement.
    This method is commonly used in automated bot behavior systems for controlling
    NPC or player-controlled bots within the TrinityCore framework. The function returns
    true if the movement process was initiated successfully, and false otherwise.
    Precondition: Both bot and target must be valid entities with valid identifiers.
    Postcondition: The bot''s movement state will reflect the new destination unless
    an error occurs.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot entity identifier (int*) that will perform the
      movement action.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity identifier (int*) towards which the
      bot will move.
  - name: pointId
    description: Integer identifier representing a specific point or waypoint in the
      navigation system where the bot should move.
  - name: minDistanceChange
    description: Float value specifying the minimum distance threshold (in yards)
      that must be exceeded for the movement to be considered effective.
  returns: True if the bot successfully begins moving toward the target at the specified
    point ID with sufficient distance change; false otherwise.

    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint targetId = 67890;\nint pointId = 5;\nfloat minDist\
      \ = 2.0f;\nbool success = BotMovementUtil::MoveToTarget(&botId, &targetId, pointId,\
      \ minDist);\nif (success) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n}"

    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint targetId = 67890;\nint pointId = 10;\nfloat minDist\
      \ = 1.5f;\n\nif (BotMovementUtil::MoveToTarget(&botId, &targetId, pointId, minDist))\
      \ {\n    // Movement initiated\n    printf(\"Bot started moving to target at\
      \ point %d\\n\", pointId);\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate movement\n \
      \   printf(\"Failed to move bot to target\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore AI and pathfinding systems.
    Ensure that both bot and target entities are valid before calling this function.
    The minDistanceChange parameter helps prevent unnecessary movement updates when
    bots are already close to their destination.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers for bot or target may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate entity identifiers before
    invoking MoveToTarget.
