  class: LootDistribution
  method: GetGroupLootMetrics
  signature: LootMetrics LootDistribution::GetGroupLootMetrics(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves loot distribution metrics for a specified group within the game
    world.
  description: The GetGroupLootMetrics method fetches detailed statistics and performance
    data related to how loot is distributed among players in a specific group. This
    includes information such as total items looted, average roll times, distribution
    efficiency, and other relevant metrics that help track group loot behavior. The
    method operates on the internal loot distribution system of TrinityCore, providing
    insights into gameplay mechanics like fairness, timing, and resource allocation
    within grouped encounters. It is typically used for administrative purposes, performance
    analysis, or in-game reporting systems where tracking group-based loot patterns
    is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootMetrics object containing structured data about the group's loot
    distribution, including counts, averages, and timing statistics relevant to how
    items were awarded within that group context.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Loot Metrics for Group
    code: "LootMetrics metrics = lootDistribution.GetGroupLootMetrics(12345);\nif\
      \ (metrics.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Total items looted: \" << metrics.TotalItems()\
      \ << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Average roll time: \" << metrics.AverageRollTime()\
      \ << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group ID provided corresponds to an active group
    in the current game session. The returned LootMetrics object should be validated
    for validity before accessing its fields, as invalid or uninitialized data may
    result from non-existent groups or incorrect IDs.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent group ID may return undefined
    behavior or invalid metrics. Always verify that the group exists and is currently
    engaged in loot distribution before invoking this function.
