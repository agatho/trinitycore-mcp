  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: CalculateActionScore
  signature: float CombatBehaviorIntegration::CalculateActionScore(const RecommendedAction
    & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a numerical score representing the desirability of
    executing a recommended combat action.
  description: The CalculateActionScore method assesses a given RecommendedAction
    object to determine its relative priority or effectiveness within the current
    combat context. This method is typically used by AI decision-making systems to
    rank potential actions and select the most optimal one. The score is calculated
    based on various factors such as threat level, target vulnerability, action efficiency,
    and situational relevance. It serves as a core component in the combat behavior
    integration system that drives NPC and player character decision-making during
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: A const reference to a RecommendedAction object containing the action
      details to be scored. This includes information about the intended target, action
      type, and associated combat parameters.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated score for the given action. Higher
    scores indicate more desirable or effective actions. The exact range and interpretation
    of scores may vary based on implementation details and context-specific weighting
    factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float score = combatBehavior->CalculateActionScore(recommendedAction);\n\
      if (score > 0.8f) {\n    // Execute high-priority action\n    ExecuteAction(recommendedAction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Action Scoring in Decision Logic
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nRecommendedAction bestAction;\nfor (const auto&\
      \ action : possibleActions) {\n    float score = combatBehavior->CalculateActionScore(action);\n\
      \    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestAction\
      \ = action;\n    }\n}\nif (bestScore > 0.5f) {\n    ExecuteAction(bestAction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat decision cycles,
    so performance optimization is important. The scoring algorithm may incorporate
    real-time combat data such as health percentages, cooldown states, and positional
    information. The implementation should remain consistent across different AI contexts
    to ensure predictable behavior.
  warnings: The returned score values are relative and context-dependent. Values may
    vary significantly between different combat scenarios or character classes. Ensure
    that the input RecommendedAction object is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
