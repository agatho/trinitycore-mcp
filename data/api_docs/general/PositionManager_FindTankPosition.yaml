  class: PositionManager
  method: FindTankPosition
  signature: int PositionManager::FindTankPosition(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the optimal position for a tank unit relative to the target.
  description: The FindTankPosition method determines the best positional location
    for a tank unit in relation to a specified target. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven combat scenarios where positioning plays a critical role in maintaining
    threat, managing aggro, or optimizing damage output. It evaluates various factors
    such as distance, angle, and environmental constraints to calculate an ideal tank
    position. The method assumes that the target has been previously set within the
    PositionManager context and returns an integer identifier representing the calculated
    position index.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the index of the calculated optimal tank
    position. A return value of -1 indicates failure to compute a valid position,
    possibly due to invalid target state or insufficient data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int tankPos = positionManager.FindTankPosition(targetUnit);\nif (tankPos\
      \ != -1) {\n    // Proceed with movement or action using the calculated position\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive depending on the complexity
    of positional calculations. It is recommended to cache results when possible to
    avoid repeated evaluations during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and in a state where positioning
    logic can be applied; otherwise, the method will return -1 without performing
    any meaningful computation.
