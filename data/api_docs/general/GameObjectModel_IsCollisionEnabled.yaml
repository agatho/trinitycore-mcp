  signature: bool GameObjectModel::IsCollisionEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether collision detection is enabled for the game object model.
  description: The IsCollisionEnabled method determines if collision detection is
    currently active for this GameObjectModel instance. This flag controls whether
    the model participates in physics-based collision checks with other objects in
    the game world. When enabled, the model will interact with players, creatures,
    and other objects through collision detection. The method returns a boolean value
    indicating the current state of the collision enable flag. This functionality
    is crucial for determining how game objects behave in terms of physical interactions
    within the TrinityCore engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if collision detection is enabled for this GameObjectModel,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the model will participate
    in collision checks with other objects in the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Check
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = ...;\nif (model->IsCollisionEnabled()) {\n   \
      \ // Handle case where collision is enabled\n    printf(\"Collision is enabled\
      \ for this object\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case where collision is disabled\n\
      \    printf(\"Collision is disabled for this object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Collision State
    code: "void ProcessGameObject(GameObject* go) {\n    if (go->GetGOModel()) {\n\
      \        GameObjectModel* model = go->GetGOModel();\n        if (model->IsCollisionEnabled())\
      \ {\n            // Perform collision-aware operations\n            go->SetFlag(GO_FLAG_NO_INTERACT);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Handle non-collision object\n            go->RemoveFlag(GO_FLAG_NO_INTERACT);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GameObjectModel::SetCollisionEnabled()
    to control the collision behavior of game objects dynamically. The state of this
    flag can be modified at runtime, affecting how objects interact with the physics
    engine and other entities in the world.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying collision states during active gameplay as
    it may cause unexpected interactions or visual glitches. Ensure that any changes
    to collision enable status are properly synchronized with the game world state.
