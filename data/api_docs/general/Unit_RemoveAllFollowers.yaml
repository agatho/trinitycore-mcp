documentation:
  brief: Removes all followers from the unit.
  description: This method removes all followers from the specified unit, effectively
    breaking any existing follow relationships. It is commonly used in scenarios where
    a unit needs to be freed from follower constraints, such as when a player or creature
    is no longer following another entity. The method ensures that all follower relationships
    are cleared and that the unit's follow status is reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->RemoveAllFollowers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically clears all follower-related data structures within
    the unit, including any associated AI or behavior states. It should be used carefully
    in scenarios where follower relationships are important for game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active combat or while the unit
    is performing actions that depend on follower status, as it may cause unexpected
    behavior or errors.
