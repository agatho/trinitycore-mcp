  class: GenericMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void GenericMovementGenerator::Reset(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the movement generator state for the specified unit.
  description: The Reset method clears any active movement behaviors or states associated
    with the GenericMovementGenerator for a given unit. This typically occurs when
    a unit's movement needs to be interrupted or reinitialized, such as during combat
    transitions, spell casting, or when a new movement command is issued. The method
    ensures that the movement generator returns to its initial idle state, allowing
    it to respond to new movement requests properly.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement generator state will be
      reset. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid game entity
      with movement capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset movement generator for a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      GenericMovementGenerator* movementGen = new GenericMovementGenerator();

      movementGen->Reset(creature);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset movement generator during combat state change
    code: "Unit* unit = ...;\nif (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n{\n    GenericMovementGenerator* gen = static_cast<GenericMovementGenerator*>(\n\
      \        unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n    gen->Reset(unit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the motion master system when
    transitioning between different movement states. It does not directly modify the
    unit's position or orientation, but rather resets internal flags and state variables
    that control how the movement generator behaves in subsequent update cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Unit pointer is valid before calling Reset to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method should only be called on movement
    generators that are currently active for the specified unit.
