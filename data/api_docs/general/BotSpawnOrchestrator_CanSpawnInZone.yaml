  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on configured
    spawn rules and restrictions.
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it is permissible to spawn a
    bot within a given zone. This check typically considers factors such as zone type,
    player activity levels, server configuration settings, and any defined restrictions
    or limitations for bot spawning in that particular area. The method returns true
    if spawning is allowed, and false otherwise. It is commonly used during bot initialization
    or when attempting to create new bot instances in specific zones to ensure compliance
    with game mechanics and server policies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether bot spawning is permitted in
    the specified zone. A return value of true means spawning is allowed; false indicates
    that spawning is not permitted due to zone restrictions or configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botSpawnOrchestrator->CanSpawnInZone(1234)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ bot spawn logic\n    botSpawnOrchestrator->SpawnBot(1234);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle case where spawning is not allowed\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"\
      Cannot spawn bot in zone 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal configuration data and may cache results
    for performance reasons. It should be called before attempting to spawn bots in
    zones to prevent invalid operations.
