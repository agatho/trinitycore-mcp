documentation:
  brief: Returns the item ID of the quest source item.
  description: The GetSrcItemId method retrieves the unique identifier of the item
    that serves as the source for a quest. This is typically used to determine which
    item triggers the quest, often found in quest scripts or when examining quest
    data. The method returns a uint32 value representing the item ID, which can be
    used to identify specific items within the game world. This functionality is essential
    for quest handling and item-based quest mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the item ID of the quest source item as a uint32 value. This represents
    the unique identifier of the item that triggers the quest, typically used in quest
    scripts or when examining quest data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 itemId = quest->GetSrcItemId();
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Script Context

      \ source item\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods for full functionality. It typically returns
    zero if no source item is defined for the quest.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if the quest
    does not have a source item defined, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about quest behavior.
