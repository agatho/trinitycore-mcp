  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeClassPerformance
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeClassPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and aggregates performance data for bot classes within the TrinityCore
    environment.
  description: The AnalyzeClassPerformance method collects and processes performance
    metrics related to different bot classes in the game. It evaluates various aspects
    such as combat efficiency, resource usage, and behavior patterns across all active
    bot classes. This method is typically invoked during performance reviews or when
    generating reports on bot effectiveness. The analysis may involve examining player
    actions, AI decision-making processes, and overall system impact. The results
    of this analysis can be used to optimize bot behavior, improve AI algorithms,
    or identify potential issues with specific class implementations.

  notes: This method likely performs heavy computations and may impact performance
    if called too frequently. It should be executed during maintenance windows or
    when system load is low. The method may cache results to avoid redundant processing.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper throttling could cause performance
    degradation. Ensure that the bot system is in a stable state before invoking this
    analysis to avoid inconsistent results.
