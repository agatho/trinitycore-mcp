  class: Quest
  method: GetTreasurePickerId
  signature: const int & Quest::GetTreasurePickerId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the treasure picker ID associated with the quest.
  description: The GetTreasurePickerId method retrieves the unique identifier that
    determines how loot is distributed among players for a given quest. This ID is
    used in conjunction with the quest's loot table to ensure proper distribution
    of items when multiple players are involved in completing the quest. The method
    is typically used during quest completion processing and helps maintain game balance
    by ensuring correct loot distribution mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the treasure picker ID as an integer value, which represents the
    identifier used for determining how loot is distributed among players when multiple
    players are involved in completing the quest. This ID is typically associated
    with a specific loot table or mechanism that controls how items are distributed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int pickerId = quest->GetTreasurePickerId();\nif (pickerId > 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Process the treasure picker ID\n    // This ID determines how loot is\
      \ distributed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Quest class and returns a const reference to an
    integer. It's important to note that this value may be zero or negative in certain
    cases, indicating no treasure picker was assigned. The implementation typically
    involves checking against internal quest data structures and may involve database
    queries depending on how the quest was loaded.
  warnings: This method should only be called during quest completion processing.
    Calling it outside of proper context can lead to incorrect loot distribution behavior
    or even crashes if the quest object is not properly initialized. Also, this method
    does not guarantee that the returned ID will be valid for all players involved
    in the quest.
