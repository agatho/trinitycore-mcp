  method: GetDefaultMapLight
  signature: uint32 DB2Manager::GetDefaultMapLight(uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default light ID for a specified map.
  description: The GetDefaultMapLight method retrieves the default light configuration
    identifier associated with a given map ID. This value is typically used by the
    game engine to determine which lighting settings should be applied to a specific
    map or zone. The method likely accesses internal DB2 data structures that define
    lighting parameters for different areas of the game world. It's commonly used
    during map initialization and rendering processes to ensure proper ambient lighting
    effects are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the default light ID for the specified
    map. This ID corresponds to an entry in the game's light configuration database,
    which defines properties such as ambient light color, intensity, and other visual
    lighting parameters used by the client.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 lightId = sDB2Manager->GetDefaultMapLight(0); // Get default light
      for Eastern Kingdoms

      printf("Default light ID for map 0: %u\n", lightId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on pre-loaded DB2 files containing map lighting
    data. The returned light ID should be validated against existing light definitions
    in the game's database to ensure proper rendering behavior.
