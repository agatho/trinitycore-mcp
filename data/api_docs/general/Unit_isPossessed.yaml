  class: Unit
  method: isPossessed
  signature: bool Unit::isPossessed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently possessed by another entity.
  description: This method checks if the current Unit object is under the control
    of another player or creature, typically used in the context of player versus
    player (PvP) gameplay or controlled creatures. It returns true when the unit is
    being controlled, such as through mind control effects or possess abilities, and
    false otherwise. The method is commonly used to determine if a unit is currently
    under player control or to prevent certain actions from occurring while the unit
    is possessed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently possessed by another entity, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the unit's behavior is being controlled by an external
    source rather than following its own AI logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->isPossessed()) {\n    // Handle possessed unit\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Control Check
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target && target->isPossessed())\
      \ {\n    // Perform actions on possessed unit\n    // This could be used to\
      \ prevent certain abilities or actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other control-related methods
    such as 'isCharmed' or 'isControlled'. It may not be available in all contexts
    depending on the unit type, and should be used carefully when dealing with player-controlled
    creatures. Performance considerations are minimal since this method simply checks
    internal state flags.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between different types of possession
    (e.g., mind control vs. possess). Care should be taken when using it in combination
    with other control methods to avoid confusion or incorrect behavior. Also, be
    aware that this method may return false for units that are controlled but not
    necessarily possessed.
