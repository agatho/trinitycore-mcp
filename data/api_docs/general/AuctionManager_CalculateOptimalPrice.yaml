  class: AuctionManager
  method: CalculateOptimalPrice
  signature: uint64 AuctionManager::CalculateOptimalPrice(uint32 itemId, AuctionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal auction price for an item based on the specified auction
    strategy.
  description: The CalculateOptimalPrice method determines the most profitable or
    strategically appropriate price for an item being auctioned, using a predefined
    auction strategy. This method is typically used by the AuctionHouse system to
    suggest prices that balance player interest with profit margins. The calculation
    considers various factors such as item value, market demand, and historical auction
    data. It is designed to be called during the auction creation process to provide
    intelligent pricing recommendations.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the optimal price is
      being calculated.
  - name: strategy
    description: An enumeration value that defines the auction pricing strategy to
      be applied (e.g., conservative, aggressive, market-based).
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the calculated optimal price for the
    auction in copper coins. This value is typically used as the starting bid or minimum
    bid for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 itemId = 18730; // Ironwood Staff

      AuctionStrategy strategy = AUCTION_STRATEGY_CONSERVATIVE;

      uint64 optimalPrice = auctionManager->CalculateOptimalPrice(itemId, strategy);

      // Returns a calculated price in copper for the Ironwood Staff'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Strategies
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345; // Example Item\nAuctionStrategy strategies[] =\
      \ { AUCTION_STRATEGY_CONSERVATIVE, AUCTION_STRATEGY_AGGRESSIVE, AUCTION_STRATEGY_MARKET_BASED\
      \ };\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    uint64 price = auctionManager->CalculateOptimalPrice(itemId,\
      \ strategies[i]);\n    printf(\"Strategy %d: %llu copper\\n\", i, price);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal market data tracking systems
    and may cache previous calculations for performance. The actual pricing algorithm
    is not publicly exposed but is expected to consider item rarity, vendor sell price,
    recent auction activity, and server economy trends.
  warnings: The returned price values are in copper coins (1 gold = 10000 copper),
    so ensure proper conversion when displaying prices to players. This method should
    only be called with valid item IDs that exist in the game database.
