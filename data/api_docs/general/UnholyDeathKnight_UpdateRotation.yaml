  class: UnholyDeathKnight
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnight::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the unholy death knight's rotation based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for calculating and executing
    the optimal ability sequence for an unholy death knight AI. This method evaluates
    the current combat state, available resources such as runes and energy, and target
    conditions to determine the most effective rotation. It typically integrates with
    the core TrinityCore AI framework to manage spell casting, cooldowns, and resource
    management for the unholy death knight specialization. The method is called regularly
    during combat to ensure optimal performance and adherence to the rotation strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that the death knight is currently fighting
      against. This parameter determines the rotation decisions based on target health,
      debuffs, and other relevant combat factors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnight::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n    \n    // Logic to determine rotation\
      \ based on target\n    // Implementation details would go here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during combat updates.
    It's important to ensure that the target parameter is valid and alive before processing,
    as invalid targets can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
