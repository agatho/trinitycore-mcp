  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetSystemAnalytics
  signature: SystemPerformanceAnalytics BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetSystemAnalytics()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves system performance analytics data for the bot.
  description: The GetSystemAnalytics method collects and returns comprehensive performance
    metrics related to the system resources consumed by the bot. This includes CPU
    usage, memory consumption, thread activity, and other relevant performance indicators
    that help monitor the bot's operational efficiency. The returned SystemPerformanceAnalytics
    object encapsulates these metrics in a structured format for further analysis
    or reporting. This method is typically used in conjunction with performance monitoring
    tools or automated systems to ensure optimal bot behavior and resource utilization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SystemPerformanceAnalytics object containing detailed system performance
    metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, thread information, and other
    relevant performance indicators that reflect the current state of the system resources
    used by the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SystemPerformanceAnalytics analytics = botPerformanceAnalytics.GetSystemAnalytics();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << analytics.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Memory Usage: " << analytics.memoryUsage << " MB" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called too frequently, as
    it gathers real-time system metrics. Consider caching the results or calling it
    at appropriate intervals to avoid unnecessary overhead. The returned data reflects
    the state at the time of the call and may not represent long-term averages.
