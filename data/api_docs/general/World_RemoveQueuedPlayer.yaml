  class: World
  method: RemoveQueuedPlayer
  signature: bool World::RemoveQueuedPlayer(WorldSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a queued player session from the world's player queue.
  description: The RemoveQueuedPlayer method removes a specified WorldSession from
    the internal queue of players waiting to log in. This function is typically invoked
    when a player's login attempt fails or when a queued player disconnects before
    completing the login process. The method ensures that the session is properly
    removed from any pending login structures and cleans up associated resources.
    It returns true if the player was successfully removed from the queue, or false
    if the player was not found in the queue.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player to be
      removed from the login queue. Must not be null.
  returns: True if the session was successfully removed from the queue, false if the
    session was not found in the queue or if an error occurred during removal.
  examples:
  - title: Removing a queued player session
    code: "WorldSession* session = GetPlayerSession();\nif (sWorld->RemoveQueuedPlayer(session))\
      \ {\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"login\", \"Player removed from queue successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"login\", \"Failed to remove player from queue.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and operates on the global world instance. It
    should be called only when dealing with queued sessions, not active sessions.
    The method does not perform any cleanup of the session object itself; it merely
    removes it from the queue structure.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null session pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or a crash. Always validate that the session is valid and queued
    before calling this method.
