  signature: void DungeonBehavior::ExecuteBossStrategy(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the boss encounter strategy for a given group and dungeon encounter.
  description: The ExecuteBossStrategy method is responsible for triggering and managing
    the AI behavior associated with a specific boss encounter within a dungeon. It
    takes a Group object representing the players involved in the encounter and a
    DungeonEncounter object that defines the specifics of the boss fight. This method
    orchestrates the strategic actions, such as summoning adds, initiating special
    abilities, or handling phase transitions, based on the encounter's defined mechanics.
    The method is typically invoked when a boss encounter begins or when specific
    conditions are met during the encounter progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players participating
      in the dungeon encounter. This group is used to determine which players should
      be affected by the boss strategy and to coordinate group-based actions.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to a DungeonEncounter object that defines the properties
      and mechanics of the current boss encounter. This includes information about
      the boss, its phases, abilities, and any special behaviors that should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Strategy Execution
    code: "void MyDungeonBehavior::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    ExecuteBossStrategy(group, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Strategy with Conditional Logic
    code: "void MyDungeonBehavior::HandlePhaseChange(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter, uint32 phase)\n{\n    if (phase == 1)\n        ExecuteBossStrategy(group,\
      \ encounter);\n    else if (phase == 2)\n        ExecuteBossStrategy(group,\
      \ encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon encounter AI system and relies on the
    DungeonEncounter data structure to determine how to execute boss behaviors. It
    assumes that the group has been properly initialized and contains valid players.
    The actual implementation details of the strategy execution are likely handled
    by internal AI modules or event handlers.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the DungeonEncounter
    object must be valid and properly initialized for the strategy to execute correctly.
