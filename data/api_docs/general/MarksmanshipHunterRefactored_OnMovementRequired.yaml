  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: OnMovementRequired
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::OnMovementRequired()
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement-related logic when the marksmanship hunter is required to
    move during combat.
  description: The OnMovementRequired method is invoked when the MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
    AI component needs to execute specific movement behaviors. This typically occurs
    during combat scenarios where the hunter must reposition itself for optimal shot
    placement or to avoid incoming threats. The method may adjust positioning, initiate
    movement animations, or trigger pathfinding logic to ensure the hunter maintains
    an effective tactical stance. It is part of the core AI decision-making loop and
    integrates with the broader combat system to optimize hunter performance in various
    encounter situations.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_shouldMove)\n\
      \        OnMovementRequired();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when movement is actually required by the
    AI logic. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, ensuring that combat
    flow isn't interrupted. The implementation may involve checking for obstacles,
    calculating optimal paths, or adjusting positioning relative to targets.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in rapid succession without proper state checks,
    as it might cause unnecessary movement calculations or conflict with other AI
    behaviors. Ensure the hunter has valid target and positioning data before invoking
    this method.
