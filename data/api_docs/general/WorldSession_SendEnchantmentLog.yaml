  class: WorldSession
  method: SendEnchantmentLog
  signature: void WorldSession::SendEnchantmentLog(int owner, int caster, int itemGuid,
    uint32 itemId, uint32 enchantId, uint32 enchantSlot)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an enchantment log packet to the client containing information about
    item enchantments applied by a caster.
  description: The SendEnchantmentLog method constructs and sends a packet to the
    connected client that logs enchantment events. This method is typically used when
    an item is enchanted, providing details such as the owner of the item, the caster
    who performed the enchantment, the item's GUID and ID, and the enchantment ID
    and slot. The packet is formatted according to the World of Warcraft client's
    expected structure for enchantment logging, ensuring that the client displays
    appropriate visual feedback or logs the event in the UI. This method does not
    return any value and directly communicates with the client through the session's
    network layer.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: The GUID of the player who owns the item being enchanted.
  - name: caster
    description: The GUID of the player or creature that performed the enchantment.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the enchanted item.
  - name: itemId
    description: The database ID of the item being enchanted.
  - name: enchantId
    description: The ID of the enchantment that was applied to the item.
  - name: enchantSlot
    description: The slot index where the enchantment was applied (e.g., main hand,
      off-hand, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendEnchantmentLog
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint64 ownerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      uint64 casterGuid = player->GetGUID();

      uint64 itemGuid = item->GetGUID();

      uint32 itemId = item->GetEntry();

      uint32 enchantId = 1234;

      uint32 enchantSlot = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND;

      session->SendEnchantmentLog(ownerGuid, casterGuid, itemGuid, itemId, enchantId,
      enchantSlot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game server when an enchantment
    is successfully applied to an item. It relies on the session's underlying network
    communication system to deliver the packet to the client. The method assumes that
    all parameters are valid and properly initialized before being passed.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUIDs and IDs passed to this method correspond to existing
    entities in the game world, as invalid values may cause client-side errors or
    unexpected behavior. Also, be cautious when calling this method outside of appropriate
    enchantment contexts to avoid sending malformed packets.
