  brief: Removes the player from their social list, effectively ending their social
    interactions.
  description: The RemoveSocial method removes a player from their social list, which
    typically includes friends, guild members, and other players they are connected
    to. This action is often used when a player logs out or disconnects from the game,
    ensuring that their social presence is cleared from the game world. The method
    does not require any parameters and performs no direct return operations. It is
    part of the broader social system management within TrinityCore's Player class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveSocial();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically invoked during logout or disconnection processes
    to ensure clean removal from social lists. It may also be used in conjunction
    with other methods like RemoveFromSocialList to fully manage player social presence.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly unless the player is logging
    out or disconnecting, as it can disrupt social interactions and potentially cause
    issues with player-to-player communication.
