  method: GetFaction
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the faction identifier associated with the GameObject.
  description: The GetFaction method retrieves the faction ID that is assigned to
    a GameObject instance. This faction ID determines how the GameObject interacts
    with player characters in terms of hostilities, quest interactions, and other
    game mechanics. The method is commonly used in scripts or AI logic to determine
    the behavior of GameObjects based on their faction relationships. It should be
    noted that this method does not return the faction template ID directly but rather
    the specific faction ID assigned to the GameObject.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the faction ID of the GameObject. This
    value typically corresponds to an entry in the faction table within the database,
    and can be used for determining interactions with players or other GameObjects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 factionId = gameObject->GetFaction();\nif (factionId == 119) {\n\
      \    // Do something specific to this faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 factionId = gameObject->GetFaction();\nif (factionId != 0) {\n \
      \   // This GameObject has a valid faction assigned\n    // Use this faction\
      \ ID to determine player interaction behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight operation as it simply returns a stored value without additional
    computation. The faction ID returned by this method is typically set during GameObject
    creation or initialization.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other faction-related
    methods, as incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior in quest or NPC interactions.
    Also, ensure that the faction ID returned is valid and exists in the database.
