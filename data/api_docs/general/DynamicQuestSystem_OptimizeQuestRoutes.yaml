  method: OptimizeQuestRoutes
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestRoutes()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes quest routes for players by analyzing available quests and determining
    the most efficient path to complete them.
  description: The OptimizeQuestRoutes method calculates and applies an optimized
    sequence of quest objectives for a player, aiming to minimize travel time and
    resource expenditure. This method analyzes the current state of the player's quest
    log, evaluates the geographical positions of quest givers and objectives, and
    determines the most efficient route through the world. It is typically invoked
    when a player's quest log changes or when they explicitly request route optimization.
    The optimization considers factors such as proximity of quest locations, quest
    dependencies, and available transportation methods. This method modifies the internal
    quest routing data structures but does not directly interact with the game client's
    UI.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem& questSystem = sObjectAccessor->GetDynamicQuestSystem();

      questSystem.OptimizeQuestRoutes();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is computationally intensive and may cause temporary performance
    degradation during execution. It should not be called excessively in rapid succession.
    The optimization algorithm considers both direct paths and potential shortcuts
    through known transportation methods like flight paths or teleportation.
  warnings: Calling this method while a player is actively engaged in quest progression
    may lead to unexpected behavior if the optimized route conflicts with current
    quest state. Ensure that quest completion events are properly handled after route
    optimization.
