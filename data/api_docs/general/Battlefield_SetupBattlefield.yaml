  class: Battlefield
  method: SetupBattlefield
  signature: bool Battlefield::SetupBattlefield()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures the battlefield environment for a Battlefront
    instance.
  description: The SetupBattlefield method prepares the necessary components and data
    structures required for a Battlefield to function properly. This includes initializing
    objectives, setting up player tracking systems, configuring spawn points, and
    preparing the battlefield's state management. The method ensures that all required
    resources are allocated and that the battlefield is ready to handle player interactions
    and combat events. It typically gets called during the initialization phase of
    a Battlefield instance, before players can enter or engage in battle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battlefield was successfully initialized and configured;
    returns false if any critical setup step failed, preventing the battlefield from
    operating correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Battlefield Setup
    code: "Battlefield* bf = new Battlefield();\nif (bf->SetupBattlefield()) {\n \
      \   // Battlefield is ready for players\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_READY);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle setup failure\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_SETUP_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Battlefield system during
    instance creation. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom battlefield logic or extending existing functionality. The method may perform
    database operations and resource allocation that could impact performance if called
    frequently.
  warnings: Calling SetupBattlefield on an already initialized battlefield may result
    in undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that this method is only invoked
    once per battlefield instance, typically during construction or initialization
    phases.
