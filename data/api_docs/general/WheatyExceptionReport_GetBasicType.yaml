  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: GetBasicType
  signature: BasicType WheatyExceptionReport::GetBasicType(DWORD typeIndex, DWORD64
    modBase) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the basic type information for a given exception type index and
    module base address.
  description: The GetBasicType method is used to determine the fundamental type of
    an exception based on its index and the base address of the module where it originated.
    This method is typically employed in debugging and crash reporting systems within
    TrinityCore to categorize exceptions and provide meaningful diagnostic information.
    It allows developers to understand the nature of exceptions occurring in the game
    server, which is crucial for maintaining stability and performance. The method
    requires a valid type index and module base address to return accurate type information.
  parameters:
  - name: typeIndex
    description: The index identifying the specific exception type within the system's
      exception handling mechanism. This value typically corresponds to an entry in
      an internal exception type table.
  - name: modBase
    description: The base address of the module where the exception occurred. This
      is used to resolve symbol information and determine context-specific type details
      for the exception.
  returns: Returns a BasicType enumeration value that represents the fundamental classification
    of the exception. Possible values may include types such as 'Unknown', 'AccessViolation',
    'StackOverflow', or other system-defined exception categories.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handling
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport report;\nDWORD typeIndex = 5;\nDWORD64 modBase =\
      \ 0x12345678;\nBasicType basicType = report.GetBasicType(typeIndex, modBase);\n\
      if (basicType == BasicType::AccessViolation)\n{\n    // Handle access violation\
      \ specifically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a crash reporting utility and should only be called
    from within exception handling contexts. The typeIndex and modBase parameters
    must be valid; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. This method may involve memory
    access operations to retrieve type information, so it should not be called in
    performance-critical sections.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized parameters can lead
    to crashes or incorrect results. Ensure that typeIndex corresponds to a known
    exception type and modBase points to a valid loaded module address before invoking
    this method.
