  class: DPSPositioning
  method: CalculateDPSEfficiency
  signature: float DPSPositioning::CalculateDPSEfficiency(const int & pos, Player
    * dps, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage per second efficiency of a player based on their positioning
    relative to a target.
  description: The CalculateDPSEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a player's
    position contributes to their damage output against a specified target. This function
    likely considers factors such as line of sight, distance, and potential threat
    generation from the player's location. It is used in scenarios where optimal positioning
    is crucial for maximizing DPS, such as in raid encounters or PvP situations. The
    method returns a float value representing the calculated efficiency, which can
    be used to guide positioning decisions or evaluate performance.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the positional index or identifier of the
      player's location relative to the target.
  - name: dps
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose damage efficiency is being calculated.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that serves as the target for which
      the DPS efficiency is evaluated.
  returns: A float value indicating the calculated damage per second efficiency. Higher
    values typically represent more optimal positioning for maximizing damage output.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float efficiency = dpsPositioning->CalculateDPSEfficiency(1, player, target);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Position Optimization Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < maxPositions; ++i) {\n    float currentEfficiency =\
      \ dpsPositioning->CalculateDPSEfficiency(i, player, target);\n    if (currentEfficiency\
      \ > bestEfficiency) {\n        bestEfficiency = currentEfficiency;\n       \
      \ bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex calculations including threat modeling, damage
    modifiers based on distance, and line-of-sight checks. Developers should consider
    caching results if this function is called frequently during performance-critical
    operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player and Unit pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. The 'pos' parameter must be
    within acceptable bounds for the specific implementation.
