documentation:
  brief: Removes expired loot roll entries from the distribution system
  description: The CleanupExpiredRolls method iterates through all active loot rolls
    in the distribution system and removes any that have exceeded their designated
    time limit. This ensures that stale loot rolls do not persist in memory or cause
    conflicts during future loot distribution events. The method is typically invoked
    periodically by the game server's maintenance routines to keep the loot system
    clean and efficient. It operates on the principle of time-based expiration, where
    each loot roll has a defined duration after which it becomes invalid.

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Maintenance
    code: "void GameServer::Update()\n{\n    // Periodic cleanup of expired loot rolls\n\
      \    sLootDistribution->CleanupExpiredRolls();\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game thread and should
    not be invoked concurrently with other loot distribution operations. The cleanup
    process is optimized to minimize performance impact by batching expired roll removals
    rather than processing each one individually.
