  method: InitializeDemonHunterBaseline
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializeDemonHunterBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation manager for Demon Hunters with default
    combat settings and ability priorities.
  description: The InitializeDemonHunterBaseline method sets up the core configuration
    for Demon Hunter class-specific rotations within the TrinityCore AI system. This
    includes establishing default ability priority lists, setting up cooldown tracking
    mechanisms, configuring resource management strategies such as Fury generation
    and spender timing, and initializing combat state variables required for optimal
    rotation execution. The method prepares the rotation manager to handle Demon Hunter-specific
    mechanics like Soul Fragments, Fel Rush, and Havoc generation. It ensures that
    all necessary data structures are properly initialized before any combat rotation
    logic begins, making it essential for proper AI behavior in Demon Hunter encounters.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeDemonHunterBaseline();

      // Rotation manager is now ready to handle Demon Hunter combat rotations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the AI initialization phase before
    any combat actions are taken. It performs no validation of existing state and
    will overwrite any previous configuration. The initialization process includes
    setting up internal timers, priority queues, and resource tracking systems specific
    to Demon Hunter gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent rotation behavior. Ensure that the player character
    is in a valid combat-ready state before calling this method.
