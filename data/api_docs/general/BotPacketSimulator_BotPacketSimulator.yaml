  brief: Copies the state of another BotPacketSimulator instance
  description: The BotPacketSimulator constructor that accepts a const reference to
    another BotPacketSimulator object performs a deep copy of all internal state and
    data members. This constructor is typically used to create a duplicate of an existing
    packet simulator, preserving its configuration and current simulation state for
    use in separate contexts or scenarios. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this allows developers to replicate packet simulation behavior across different
    bot instances or simulation environments without reconfiguring each one individually.

  - title: Creating a copy of a BotPacketSimulator
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator originalSimulator;

      // Configure originalSimulator...

      BotPacketSimulator copiedSimulator(originalSimulator); // Uses the copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs deep copying of internal data structures
    to ensure that modifications to one instance do not affect another. It's important
    to note that this is a copy constructor, not a regular method, and should be used
    in contexts where object duplication is required.
