documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell script is currently executing within a target
    hook context.
  description: The IsInTargetHook method checks if the current spell script execution
    context is inside a target hook, which occurs when the spell is evaluating its
    targets or applying effects to specific targets. This method is commonly used
    in spell scripts to modify behavior based on whether the spell is processing targets,
    such as adjusting damage calculations or applying effects conditionally. The method
    returns true when the script is actively within a target evaluation phase and
    false otherwise. This functionality is particularly useful for custom spell implementations
    that need to differentiate between global spell execution and per-target processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell script is currently executing within a target
    hook context, indicating that the spell is evaluating or applying effects to specific
    targets. Returns false if the script is not in a target hook context, meaning
    it's operating in a global or non-target-specific phase of spell execution.
  examples:
  - title: Conditional Damage Based on Target Hook
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleDamage(SpellEffIndex\
      \ effIndex) override\n    {\n        if (IsInTargetHook())\n        {\n    \
      \        // Apply increased damage when processing targets\n            int32\
      \ damage = GetHitDamage();\n            SetHitDamage(damage * 2);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within a SpellScript implementation
    where target hook evaluation is relevant. The method does not perform any expensive
    operations and provides immediate context information about the current execution
    phase of the spell script.
