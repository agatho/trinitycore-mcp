api:
  class: CooldownManager
  method: ReduceCooldown
  signature: void CooldownManager::ReduceCooldown(uint32 spellId, uint32 reductionMs)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the cooldown time for a specified spell by the given milliseconds.
  description: The ReduceCooldown method decreases the remaining cooldown time of
    a spell by the specified number of milliseconds. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft to implement effects that shorten spell cooldowns, such
    as haste buffs, cooldown reduction items, or special abilities. The method operates
    on the cooldown manager associated with a player or unit, modifying the internal
    cooldown tracking for the given spell ID. It's important to note that this reduction
    does not extend beyond the minimum possible cooldown time and may be subject to
    game mechanics like minimum cooldown limits or cooldown caps.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose cooldown will be reduced.
      This must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: reductionMs
    description: The amount of time (in milliseconds) by which to reduce the spell's
      cooldown. Must be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cooldown Reduction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      CooldownManager* cm = player->GetSpellCooldownMgr();

      cm->ReduceCooldown(12345, 5000); // Reduce cooldown of spell ID 12345 by 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Haste Effect
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...;

      uint32 hasteReduction = 2000; // 2 second reduction

      CooldownManager* cm = unit->GetSpellCooldownMgr();

      cm->ReduceCooldown(98765, hasteReduction); // Apply haste effect to spell ID
      98765'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal cooldown tracking and should only be called
    on valid spell IDs that are tracked by the cooldown manager. The reduction is
    applied directly to the remaining cooldown time, but will not reduce it below
    zero or any game-defined minimum. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with effects that modify cooldowns, such as haste buffs, cooldown reduction gear,
    or special abilities.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may result in undefined behavior
    or no effect. Ensure the spell ID exists and is tracked by the cooldown manager
    before calling. Also, be cautious when reducing cooldowns to zero or negative
    values, as this could lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics that rely
    on cooldown tracking.
