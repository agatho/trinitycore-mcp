  class: Battleground
  method: GetBracketId
  signature: int Battleground::GetBracketId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bracket ID associated with the battleground instance.
  description: The GetBracketId method retrieves the bracket identifier for the current
    battleground instance. In World of Warcraft's battleground system, brackets are
    used to group players of similar levels or ratings together for balanced matchmaking.
    This method is commonly used during battleground initialization and player assignment
    to ensure proper team balancing and rating calculations. The returned value typically
    corresponds to predefined bracket constants such as 0 for 15v15, 1 for 10v10,
    and 2 for 5v5 brackets. This identifier plays a crucial role in determining the
    type of battleground and its specific ruleset.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bracket ID of the battleground. Common values
    include 0 for 15v15, 1 for 10v10, and 2 for 5v5 brackets. The exact mapping may
    vary depending on the specific battleground type and game version.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int bracketId = bg->GetBracketId();

      printf("Battleground bracket ID: %d\n", bracketId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bracket ID for Logic
    code: "Battleground* bg = GetBattleground();\nint bracketId = bg->GetBracketId();\n\
      if (bracketId == 2) {\n    // Handle 5v5 specific logic\n    printf(\"This is\
      \ a 5v5 battleground\\n\");\n} else if (bracketId == 1) {\n    // Handle 10v10\
      \ specific logic\n    printf(\"This is a 10v10 battleground\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The bracket ID returned by this method directly correlates with the battleground's
    type and affects how players are matched, scored, and rewarded. This value should
    not be modified directly as it is determined during battleground creation and
    initialization.
