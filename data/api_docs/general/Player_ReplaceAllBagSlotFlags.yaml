  method: ReplaceAllBagSlotFlags
  signature: void Player::ReplaceAllBagSlotFlags(uint32 bagIndex, int flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all bag slot flags for a specified bag index in the player's inventory.
  description: This method updates the flags associated with all slots within a specific
    bag index, allowing for manipulation of bag slot properties such as slot availability
    or restrictions. It is commonly used during inventory management operations where
    bag slot configurations need to be modified, particularly when handling item interactions
    or when updating bag contents. The method operates on the player's bag data structure
    and modifies flags based on provided parameters, ensuring proper slot behavior
    within the game context.
  parameters:
  - name: bagIndex
    description: The index of the bag whose slot flags are to be replaced. This represents
      a valid bag slot in the player's inventory, typically ranging from 0 to 11 for
      normal bags.
  - name: flags
    description: The new flag value to replace all existing slot flags with. This
      can represent various properties such as slot restrictions or availability,
      and is usually a bitmask representing specific bag slot characteristics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ReplaceAllBagSlotFlags(0, 1);

      // Sets all slots in bag index 0 to have flag value 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ReplaceAllBagSlotFlags(3, 0x0000000F);

      // Replaces all slot flags in bag index 3 with a bitmask representing 4 slots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during inventory management operations and
    requires careful handling of bag indices to avoid unintended consequences. It
    may affect item slot availability or restrictions depending on the flag value
    provided.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect bag slot configurations,
    potentially causing items to become inaccessible or misconfigured in player's
    inventory.
