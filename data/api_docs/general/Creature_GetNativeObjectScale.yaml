  class: Creature
  method: GetNativeObjectScale
  signature: float Creature::GetNativeObjectScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the native scale factor of the creature object.
  description: This method retrieves the native scale value that is assigned to a
    creature instance, which determines how the creature appears in terms of size
    within the game world. The scale factor affects visual representation and can
    influence collision detection and interaction with other objects. This value is
    typically set during the creature's creation or initialization phase and remains
    constant throughout its lifecycle unless explicitly modified.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the native scale of the creature, where
    1.0f corresponds to normal size, values less than 1.0f indicate smaller size,
    and values greater than 1.0f indicate larger size.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float scale = creature->GetNativeObjectScale();\nif (scale > 1.0f)\n{\n\
      \    // Creature is larger than normal\n}\nelse if (scale < 1.0f)\n{\n    //\
      \ Creature is smaller than normal\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Creature is normal size\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the base Creature class and provides access to a fundamental
    property used in rendering and collision detection. It should be used carefully
    as modifying this value may affect game balance and visual consistency.
  warnings: Modifying the scale directly can cause inconsistencies with game mechanics
    and may lead to unexpected behavior during interactions with other objects or
    players.
