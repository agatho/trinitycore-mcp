    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a multiple questgiver status query packet from the client
  description: Handles the QuestGiverStatusMultipleQuery packet sent by the client
    to request the status of multiple quest givers. This method is used when a player
    interacts with several quest givers in quick succession or when the client needs
    to know the available quest status for multiple NPCs at once. The method processes
    the packet and sends back appropriate quest status information for each queried
    quest giver. It typically handles the logic for determining which quests are available,
    in progress, or completed for each NPC based on the player's current quest log
    and progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestgiverStatusMultipleQuery(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestGiverStatusMultipleQuery&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process each quest giver in the packet\n    for (auto const&\
      \ questGiver : packet.QuestGivers)\n    {\n        // Retrieve and send quest\
      \ status for each quest giver\n        SendQuestGiverStatus(questGiver.Guid,\
      \ GetPlayer()->GetQuestStatus(questGiver.Guid));\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system's client-server communication and
    should only be called when a valid packet is received. The method assumes that
    the player object exists and has been properly initialized. It may involve database
    lookups for quest status information.
  warnings: Improper handling of this packet could cause quest status to display incorrectly
    for players. Ensure all quest giver GUIDs in the packet are valid before processing.
    This method should not be called directly without proper packet validation.
