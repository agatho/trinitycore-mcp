  method: GetOptimalTracking
  signature: uint32 BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::GetOptimalTracking() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal tracking level for a Beast Mastery hunter
    based on current talent points and pet state.
  description: The GetOptimalTracking method determines the highest tracking ability
    level that a Beast Mastery hunter can currently use, considering their active
    talents, pet's current status, and any applicable buffs or debuffs. This value
    represents the maximum tracking tier (e.g., 1-5) that the hunter's pet can effectively
    utilize. The method evaluates the hunter's talent tree specifically for tracking-related
    abilities, such as Improved Tracking and Master's Call, and ensures the returned
    value aligns with the current game state including pet health, mana, and available
    tracking abilities. It is primarily used by the AI system to make decisions about
    when to use tracking abilities during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the optimal tracking level (1-5) that the
    hunter's pet can currently utilize. A value of 0 indicates no valid tracking ability
    is available or the hunter has no active pet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 optimalTracking = hunter.GetOptimalTracking();\nif (optimalTracking\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use tracking ability with the determined level\n    pet->UseTracking(optimalTracking);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pet State Management
    code: "uint32 trackingLevel = hunter.GetOptimalTracking();\nif (trackingLevel\
      \ > 0 && hunter.GetPet()->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Only proceed if pet is alive\
      \ and tracking is available\n    hunter.GetPet()->SetTrackingLevel(trackingLevel);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during combat AI updates, so performance
    is optimized to avoid expensive calculations. The returned value should not be
    cached across multiple game ticks as it can change due to talent upgrades or pet
    state changes.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees the pet will successfully
    use the tracking ability; additional checks for pet health, mana, and cooldowns
    are required before executing the actual tracking action.
