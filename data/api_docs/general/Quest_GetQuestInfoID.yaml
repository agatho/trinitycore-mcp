documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the quest.
  description: The GetQuestInfoID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) associated
    with a specific quest object. This identifier is used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework to distinguish between different quests and track their state. The method
    is typically called during quest-related operations such as quest completion,
    acceptance, or when checking quest status. It provides a way to access the quest's
    internal identification without exposing the underlying data structure directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the quest.
    This GUID is used internally by TrinityCore to track quest state and can be used
    for various quest-related operations including checking if a quest has been completed
    or accepted.
