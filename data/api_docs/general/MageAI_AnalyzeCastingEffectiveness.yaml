documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the effectiveness of currently casting spells and adjusts AI behavior
    accordingly
  description: The AnalyzeCastingEffectiveness method performs a comprehensive evaluation
    of the mage's current spellcasting state, examining factors such as spell cooldowns,
    mana efficiency, target conditions, and combat effectiveness. This method is typically
    invoked during AI update cycles to dynamically adjust spell selection and casting
    priorities based on real-time battlefield conditions. It helps ensure that the
    mage AI selects the most optimal spells for the current situation, considering
    both immediate tactical needs and long-term resource management.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    AnalyzeCastingEffectiveness();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MageAI's core decision-making framework and should
    be called regularly during AI update cycles. It modifies internal AI state variables
    that influence subsequent spell casting decisions. The method does not directly
    cast spells but rather evaluates and prepares the AI for optimal casting choices.
  warnings: This method assumes that the AI has access to valid target information
    and current spell data. Calling it without proper setup may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect AI decisions. It should not be called during spell casting
    operations as it may interfere with active spell states.
