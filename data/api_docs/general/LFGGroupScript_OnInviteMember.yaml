  class: LFGGroupScript
  method: OnInviteMember
  signature: void LFGGroupScript::OnInviteMember(Group * group, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a player is invited to join a Looking for Group (LFG) instance.
  description: The OnInviteMember method is a callback function within the LFGGroupScript
    class that gets triggered whenever a player is invited to join an LFG group or
    dungeon. This method allows custom scripts to respond to invitation events, such
    as logging the event, modifying player behavior, or enforcing custom rules during
    the LFG process. It is part of TrinityCore's LFG system which manages group formation
    and dungeon matching for players seeking cooperative content. The method provides
    access to both the target group and the GUID of the invited player, enabling developers
    to implement logic based on group composition or individual player data.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that the player is being invited to join.
      This represents the LFG group or instance the player is being added to.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being invited. This is
      used to identify the specific player within the game world and can be used to
      retrieve player data or perform operations on that particular character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyLFGScript : public LFGGroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyLFGScript()\
      \ : LFGGroupScript(\"MyLFGScript\") {}\n\n    void OnInviteMember(Group* group,\
      \ uint64 guid) override\n    {\n        // Log the invitation event\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %u was invited to group.\", guid);\n \
      \       \n        // Optionally check if player is already in another group\n\
      \        Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(guid);\n        if (player\
      \ && player->GetGroup() != group)\n        {\n            // Handle cross-group\
      \ invitations\n            sLog->outString(\"Player %s was invited to a different\
      \ group.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the LFG invitation process, typically when a
    player is selected by the LFG system to join a specific group. Developers should
    be aware that this method may be invoked multiple times for the same player if
    they are invited to different groups or re-invited after leaving. The Group pointer
    provided is valid only within the scope of this function call and should not be
    stored for later use without proper reference management.
  warnings: Do not perform operations that might block or delay execution, as this
    method is called synchronously during LFG processing. Avoid modifying group membership
    directly from this callback unless absolutely necessary, as it could lead to inconsistent
    group states or crashes. Be cautious when accessing player data through the GUID,
    as the player may not be online or accessible at all times.
