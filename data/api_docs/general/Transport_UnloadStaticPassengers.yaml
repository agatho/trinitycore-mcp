documentation:
  brief: Removes all static passengers from the transport object
  description: The UnloadStaticPassengers method removes all static passengers currently
    aboard a transport vehicle. This function is typically called during transport
    shutdown, cleanup, or when transitioning between different transport states. It
    ensures that all passenger entities are properly dismounted and their references
    are cleared from the transport's internal passenger lists. The method handles
    the cleanup of static passenger data without affecting dynamic passengers or the
    transport's operational state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in transport cleanup
    code: "void MyTransport::OnTransportDestroy()\n{\n    UnloadStaticPassengers();\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore transport
    system during shutdown sequences. It's important to note that this function only
    handles static passengers and does not affect dynamic passengers or other transport-related
    entities. The method assumes all necessary synchronization has been handled by
    the calling code.
