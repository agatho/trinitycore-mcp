  class: MageAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void MageAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(uint32 spellId, ::Unit * target,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an attempt to interrupt a spell cast by a target unit.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about a successful
    or failed attempt to interrupt another unit's spell casting. This method is typically
    used within the MageAI class to track interruption effectiveness and behavior
    for AI decision-making purposes. The recorded data includes the spell ID that
    was interrupted, the target unit attempting the interruption, and whether the
    interruption succeeded. This functionality supports game mechanics related to
    spell interruption, such as determining when a mage should attempt to interrupt
    an opponent's casting.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell being interrupted. This corresponds to
      the Spell ID used in the TrinityCore database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is the target of the interruption
      attempt. Can be nullptr if no valid target exists.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interruption was successful (true)
      or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Attempt Recording
    code: "void SomeMageAI::HandleInterrupt()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        RecordInterruptAttempt(118, target, true);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Interrupt Attempt
    code: "void MageAI::TryInterruptSpell()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (target && !target->IsNonCombatPet())\n    {\n        // Simulate a\
      \ failed interruption attempt\n        RecordInterruptAttempt(12345, target,\
      \ false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MageAI class and likely used for internal AI tracking
    and logging. It does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but contributes to
    AI behavior analysis and debugging. The method assumes valid spell IDs and target
    units, though it can handle nullptr targets gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell in the
    TrinityCore database; otherwise, the recorded data may be meaningless. Be cautious
    when calling this method with null target pointers as it could lead to invalid
    logging entries.
