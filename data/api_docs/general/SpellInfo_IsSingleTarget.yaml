  method: IsSingleTarget
  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsSingleTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is a single-target spell.
  description: This method checks if the spell is classified as a single-target spell,
    meaning it targets only one unit rather than multiple units. It is commonly used
    in spell processing to determine how spells should be handled during combat, particularly
    when dealing with target selection and damage calculation. The method returns
    true for spells that affect only one target, such as direct damage spells or healing
    spells that do not affect multiple targets simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is a single-target spell, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the spell affects only one target or multiple targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsSingleTarget()) {\n    // Handle single target logic\n\
      \    // Do something specific to single target spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell properties
    to determine how a spell should be processed during combat. It may be used in
    conjunction with spell target selection logic to ensure proper handling of single-target
    spells versus multi-target spells.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the spell will always target only
    one unit; it simply indicates whether the spell is classified as single-target
    based on its properties.
