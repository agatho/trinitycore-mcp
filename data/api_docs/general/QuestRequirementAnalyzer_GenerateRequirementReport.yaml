api:
  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: GenerateRequirementReport
  signature: std::string QuestRequirementAnalyzer::GenerateRequirementReport(uint32
    questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed requirement report for a specified quest, including
    missing prerequisites and eligibility checks.
  description: The GenerateRequirementReport method analyzes the given quest ID against
    the player's current state to produce a comprehensive report detailing which requirements
    are met and which are not. This includes checking level restrictions, quest completion
    status, item possession, and other prerequisite conditions necessary for the quest
    to be available or completable. The method is typically used by quest bots or
    automated systems to determine why a quest might be unavailable to a player. It
    returns a formatted string that can be displayed directly to the user or logged
    for debugging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to analyze. Must correspond to
      a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      eligibility is being checked. This player's state determines which requirements
      are met or missing.
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted report listing all requirements for
    the specified quest, indicating whether each one is satisfied or not. The format
    includes details such as level checks, item requirements, previous quest completion
    status, and any other relevant conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 questId = 12345;

      Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      std::string report = analyzer.GenerateRequirementReport(questId, player);

      printf("Quest Report:\n%s\n", report.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Quest Bot Context
    code: "void CheckQuestEligibility(Player* bot, uint32 questId) {\n    QuestRequirementAnalyzer\
      \ analyzer;\n    std::string report = analyzer.GenerateRequirementReport(questId,\
      \ bot);\n    if (!report.empty()) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Quest %u Requirement\
      \ Report:\\n%s\", questId, report.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple database lookups and checks against the player's
    current state. It may have performance implications if called frequently in rapid
    succession. The returned string is formatted for readability and includes line
    breaks for easy display in logs or UI elements.
  warnings: Ensure that both questId and bot are valid before calling this method;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method does not validate whether
    the player is in a valid state (e.g., connected, logged in) to perform checks.
