  method: CastMountSpell
  signature: bool MountManager::CastMountSpell(int * player, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a mount spell on the specified player, returning true if successful.
  description: The CastMountSpell method attempts to cast a mount spell on a given
    player character. It takes a pointer to a player object and a spell identifier,
    then triggers the spell casting process. This method is typically used in the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation where players
    can mount creatures or vehicles using specific spells. The method returns true
    if the spell was successfully cast, and false otherwise. Precondition includes
    a valid player pointer and a valid spell ID that corresponds to a mount spell.
    Postcondition is that either the mount spell is cast successfully or an error
    occurs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object on which the mount spell will be cast.
      Must not be null and must point to a valid Player instance.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the mount spell to be cast. This should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the database that represents a mount ability.
  returns: True if the mount spell was successfully cast on the player, false otherwise.
    Returns false if the player pointer is invalid, the spell ID does not exist, or
    the spell casting fails for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Spell Casting
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 mountSpellId\
      \ = 34090; // Example mount spell ID\nbool success = sMountManager->CastMountSpell(&player,\
      \ mountSpellId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Mount spell cast successfully\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Failed to cast mount spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and that the spell ID
    corresponds to an actual mount spell in the database. It may not perform any validation
    beyond checking for null pointers or invalid spell IDs. The actual mounting behavior
    depends on the spell's implementation in the TrinityCore server.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the spell ID corresponds to a legitimate mount spell; otherwise, the spell
    may not function correctly or at all.
