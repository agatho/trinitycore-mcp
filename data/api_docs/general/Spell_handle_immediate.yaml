documentation:
  brief: Handles immediate spell execution by processing all pending spell effects
    and actions.
  description: The handle_immediate method processes all pending spell effects and
    actions within the Spell class, executing any immediate effects that were previously
    deferred or queued. This method is crucial for managing spell execution timing
    and ensuring proper handling of spells that require immediate action rather than
    delayed execution. It typically involves processing the spell's target selection,
    effect application, and any immediate consequences that should occur upon spell
    activation.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Execution
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellId);

      spell->handle_immediate();

      // Executes the spell immediately without delay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the spell is ready for immediate execution.
    The implementation typically involves checking if the spell has been properly
    initialized and that all prerequisites have been met before proceeding with immediate
    execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all spell parameters are valid before calling
    handle_immediate.
