api:
  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: SynchronizeGroupStates
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::SynchronizeGroupStates(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the instance states of all members within a specified group.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupStates method ensures that all players in the provided
    group have their instance-related data updated to match the current state of the
    instance. This is crucial for maintaining consistency when players enter or exit
    instances, particularly in scenarios involving multiple players, such as raids
    or dungeons. The method typically handles synchronization of instance IDs, reset
    times, and other relevant instance metadata across all group members. It's commonly
    invoked during group entry into instances or when instance state changes occur
    that require all members to be updated accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose members' instance states will be
      synchronized. Must not be null and must contain valid group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Synchronizing Group States After Instance Entry
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    sInstanceCoordination->SynchronizeGroupStates(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the instance management system
    when group membership changes or when instance state transitions occur. It's important
    to ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and represents an active group
    with members who are currently in instances.
  warnings: Passing a null Group pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always verify that the group exists and contains players before calling
    this method.
