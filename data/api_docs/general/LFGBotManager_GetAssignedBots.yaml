  method: GetAssignedBots
  signature: int LFGBotManager::GetAssignedBots(int humanGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of bots assigned to a specific human player in the LFG
    system
  description: The GetAssignedBots method returns the count of bot companions that
    have been assigned to a given human player within the Looking For Group (LFG)
    framework. This functionality is typically used in TrinityCore's LFG bot system
    to track how many automated players are supporting a particular human user during
    group activities such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds. The method takes a
    human player's GUID as input and provides a numeric count of assigned bots. It's
    important to note that this method operates within the context of the LFGBotManager
    class which manages bot assignments and interactions in LFG scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: humanGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the human player for whom to retrieve
      assigned bot count. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database system.
  returns: An integer representing the number of bots currently assigned to the specified
    human player. Returns 0 if no bots are assigned or if the player GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int botCount = lfgBotManager->GetAssignedBots(playerGuid);\nif (botCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    printf(\"Player has %d bots assigned\\n\", botCount);\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"No bots assigned to player\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG System
    code: "void CheckAndLogBotAssignment(Player* player) {\n    int assignedBots =\
      \ lfgBotManager->GetAssignedBots(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    if (assignedBots\
      \ > 0) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s has %d bots assigned\", player->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ assignedBots);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's LFG bot management system and assumes
    that bot assignments are tracked through a mapping structure within the LFGBotManager
    class. The method likely performs lookups in internal data structures to count
    assigned bots for the specified player GUID.
  warnings: Ensure that the humanGuid parameter represents a valid player GUID; invalid
    GUIDs may result in unexpected behavior or return values of 0. This method should
    only be called within contexts where LFG bot management is active and properly
    initialized.
