  signature: void Group::ConvertToRaid()
documentation:
  brief: Converts a standard group into a raid group with full raid functionality.
  description: The ConvertToRaid method transforms an existing group into a raid group,
    enabling all raid-specific features such as raid loot rules, raid permissions,
    and raid-specific UI elements. This conversion is typically triggered when a group
    leader meets the requirements to form a raid, such as having enough players or
    meeting specific game conditions. The method updates internal group flags and
    configurations to reflect the new raid status, ensuring that all group members
    are properly initialized for raid participation. It also broadcasts necessary
    updates to all group members to synchronize their client-side UI and gameplay
    behavior.

  examples:
  - title: Convert Group to Raid
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && !group->IsRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    group->ConvertToRaid();\n    // Group is now a raid group with full raid\
      \ functionality\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group has sufficient members to
    form a valid raid. The conversion process modifies internal group state and may
    trigger UI updates for all players in the group. It's recommended to check if
    the group is already a raid group before calling this method to avoid unnecessary
    operations.
  warnings: Calling ConvertToRaid on an already existing raid group will have no effect
    but may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that all group members are properly
    notified of the conversion, as client-side UI updates depend on this change. The
    method does not validate whether the group leader has proper permissions to create
    a raid.
