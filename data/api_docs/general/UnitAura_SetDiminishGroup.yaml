  method: SetDiminishGroup
  signature: void UnitAura::SetDiminishGroup(int group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the diminishing returns group for this aura.
  description: The SetDiminishGroup method assigns a specific diminishing returns
    group to an aura, which determines how the aura interacts with other auras from
    the same group in terms of diminishing returns mechanics. In World of Warcraft,
    certain effects that stack or apply similar mechanics are subject to diminishing
    returns when multiple instances of the same group are present. This method allows
    developers to control which group an aura belongs to, influencing gameplay balance
    and effect stacking behavior. The group value typically corresponds to predefined
    constants or categories used by the game's diminishing returns system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The diminishing returns group identifier to assign to this aura.
      Valid values are typically predefined constants that map to specific groups
      in the game's diminishing returns system (e.g., 0 for none, 1-10 for various
      effect types).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning an Aura to a Diminishing Returns Group
    code: "UnitAura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetDiminishGroup(3);\
      \ // Assigns the aura to group 3\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Diminishing Group for a Custom Buff
    code: 'Aura* customAura = new Aura();

      customAura->SetDiminishGroup(7); // Apply to group 7 (e.g., crowd control effects)

      unit->AddAura(customAura, caster);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the aura is applied to a unit to ensure
    proper initialization of the diminishing returns tracking. The group identifier
    must match existing groups defined in the game's diminishing returns system for
    the effect to function correctly.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or undefined group may cause unexpected behavior in
    diminishing returns calculations. Ensure that the group value corresponds to valid
    predefined constants used by TrinityCore's aura system.
