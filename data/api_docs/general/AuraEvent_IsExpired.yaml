  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool AuraEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the aura event has expired based on its internal timer and
    duration.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if an AuraEvent has reached the end
    of its active duration. This is a critical function in TrinityCore's aura management
    system, as it helps determine when buffs, debuffs, or other timed effects should
    be removed from a unit. The method evaluates the aura's expiration time against
    the current game time and returns true if the aura is no longer active. This check
    is typically performed during aura update cycles or when accessing aura properties
    to ensure proper state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura event has expired (i.e., its duration has elapsed),
    false otherwise. This boolean value indicates whether the aura should be considered
    inactive and eligible for removal from the target unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Expiration Check
    code: "if (auraEvent->IsExpired())\n{\n    // Handle expired aura logic\n    targetUnit->RemoveAura(auraEvent);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Aura Processing
    code: "AuraEvent* aura = targetUnit->GetAuraBySpellId(spellId);\nif (aura && !aura->IsExpired())\n\
      {\n    // Process active aura\n    aura->UpdateAura();\n}\nelse if (aura &&\
      \ aura->IsExpired())\n{\n    // Clean up expired aura\n    targetUnit->RemoveAura(aura);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during the aura update process in TrinityCore's
    core systems. It relies on accurate time tracking and should be used in contexts
    where aura state consistency is important. The method does not modify any internal
    state of the aura event; it only performs a read-only check.
  warnings: Do not assume that an expired aura will automatically be removed from
    the target unit. This method only indicates expiration status - actual removal
    requires explicit calls to aura removal functions. Also, in multithreaded environments,
    ensure proper synchronization when checking aura expiration to avoid race conditions.
