documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a health-based priority multiplier used for AI action
    decision making in TrinityCore.
  description: The GetHealthPriorityMultiplier method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how priority should be adjusted based on the current health percentage
    of a unit. This multiplier is typically used within AI systems to influence behavior
    decisions, such as when to flee, heal, or engage enemies. The returned value usually
    decreases as health decreases, indicating higher priority for actions that restore
    health or avoid damage. This method is part of the ActionPriorityHelper class
    which centralizes logic for calculating various priority multipliers in the TrinityCore
    AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the health-based priority multiplier. Values
    are typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates full health (highest priority)
    and lower values indicate reduced priority as health decreases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float healthPct = unit->GetHealthPct();\nfloat priorityMult = ActionPriorityHelper::GetHealthPriorityMultiplier(healthPct);\n\
      // Use priorityMult to adjust AI action priorities\nif (priorityMult < 0.3f)\
      \ {\n    // Unit is low on health, prioritize healing actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a predefined curve or formula to map health percentages
    to priority multipliers. The exact implementation details depend on the specific
    AI behavior configuration in TrinityCore. It's designed to be efficient and thread-safe
    for use within AI update loops.
