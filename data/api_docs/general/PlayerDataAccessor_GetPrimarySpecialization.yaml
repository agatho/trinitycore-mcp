  signature: uint32 PlayerDataAccessor::GetPrimarySpecialization() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the primary specialization ID of the player.
  description: The GetPrimarySpecialization method returns the unique identifier representing
    the player's primary specialization. In World of Warcraft, each character has
    a primary specialization that determines their class-specific abilities and talents.
    This value corresponds to the specialization ID used internally by the game engine
    and is typically aligned with the specialization index in the client's spell and
    talent systems. The returned value can be used to determine which specialization
    a player is currently using for gameplay mechanics such as ability selection,
    talent calculations, or UI display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the primary specialization ID of the player.
    This ID maps to a specific specialization within the game's specialization system,
    such as 'Frost' for Death Knights or 'Arcane' for Mages.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 specId = player->GetPrimarySpecialization();\nif (specId == 251)\
      \ // Frost\n{\n    // Handle Frost Death Knight specialization logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specialization for Ability Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 primarySpec = player->GetPrimarySpecialization();\n\
      switch (primarySpec)\n{\n    case 62:  // Arcane\n        // Apply arcane-specific\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    case 63:  // Fire\n        // Apply fire-specific\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    case 64:  // Frost\n        // Apply frost-specific\
      \ logic\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's current specialization state, which may
    be updated during class changes or spec switching. The returned value is consistent
    with the internal specialization tracking system used by TrinityCore and corresponds
    to the values defined in the game's spell and talent databases.
