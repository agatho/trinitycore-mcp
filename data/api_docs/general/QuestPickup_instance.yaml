documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestPickup class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestPickup
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to manage quest pickup-related functionality. The returned instance can be used
    to access various quest pickup operations and data within the game world. This
    method is thread-safe and should be called whenever quest pickup functionality
    is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single QuestPickup instance. Returns nullptr if the instance
    could not be created or initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "QuestPickup* pickup = QuestPickup::instance();\nif (pickup)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the quest pickup functionality\n    pickup->ProcessQuestPickup(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Validity
    code: "QuestPickup* instance = QuestPickup::instance();\nif (instance != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Safe to use the instance\n    instance->HandleQuestAccept(player,\
      \ questId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to get QuestPickup instance\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern which means that subsequent calls
    will always return the same instance. The instance is typically initialized during
    server startup or on first access. This implementation is designed for use in
    TrinityCore's core systems where quest pickup logic needs to be centralized and
    accessible from multiple subsystems.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying state through this instance affects
    all parts of the application that use it. Be cautious when using this in multi-threaded
    environments where thread safety isn't guaranteed by the implementation itself.
    Avoid creating multiple instances manually as this would violate the singleton
    contract.
