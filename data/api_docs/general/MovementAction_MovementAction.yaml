  class: MovementAction
  method: MovementAction
  signature: void MovementAction::MovementAction(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a movement action with the specified name for use in AI behavior
    trees.
  description: The MovementAction constructor initializes a movement action object
    with a given name, which is used within the TrinityCore AI framework to define
    specific movement behaviors. This method sets up internal state necessary for
    the action to be executed as part of an AI decision tree. The name parameter serves
    as a unique identifier for the action and helps in debugging and logging purposes.
    This constructor is typically called when creating custom AI actions that involve
    movement logic, such as pathfinding or locomotion behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier for the movement action. This name is used internally
      to track and identify the action within the AI system. Must be a valid non-empty
      string.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Action Initialization
    code: MovementAction moveAction("FollowTarget");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Movement Actions
    code: 'MovementAction patrolAction("PatrolRoute");

      MovementAction fleeAction("FleeFromPlayer");

      MovementAction chaseAction("ChaseTarget");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the MovementAction class which is designed to
    be used within the context of TrinityCore's AI system. The name provided should
    be unique across all actions in a given AI behavior tree to avoid conflicts during
    execution.
