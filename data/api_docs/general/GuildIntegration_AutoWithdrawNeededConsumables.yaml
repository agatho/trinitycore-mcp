  signature: void GuildIntegration::AutoWithdrawNeededConsumables(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically withdraws needed consumables from the guild bank for a specified
    player.
  description: The AutoWithdrawNeededConsumables method is responsible for automatically
    retrieving necessary consumable items from the guild bank and depositing them
    into the player's inventory. This functionality is typically used to ensure that
    players have essential items such as health potions, mana potions, or other consumables
    when they join a guild or when their inventory runs low. The method handles the
    logic of identifying which items are needed based on predefined criteria and performs
    the withdrawal process accordingly. It requires a valid player reference to determine
    the correct inventory and guild bank access permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the game world. This parameter is used to locate the specific
      player's data and ensure proper access to their guild bank and inventory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AutoWithdrawNeededConsumables(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is a member of a guild and has appropriate
    permissions to access the guild bank. The actual withdrawal logic may depend on
    guild configuration settings such as minimum stock levels or item types considered
    as 'needed'. Performance considerations include potential database queries for
    inventory and guild bank data retrieval.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    object before calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This
    method does not validate if the player has sufficient funds in their guild account
    to cover any potential costs associated with withdrawing items.
