  signature: bool DemonologyDemonTracker::IsVilefiendActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's Vilefiend demon is currently active and summoned.
  description: The IsVilefiendActive method determines if the player's Vilefiend,
    a demon summoned through the Demonology warlock specialization, is currently active
    in the game world. This method is typically used to check the status of the demon
    for various gameplay mechanics such as spell targeting, damage calculations, or
    ability activation. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the
    Vilefiend is present and functional. This functionality is particularly relevant
    during Demonology warlock gameplay where the Vilefiend serves as a key pet for
    both damage dealing and utility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's Vilefiend demon is currently active and summoned;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Vilefiend Status
    code: "if (demons->IsVilefiendActive()) {\n    // Perform actions that require\
      \ an active Vilefiend\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_VILEFIEND_DAMAGE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Vilefiend Status
    code: "if (!demons->IsVilefiendActive()) {\n    // Summon Vilefiend if not active\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(nullptr, SPELL_SUMMON_VILEFIEND, true);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Use abilities that benefit from active Vilefiend\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEMONIC_POWER, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the internal state of the demon tracker to determine
    if the Vilefiend has been summoned and is currently active. It may also consider
    factors such as the demon's health or duration timers. The implementation might
    be optimized for frequent calls during combat logic.
