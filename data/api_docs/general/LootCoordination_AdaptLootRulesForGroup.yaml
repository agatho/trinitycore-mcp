  class: LootCoordination
  method: AdaptLootRulesForGroup
  signature: void LootCoordination::AdaptLootRulesForGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts loot rules and distribution settings based on the group composition
    and member requirements.
  description: The AdaptLootRulesForGroup method modifies the loot coordination behavior
    according to the characteristics of the provided group. This includes adjusting
    loot thresholds, item quality requirements, and distribution strategies to align
    with group dynamics such as player levels, gear requirements, and raid composition.
    The method ensures that loot is distributed fairly and appropriately within the
    context of the group's current needs and capabilities. It typically gets invoked
    when a new group is formed or when group members change, ensuring that loot rules
    adapt dynamically to maintain optimal gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose composition and characteristics
      will be used to adjust loot distribution rules. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adapting Loot Rules for a New Group
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   lootCoordination->AdaptLootRulesForGroup(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Loot Rules After Group Member Changes
    code: "void OnPlayerAddedToGroup(Player* player, Group* group)\n{\n    lootCoordination->AdaptLootRulesForGroup(group);\n\
      }\n\nvoid OnPlayerRemovedFromGroup(Player* player, Group* group)\n{\n    lootCoordination->AdaptLootRulesForGroup(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group creation or modification events.
    It may internally update internal state variables related to loot thresholds and
    item quality requirements. The implementation likely checks for group size, average
    player level, and other relevant factors to determine appropriate loot rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and not null; passing a
    null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies
    internal loot coordination state, so calling it too frequently may have performance
    implications in high-traffic scenarios.
