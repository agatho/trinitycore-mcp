  brief: Checks if the hunter has focus on a target.
  description: The HasFocus method determines whether the hunter AI currently has
    focus on a target, which is typically used to verify if the hunter is actively
    engaged with a specific enemy. This method evaluates the current state of the
    hunter's targeting and focus mechanisms within the AI system. It plays a crucial
    role in decision-making processes for abilities that require focused attention
    on a single target, such as certain hunter abilities or pet behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has focus on a target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check focus state
    code: "if (hunterAI->HasFocus()) {\n    // Perform actions that require focused\
      \ targeting\n    DoFocusedAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI decision-making
    functions to determine appropriate combat behavior. The focus state may be influenced
    by target selection, threat levels, and ability requirements.
