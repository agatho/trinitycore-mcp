  signature: uint8 ReputationMgr::GetReveredFactionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of factions that have reached the Revered reputation standing.
  description: The GetReveredFactionCount method retrieves the number of factions
    in a player's reputation list that have achieved the 'Revered' standing. This
    is a common metric used in World of Warcraft to track character progression and
    faction relationships. The method iterates through all known factions for the
    player and counts those with a reputation level of Revered or higher. This count
    can be useful for quest completion checks, achievement tracking, or UI displays
    showing faction progress. The method does not modify any internal state and is
    read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of factions that have reached Revered
    standing or higher. Returns 0 if no factions meet this criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint8 reveredCount = player->GetReputationMgr().GetReveredFactionCount();\n\
      if (reveredCount > 0) {\n    // Player has at least one revered faction\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Player has %u revered factions.\", reveredCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Progression Check
    code: "uint8 reveredFactions = player->GetReputationMgr().GetReveredFactionCount();\n\
      if (reveredFactions >= 5) {\n    // Award achievement or complete quest\n  \
      \  player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called frequently in tight
    loops, as it iterates through all faction entries. The method is thread-safe when
    used on a player object that is not being modified concurrently by other threads.
  warnings: Be aware that this count includes all factions at Revered or higher standing
    (including Exalted). If you need to distinguish between different reputation levels,
    consider using GetFactionStanding() with specific faction IDs instead.
