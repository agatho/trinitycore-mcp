  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendQuestGiverOfferReward(const Quest * quest, int npcGUID,
    bool autoLaunched)
documentation:
  brief: Sends the quest offer reward dialog to the player for a specified quest.
  description: The SendQuestGiverOfferReward method is responsible for displaying
    the quest reward selection interface to the player when they interact with a quest
    givers. This method prepares and sends the appropriate UI packet that allows players
    to choose their reward options from the available rewards defined in the quest.
    It handles the logic for determining which rewards are valid for the player based
    on their current quest state and progress. The method also manages the autoLaunch
    parameter, which controls whether the reward selection is automatically triggered
    without requiring explicit player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the reward information
      to be displayed. Must not be null.
  - name: npcGUID
    description: The global unique identifier of the NPC who is offering the quest
      rewards. Used to identify the correct quest giver in the UI.
  - name: autoLaunched
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the reward selection should be automatically
      launched without requiring player interaction. True enables auto-launch, false
      requires manual confirmation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      playerMenu->SendQuestGiverOfferReward(quest, 67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Auto Launch Reward Selection
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12346);

      playerMenu->SendQuestGiverOfferReward(quest, 67891, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the serialization of quest reward data and
    sends it through the network to the client. The method assumes that the quest
    has been properly validated and that all required data is available. It's typically
    called after a player completes a quest or when they interact with a quest givers
    who offers rewards.
  warnings: The quest parameter must not be null, as passing a null pointer will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. The npcGUID should correspond to an actual
    NPC in the world to ensure proper UI display and functionality.
