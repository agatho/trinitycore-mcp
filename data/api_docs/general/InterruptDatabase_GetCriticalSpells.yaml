  class: InterruptDatabase
  method: GetCriticalSpells
  signature: int InterruptDatabase::GetCriticalSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of critical spells stored in the interrupt database.
  description: The GetCriticalSpells method returns an integer value representing
    the total number of critical spells currently loaded or registered within the
    InterruptDatabase. This database typically stores information about spells that
    can interrupt other spell casts, particularly those with critical effects or high-priority
    interruption mechanics. The method serves as a query interface to determine how
    many such spells are available for use in combat systems or spell interruption
    logic. It does not modify any internal state and is generally used for validation,
    debugging, or statistical purposes within the game's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total count of critical spells present
    in the interrupt database. Returns zero if no critical spells are registered or
    if the database is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptDatabase db;

      int criticalSpellCount = db.GetCriticalSpells();

      printf("Number of critical spells: %d\n", criticalSpellCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a read-only accessor that provides a snapshot count
    of critical spells. It may be used in conjunction with other database methods
    to validate spell configurations or during server initialization when loading
    spell data. The actual implementation might involve iterating through internal
    containers or cached data structures.
