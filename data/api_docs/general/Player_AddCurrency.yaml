documentation:
  brief: Adds currency to the player's inventory
  description: The AddCurrency method allows a player to receive currency items, such
    as honor points or arena points, by adding them to their inventory. This method
    is commonly used in game mechanics where players earn currency through various
    activities like PvP battles, quest completion, or world events. The method handles
    the addition of currency with proper validation and ensures that the currency
    is correctly added to the player's account.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The currency ID representing the type of currency being added (e.g.,
      honor points, arena points). This must be a valid currency entry in the game
      database.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of currency to add. This value must be greater than
      zero and represents the number of units being added.
  - name: gainSource
    description: The source from which the currency was gained, used for tracking
      purposes and determining how the currency should be handled in terms of logging
      or event triggers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddCurrency(2100, 100, 1); // Adds 100 honor points to player''s inventory'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddCurrency(2100, 500, 3); // Adds 500 honor points with gain source
      3

      // This could be used for tracking PvP rewards or event-based currency gains'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other currency-related
    methods like AddItem or AddQuestCurrency. It does not directly update the player's
    currency display but rather adds the currency to their inventory, which will be
    visible upon next login or when the player opens their currency window.
  warnings: The currency ID must match a valid entry in the game database; otherwise,
    the method may silently fail or produce unexpected results. Also, this method
    does not validate whether the player has sufficient space in their inventory for
    the currency being added.
