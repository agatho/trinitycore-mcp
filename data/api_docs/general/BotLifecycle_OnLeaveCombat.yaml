documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state transitions when a bot leaves combat.
  description: The OnLeaveCombat method is invoked when a bot transitions out of combat
    state. This method typically performs necessary cleanup operations such as resetting
    combat-related flags, releasing combat targets, and updating the bot's behavior
    state. It ensures that the bot properly exits combat mode and returns to its default
    non-combat state. The method is part of the bot lifecycle management system and
    is automatically called by the core when combat ends for a bot.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "void MyBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!me->IsInCombat())\n  \
      \  {\n        botLifecycle->OnLeaveCombat();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot's combat state changes. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom bot behavior logic that requires explicit combat exit
    handling.
