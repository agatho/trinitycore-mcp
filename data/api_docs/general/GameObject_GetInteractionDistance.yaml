api:
  class: GameObject
  method: GetInteractionDistance
  signature: float GameObject::GetInteractionDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the interaction distance for the GameObject, determining how close
    players must be to interact with it.
  description: The GetInteractionDistance method returns the distance at which players
    can interact with a GameObject. This value is crucial for determining the range
    within which players can perform actions like opening doors or using quest items.
    The method retrieves the interaction distance from the GameObject's data, which
    is typically set based on the game object type and its associated quest or interaction
    requirements. It ensures that players cannot interact with objects beyond their
    defined distance limits, maintaining game balance and preventing exploits.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the interaction distance in yards. This
    value defines how close players must be to the GameObject to perform interactions
    such as opening or using it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float distance = gameObject->GetInteractionDistance();\nif (distance >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Use distance for interaction checks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject interaction
    methods to determine player proximity. Performance considerations are minimal
    as the value is precomputed and cached during object initialization.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with distance
    calculations, as incorrect use may lead to players interacting with objects beyond
    their intended range.
