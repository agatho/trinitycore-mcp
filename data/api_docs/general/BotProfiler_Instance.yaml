  class: BotProfiler
  method: Instance
  signature: BotProfiler & BotProfiler::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotProfiler class for managing bot
    performance profiling.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotProfiler
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the profiler exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is used to access the global profiling manager that tracks
    and records performance metrics for AI bots within the TrinityCore environment.
    The returned reference provides access to all profiling functionalities including
    timing measurements, resource usage tracking, and performance analysis capabilities.
    This is particularly useful in World of Warcraft server environments where bot
    behavior and performance monitoring are critical for maintaining server stability
    and optimizing AI algorithms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BotProfiler instance, allowing direct access
    to all profiling methods and data members without creating additional objects.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotProfiler Instance
    code: 'BotProfiler& profiler = BotProfiler::Instance();

      profiler.StartTiming("bot_movement");

      // ... bot logic here ...

      profiler.StopTiming("bot_movement");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it returns a singleton instance that should
    be initialized once during application startup. The singleton pattern ensures
    consistent access to profiling data across all bot instances and threads within
    the TrinityCore framework.
