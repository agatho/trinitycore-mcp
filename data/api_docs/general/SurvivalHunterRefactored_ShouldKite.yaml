  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: ShouldKite
  signature: bool SurvivalHunterRefactored::ShouldKite(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the survival hunter should kite their target based on
    current combat state and positioning.
  description: The ShouldKite method evaluates the current combat situation for a
    survival hunter AI to decide if it is beneficial to maintain distance from the
    target rather than engaging in melee combat. This decision is typically influenced
    by factors such as the hunter's health, the target's attack power, available ranged
    abilities, and positioning relative to terrain or other environmental factors.
    The method returns true when kiting is recommended, false otherwise. It does not
    modify any state directly but serves as a decision-making component within the
    AI's overall combat logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the survival hunter should kite their target; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldKite()) {\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n    hunter->StartKiting();\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with melee or ranged attack\n    hunter->AttackTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the survival hunter's tactical decision-making system
    and should be called frequently during combat updates. It may consider factors
    like target proximity, hunter health percentage, and cooldown status of defensive
    abilities.
