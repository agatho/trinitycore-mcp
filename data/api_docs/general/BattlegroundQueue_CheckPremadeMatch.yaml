  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: CheckPremadeMatch
  signature: bool BattlegroundQueue::CheckPremadeMatch(int bracket_id, uint32 MinPlayersPerTeam,
    uint32 MaxPlayersPerTeam)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a premade group can be matched for a battleground queue.
  description: The CheckPremadeMatch method evaluates whether a premade group of players
    meets the criteria to be matched into a battleground queue. It verifies that the
    group size is within the specified minimum and maximum player limits per team,
    ensuring the group is eligible for queue participation. This method is typically
    used during battleground queue processing to validate premade groups before attempting
    to form a match.
  parameters:
  - name: bracket_id
    description: The identifier of the bracket to check for premade matching. Used
      to determine which battleground bracket the group should be queued for.
  - name: MinPlayersPerTeam
    description: The minimum number of players required per team in the premade group.
  - name: MaxPlayersPerTeam
    description: The maximum number of players allowed per team in the premade group.
  returns: Returns true if the premade group meets the criteria for queue matching,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check premade group eligibility for a battleground
    code: "if (bgQueue->CheckPremadeMatch(2, 5, 10)) {\n    // Group is eligible to\
      \ be queued\n    printf(\"Group can be queued for battleground.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Group does not meet requirements\n    printf(\"Group cannot be queued.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been validated for other criteria
    such as level requirements, instance restrictions, and player availability. It
    primarily focuses on team size validation.
  warnings: Ensure that bracket_id corresponds to a valid battleground bracket; otherwise,
    the method may return unexpected results. The MinPlayersPerTeam should not exceed
    MaxPlayersPerTeam.
