  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GenerateQuestPath
  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::GenerateQuestPath(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a quest path for the specified player and quest ID, returning the
    number of steps in the path.
  description: 'The GenerateQuestPath method calculates and initializes the quest
    path for a given player and quest ID. This method is typically used in dynamic
    quest systems to determine the sequence of objectives and locations that a player
    must follow to complete a quest. It handles path generation logic, including waypoint
    calculation, objective tracking, and state management. The method ensures that
    all necessary quest data is properly initialized and accessible for the player''s
    current quest progress. Precondition: The player must be valid and the quest ID
    must correspond to an existing quest in the database. Postcondition: The quest
    path is generated and stored internally for the player''s session.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the quest path is being generated.
      Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the path is being generated.
      Must correspond to an existing quest in the database.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of steps or waypoints in the
    generated quest path. A return value of 0 indicates no path was generated, while
    positive values indicate the number of steps in the path.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Path Generation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      int steps = dynamicQuestSystem->GenerateQuestPath(player, questId);\nif (steps\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Path successfully generated with 'steps' waypoints\n    printf(\"\
      Generated quest path with %d steps\\n\", steps);\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ generate path\n    printf(\"Failed to generate quest path\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Generation with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      int result = dynamicQuestSystem->GenerateQuestPath(player, questId);\nswitch\
      \ (result) {\n    case -1:\n        // Invalid quest ID\n        break;\n  \
      \  case 0:\n        // No path generated\n        break;\n    default:\n   \
      \     // Success with 'result' steps\n        break;\n}"

  notes: This method is part of a dynamic quest system and may interact with internal
    quest state management. The generated path is typically used for guiding players
    through objectives, calculating rewards, or managing quest progression. Performance
    considerations include database lookups for quest data and path calculations.
    This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state to receive
    quest data.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid segmentation faults. The questId must exist in the database; otherwise,
    the method may return unexpected results or fail silently. This method modifies
    internal quest state and should not be called concurrently with other quest-related
    operations without proper synchronization.
