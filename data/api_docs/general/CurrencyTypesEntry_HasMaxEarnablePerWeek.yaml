  signature: bool CurrencyTypesEntry::HasMaxEarnablePerWeek() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type has a maximum earnable amount per week
    defined.
  description: The HasMaxEarnablePerWeek method checks if the currency type entry
    specifies a maximum amount of currency that can be earned by players within a
    single week. This is typically used in conjunction with weekly currency limits
    in World of Warcraft's currency system, such as for PvP rewards or achievement-based
    currencies. The method returns true if a weekly cap exists for this currency type,
    and false otherwise. This functionality supports the game's economy and reward
    balancing mechanics by preventing unlimited currency accumulation through weekly
    activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type has a defined maximum earnable amount
    per week; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Currency Has Weekly Limit
    code: "if (currencyEntry->HasMaxEarnablePerWeek()) {\n    // Apply weekly limit\
      \ logic\n    uint32 maxWeekly = currencyEntry->GetMaxEarnablePerWeek();\n  \
      \  // Process weekly currency cap\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in player currency tracking systems to enforce
    weekly caps on various reward currencies. It's particularly relevant for PvP and
    achievement-based currencies where limiting weekly gains helps maintain game balance.
