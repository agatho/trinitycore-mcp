  class: KitingManager
  method: AnalyzeThreats
  signature: int KitingManager::AnalyzeThreats(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes threat levels from enemies and returns a threat assessment value
    for kiting behavior decisions.
  description: The AnalyzeThreats method evaluates the current threat situation by
    examining enemy units and determining an appropriate threat level indicator. This
    assessment is used by the KitingManager to make informed decisions about movement
    patterns, attack priorities, and defensive actions during combat. The method considers
    factors such as enemy aggro status, damage output, positioning, and proximity
    to determine a numerical threat score that guides kiting strategies. It is typically
    called during combat updates to dynamically adjust the AI's behavior based on
    evolving threat conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of enemies currently
      in combat or within threat range. This value is used to determine the complexity
      and urgency of threat assessment required.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the assessed threat level. A higher
    value indicates increased danger, potentially triggering defensive kiting behaviors
    or retreat actions. Values typically range from 0 (no threat) to a maximum determined
    by enemy count and combat intensity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Assessment
    code: "int threatLevel = kitingManager.AnalyzeThreats(3); // Analyze threat from\
      \ 3 enemies\nif (threatLevel > 50) {\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n    player->SetMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_KITING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Threat Response
    code: "void UpdateCombatAI() {\n    int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n    int\
      \ threatAssessment = kitingManager.AnalyzeThreats(enemyCount);\n    \n    if\
      \ (threatAssessment > 75) {\n        // Execute emergency retreat\n        MoveToSafeDistance();\n\
      \    } else if (threatAssessment > 30) {\n        // Switch to defensive kiting\n\
      \        StartDefensiveKiting();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat updates, ideally
    every few seconds. The threat assessment algorithm considers enemy positioning
    and damage potential rather than just raw health or mana values. The returned
    integer value may vary based on internal AI configuration parameters that can
    be adjusted for different difficulty levels or NPC behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the enemies parameter accurately reflects the current combat
    situation, as incorrect values will lead to inappropriate kiting decisions. This
    method should not be called outside of combat contexts where threat assessment
    is meaningless.
