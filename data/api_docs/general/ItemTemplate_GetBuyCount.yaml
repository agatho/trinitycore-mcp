documentation:
  brief: Returns the quantity of items a player can purchase from a vendor for a single
    transaction.
  description: The GetBuyCount method retrieves the maximum number of items that can
    be bought in one purchase from a vendor. This value is typically defined in the
    item's template data and represents the 'buy count' field in the database. It
    determines how many of that item a player can acquire at once when interacting
    with a vendor, regardless of their inventory space or available currency. The
    returned value is usually 1 for most items but may be higher for stackable items
    or special vendor offerings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of items that can be purchased
    from a vendor in a single transaction. This value is typically 1 for most items,
    but can be greater than 1 for stackable items or specific vendor deals.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Buy Count
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 buyCount = itemTemplate->GetBuyCount();

      printf("Maximum buy count for item 12345: %u\n", buyCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Buy Count in Vendor Interaction Logic
    code: "void HandleVendorBuyItem(Player* player, uint32 itemId, uint32 count)\n\
      {\n    ItemTemplate const* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(itemId);\n\
      \    if (!itemTemplate) return;\n    \n    uint32 maxBuyCount = itemTemplate->GetBuyCount();\n\
      \    uint32 actualCount = std::min(count, maxBuyCount);\n    // Proceed with\
      \ vendor transaction using actualCount\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses the ItemTemplate's internal 'buy count' field
    which is populated from the 'buycount' column in the game database's item_template
    table. The value affects vendor transactions but does not influence auction house
    or other trading systems.
