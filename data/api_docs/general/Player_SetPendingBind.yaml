  class: Player
  method: SetPendingBind
  signature: void Player::SetPendingBind(uint32 instanceId, uint32 bindTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the pending bind for a player to a specific instance with a specified
    timer.
  description: The SetPendingBind method is used to establish a pending binding state
    for a player to a specific instance in World of Warcraft. This method is typically
    called when a player enters an instance that requires binding, such as a raid
    or dungeon, and sets up the binding timer for future reference. The method ensures
    that the player's binding status is properly updated according to game mechanics,
    which may involve setting up a timer for the binding to occur at a later time.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining proper game state management during
    instance play.
  parameters:
  - name: instanceId
    description: The unique identifier of the instance that the player is pending
      to bind to. This value represents the specific dungeon or raid instance the
      player is entering.
  - name: bindTimer
    description: The time in seconds that the binding will be delayed. This timer
      determines when the actual binding will occur, typically used for timed binding
      operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetPendingBind(12345, 3600);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 instanceId = 54321;

      uint32 bindTimer = 7200;

      player->SetPendingBind(instanceId, bindTimer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance entry mechanics and should
    be used in conjunction with other binding-related methods. The implementation
    involves updating the player's pending binding state, which may affect the player's
    ability to leave the instance without proper binding.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect binding states, potentially
    causing players to remain bound to instances indefinitely or lose access to certain
    content. Care should be taken when setting bind timers to ensure correct game
    mechanics are maintained.
