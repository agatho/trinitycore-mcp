  class: StrategyFactory
  method: CreatePvPStrategies
  signature: int StrategyFactory::CreatePvPStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes PvP strategies for AI-controlled players in World
    of Warcraft.
  description: The CreatePvPStrategies method is responsible for generating and setting
    up predefined strategy configurations that govern how AI-controlled players behave
    during Player versus Player (PvP) encounters. This includes defining combat tactics,
    spell usage patterns, item selection behaviors, and movement strategies specific
    to PvP scenarios. The method typically initializes these strategies based on the
    current game context, player level, faction, and available resources. It ensures
    that AI players have appropriate behavioral frameworks to engage in competitive
    gameplay effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of PvP strategies successfully
    created and initialized. A return value of zero indicates no strategies were created,
    while a positive integer reflects the count of successfully configured strategies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "StrategyFactory factory;\nint strategyCount = factory.CreatePvPStrategies();\n\
      if (strategyCount > 0) {\n    // Successfully created PvP strategies\n    printf(\"\
      Created %d PvP strategies\\n\", strategyCount);\n} else {\n    // No strategies\
      \ created\n    printf(\"Failed to create PvP strategies\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or when a new PvP
    encounter begins. The created strategies are usually stored internally within
    the StrategyFactory instance and can be retrieved later using other methods like
    GetPvPStrategy(). Implementation may involve loading predefined strategy templates
    from configuration files or databases.
  warnings: The method should only be called after proper initialization of the StrategyFactory
    and its dependencies. Calling this method multiple times without cleaning up previous
    strategies might lead to memory leaks or duplicate strategy entries. Ensure that
    all required game data (player levels, faction information, etc.) is properly
    set before invoking this method.
