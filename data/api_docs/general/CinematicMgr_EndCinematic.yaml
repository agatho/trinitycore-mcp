documentation:
  brief: Ends the currently playing cinematic sequence for the player
  description: The EndCinematic method terminates the active cinematic sequence that
    is currently being played for a player. This method is typically invoked when
    a cinematic has completed or needs to be forcefully stopped, ensuring that the
    player's camera and controls are properly restored to their normal state. It handles
    cleanup of cinematic-related data and may trigger any associated events or callbacks.
    The method assumes that a cinematic is currently active and will not perform any
    action if no cinematic is playing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ending a cinematic sequence
    code: 'CinematicMgr* cinematicMgr = sCinematicMgr;

      cinematicMgr->EndCinematic();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a cinematic is actively playing. Calling
    it outside of a cinematic context may result in undefined behavior or silent failures.
    The implementation ensures that player state is correctly restored, including
    camera position, movement controls, and UI elements.
  warnings: Invoking EndCinematic without verifying that a cinematic is active can
    lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure proper synchronization with cinematic start
    events to avoid race conditions.
