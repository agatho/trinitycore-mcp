documentation:
  brief: Shuts down all player bot systems and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all active
    player bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. It ensures that all
    bot threads are properly stopped, memory allocations are freed, and any ongoing
    bot activities are safely concluded before the system shuts down. This method
    typically gets invoked during server shutdown procedures to prevent resource leaks
    and ensure clean termination of bot-related processes. The method does not accept
    any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: PlayerBotHooks::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown or when explicitly
    managing player bot lifecycle. It is not intended for runtime bot suspension or
    temporary disabling of individual bots.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively processing commands may result
    in loss of current actions or incomplete AI states. Ensure all bot operations
    are safely concluded before invoking Shutdown.
