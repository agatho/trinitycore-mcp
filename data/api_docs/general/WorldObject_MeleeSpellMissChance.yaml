documentation:
  brief: Calculates the chance for a melee attack to miss a target.
  description: This method computes the probability that a melee attack will miss
    its target, taking into account various factors such as the attacker's level,
    the victim's level, and the type of attack. It is used in combat calculations
    to determine whether an attack hits or misses during melee combat. The method
    considers both the attacker's and victim's attributes, including their levels,
    and the specific attack type (melee, ranged, etc.) to determine the miss chance.
    This function is essential for determining combat outcomes in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is being attacked. This represents the target
      of the melee attack and must be a valid Unit object.
  - name: attType
    description: The type of attack being performed. This determines whether the attack
      is melee, ranged, or other types of attacks and affects how the miss chance
      is calculated.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell being used
      for the attack. This parameter allows for specific spell-based calculations
      of miss chance, particularly when dealing with spells that have different miss
      mechanics than regular melee attacks.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the probability (as a percentage) that
    the melee attack will miss the target. A value of 0.0 indicates no chance to miss,
    while higher values indicate increasing likelihood of missing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float missChance = attacker->MeleeSpellMissChance(target, ATTACK_MELEE,\
      \ nullptr);\n// This calculates the chance for a melee attack to miss target\n\
      if (missChance > 0.5f) {\n    // The attack has a greater than 50% chance to\
      \ miss\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell-specific usage example
    code: "const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nfloat missChance\
      \ = attacker->MeleeSpellMissChance(target, ATTACK_MELEE, spellInfo);\n// This\
      \ calculates the chance for a specific spell to miss target\nif (missChance\
      \ > 0.3f) {\n    // The spell has a greater than 30% chance to miss\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and may involve complex
    interactions between attacker and victim attributes. Performance considerations
    include the use of cached values for certain calculations, especially when dealing
    with multiple attacks or targets. Thread safety depends on the implementation
    details of the WorldObject class and its derived classes.
  warnings: The method assumes that both the attacker and victim are valid Unit objects.
    If either is null or invalid, the behavior may be undefined or result in incorrect
    calculations. Care should be taken when using this method with different attack
    types, as it may not behave consistently across all types of attacks.
