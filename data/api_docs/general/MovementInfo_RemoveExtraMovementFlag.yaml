api:
  class: MovementInfo
  method: RemoveExtraMovementFlag
  signature: void MovementInfo::RemoveExtraMovementFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified extra movement flag from the MovementInfo object.
  description: The RemoveExtraMovementFlag method is used to clear or remove a specific
    movement flag that has been previously set within the MovementInfo structure.
    This functionality is typically utilized in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation to manage player or creature movement states, such as disabling
    flags related to flying, swimming, or other special movement types. The method
    modifies the internal state of the MovementInfo object by unsetting the provided
    flag bit. It is commonly called during movement updates or when transitioning
    between different movement modes to ensure accurate representation of an entity's
    current movement capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The movement flag value to be removed from the MovementInfo object.
      This should be a valid flag constant defined in the movement system, such as
      MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING, MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Flying Flag
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.SetExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      // ... some logic ...

      movementInfo.RemoveExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING); // Disable flying
      flag'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Multiple Flags
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.SetExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      movementInfo.SetExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);

      // ... some logic ...

      movementInfo.RemoveExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      movementInfo.RemoveExtraMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING); // Disable both
      flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal bitfield of the MovementInfo
    object. It is important to ensure that the flag being removed is one that was
    previously set using SetExtraMovementFlag or similar methods. The operation is
    atomic and does not involve any external synchronization mechanisms, so care should
    be taken in multi-threaded environments where movement data might be accessed
    concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided flag value is valid and corresponds to an actual
    movement flag defined in the TrinityCore movement system. Attempting to remove
    a non-existent or invalid flag may result in unexpected behavior or no effect
    at all. Avoid removing flags while another thread might be reading the movement
    state without proper synchronization.
