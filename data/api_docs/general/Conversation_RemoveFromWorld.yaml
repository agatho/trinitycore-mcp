documentation:
  brief: Removes the conversation object from the game world, making it no longer
    active or visible to players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method is responsible for removing a Conversation
    object from the active game world state. This method typically handles cleanup
    operations such as unregistering the conversation from world managers, notifying
    relevant subsystems that the conversation is no longer in use, and ensuring that
    any associated resources are properly released. When called, this method ensures
    that the conversation will no longer be processed or displayed to players, effectively
    deactivating it within the game environment. This method should only be called
    when the conversation is no longer needed and has completed its intended purpose.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectMgr->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n{\n\
      \    conv->RemoveFromWorld();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when a conversation
    reaches its end state or when it's explicitly destroyed. It's important to note
    that after calling RemoveFromWorld, the Conversation object should not be used
    for further operations as it may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld on a conversation that is currently active in
    a player's context can cause client-side issues or crashes if the player is still
    interacting with the conversation. Always ensure proper state management before
    invoking this method.
