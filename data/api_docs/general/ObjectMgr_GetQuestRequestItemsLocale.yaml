documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale-specific quest request items data for a given quest
    entry.
  description: The GetQuestRequestItemsLocale method fetches localized quest request
    item information associated with a specific quest entry. This function is used
    to retrieve the appropriate text or data related to items required for completing
    a quest, taking into account the player's locale settings. The returned pointer
    points to an array of integers that represent localized quest request item details
    such as item IDs, quantities, or other metadata. The method does not perform any
    validation on the input entry and assumes it refers to a valid quest in the database.
    It is typically used during quest interaction to display proper localized messages
    about required items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing locale-specific quest
    request item data for the specified quest entry. Returns nullptr if no data exists
    for the given quest entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Process Quest Request Items Locale
    code: "const int* questItems = sObjectMgr->GetQuestRequestItemsLocale(12345);\n\
      if (questItems != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the localized quest request items\
      \ data\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n    {\n        if (questItems[i] >\
      \ 0)\n            printf(\"Item ID: %d\\n\", questItems[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are populated during server
    startup from the database. The returned array may contain up to five integer values
    representing different aspects of quest request items (e.g., item IDs, counts).
    Ensure thread safety when accessing this data in multi-threaded contexts as it's
    part of the global ObjectMgr singleton.
  warnings: The returned pointer should not be modified or freed by the caller. It
    points to internal static memory managed by the ObjectMgr class. Accessing invalid
    quest entries may result in undefined behavior or null returns.
