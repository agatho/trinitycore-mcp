  signature: BotSpawnOrchestrator & BotSpawnOrchestrator::operator=(const BotSpawnOrchestrator
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the state of one BotSpawnOrchestrator object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotSpawnOrchestrator class copies all
    member variables from the source object to the current object. This method ensures
    that both objects share identical state, including any internal data structures
    or configuration settings related to bot spawning orchestration. The operation
    follows standard C++ copy semantics and returns a reference to the assigned object
    to allow for chaining operations. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and bot management
    system, this operator is crucial for duplicating orchestrator configurations or
    transferring spawn settings between different instances.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSpawnOrchestrator object whose state will be copied
      to the current object
  returns: A reference to the current BotSpawnOrchestrator object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling operator chaining
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator1;

      BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator2 = orchestrator1; // Uses assignment operator

      // or alternatively:

      orchestrator2 = orchestrator1;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator a, b, c;

      // Assign multiple times in sequence

      a = b = c; // Chaining assignment operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs deep copying of internal data structures to
    ensure that modifications to one instance do not affect another. It's important
    to note that if the class manages resources or pointers, proper handling of memory
    allocation/deallocation must be implemented in the assignment operator to prevent
    memory leaks or dangling pointers.
  warnings: When implementing custom assignment operators, developers should be cautious
    about self-assignment scenarios (e.g., obj = obj). While this is not typically
    an issue with simple value assignments, it's a common pitfall that can lead to
    undefined behavior if not handled properly.
