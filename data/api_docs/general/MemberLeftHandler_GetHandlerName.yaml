  class: MemberLeftHandler

  signature: std::string MemberLeftHandler::GetHandlerName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the member left handler for identification purposes.
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves a string identifier that uniquely
    represents this particular handler within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier
    is typically used for logging, debugging, or registering the handler in system-wide
    dispatchers. The returned string should be consistent across all instances of
    the MemberLeftHandler class and is intended to provide a human-readable label
    for the handler's purpose. In the context of World of Warcraft's group management
    system, this handler likely corresponds to events where a player leaves a group,
    guild, or raid instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of the MemberLeftHandler
    instance, typically used for system identification and logging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MemberLeftHandler handler;

      std::string name = handler.GetHandlerName();

      // Returns a string like "MemberLeftHandler" or similar identifier'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be implemented as a pure virtual or concrete function
    in the base class, and should return a constant string value. It's commonly used
    in conjunction with handler registration systems where handlers need to be identified
    by name for event routing.
