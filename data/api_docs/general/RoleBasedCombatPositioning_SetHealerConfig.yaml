  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: SetHealerConfig
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetHealerConfig(const HealerPositionConfig
    & config)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the healer positioning settings for role-based combat mechanics.
  description: The SetHealerConfig method initializes or updates the configuration
    used for determining optimal healer positions within the role-based combat system.
    This configuration defines how healers should position themselves relative to
    the target and other group members during combat scenarios. The method accepts
    a HealerPositionConfig object that contains all necessary parameters for positioning
    logic, including distance thresholds, preferred angles, and interaction rules
    with other players. This method is typically called during group initialization
    or when combat roles are reassigned to ensure that healer positioning aligns with
    current tactical requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A const reference to a HealerPositionConfig object containing all
      positioning parameters for healers in role-based combat. This includes distance
      constraints, angle preferences, and interaction rules with other players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic healer configuration setup
    code: 'HealerPositionConfig config;

      config.minDistance = 5.0f;

      config.maxDistance = 25.0f;

      config.preferredAngle = 180.0f;

      roleBasedCombat->SetHealerConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating healer configuration during combat
    code: 'HealerPositionConfig newConfig = roleBasedCombat->GetHealerConfig();

      newConfig.minDistance = 8.0f;

      newConfig.maxDistance = 30.0f;

      roleBasedCombat->SetHealerConfig(newConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the positioning behavior of healers in group
    combat scenarios. The configuration is applied immediately and will influence
    all subsequent healer positioning decisions until changed again. It's recommended
    to call this method during group initialization or when role assignments change
    rather than during active combat.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat may cause unexpected positioning
    behavior for healers. Ensure that the HealerPositionConfig object passed is properly
    initialized with valid values to avoid undefined behavior. The configuration parameters
    should be carefully tuned based on encounter mechanics and group composition.
