api:
  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: InitializeMiningZones
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::InitializeMiningZones()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes mining zones for the farming coordinator, setting up required
    data structures and configurations for mining operations.
  description: The InitializeMiningZones method prepares the internal state of the
    FarmingCoordinator class to handle mining-related activities. This includes loading
    or creating data structures that define which areas are eligible for mining, configuring
    resource spawn rates, and establishing necessary mappings between game zones and
    their respective mining properties. The method is typically called during server
    initialization or when a new mining zone needs to be activated within the farming
    system. It ensures that all required resources are available before any mining
    operations can begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitializeMiningZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the farming system. Repeated calls may result in duplicate data structures or
    undefined behavior. The method assumes that core game systems such as zone management
    and resource definitions are already initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method after mining operations have begun may lead to inconsistent
    state or crashes. Ensure all dependent systems are ready before invoking this
    function.
