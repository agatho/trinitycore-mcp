  class: AuctionEvent
  method: ListReceived
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::ListReceived(int playerGuid, uint32 itemCount)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of received auction items for a specific player.
  description: The ListReceived method fetches all auction items that have been delivered
    to a player's mailbox, typically after an auction has ended and the item was successfully
    sold. This method is used within the auction house system to provide players with
    information about items they have won or received through auctions. It filters
    results based on the provided player GUID and limits the number of returned items
    according to the itemCount parameter. The method ensures that only valid, completed
    auction transactions are included in the result set.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose received auction
      items are being retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player in the
      game database.
  - name: itemCount
    description: The maximum number of auction items to return in the result set.
      If set to 0, all received items will be returned. This parameter helps manage
      memory usage and performance for large inventories.
  returns: An AuctionEvent object containing information about the received auction
    items, including item details, auction status, and delivery timestamps. Returns
    an empty AuctionEvent if no items are found or if the player GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve all received auction items for a player
    code: AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::ListReceived(123456, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Limit received auction items to the last 10 items
    code: AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::ListReceived(123456, 10);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login or when accessing the
    auction house interface. The implementation may involve database queries to fetch
    auction data from the 'auctionhouse' table and related tables. Performance can
    be affected by large numbers of auction transactions, so using a reasonable itemCount
    limit is recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual logged-in
    player to avoid retrieving incorrect or stale data. Using a very high itemCount
    value may cause performance degradation on servers with many active auctions.
