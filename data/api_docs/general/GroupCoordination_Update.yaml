documentation:
  brief: Updates the group coordination state based on the elapsed time since last
    update
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of group coordination within the TrinityCore framework. It handles time-based
    logic such as synchronization of group members, cooldown management, and status
    updates. This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals
    to ensure that group-related systems remain consistent and responsive. The implementation
    likely processes queued actions, checks for member disconnections, and manages
    group-wide events or abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    groupCoordination->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop. It's
    designed to be non-blocking and efficient, as it's invoked frequently during gameplay.
    The diff parameter represents milliseconds since last update which is crucial
    for accurate timing of group events.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game thread context as it
    may cause race conditions or inconsistent state. Ensure that the GroupCoordination
    object is properly initialized before calling Update.
