  method: GetHigh
  signature: HighGuid ObjectGuid::GetHigh() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the high portion of the ObjectGuid identifier.
  description: 'The GetHigh method extracts and returns the high 32 bits of the ObjectGuid,
    which represents the type and source identifier of the object. In TrinityCore''s
    GUID system, ObjectGuids are composed of a 64-bit value split into two 32-bit
    portions: the high portion identifies the object type (such as player, creature,
    item, etc.) and the low portion serves as a unique instance identifier. This method
    is commonly used when determining the category or class of an object within the
    game world, particularly for identifying what kind of entity a GUID represents
    without needing to parse the full 64-bit value.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a HighGuid value representing the high 32 bits of the ObjectGuid.
    This value encodes the object type and source information, allowing identification
    of the object's category (e.g., player, creature, game object) in the World of
    Warcraft server architecture.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve High Guid for a Player Object
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      HighGuid high = guid.GetHigh();

      // high now contains the high portion identifying this as a player GUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Object Type Using High Guid
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = player->GetGUID();\nif (guid.GetHigh() == HighGuid::Player)\n\
      {\n    // Handle player-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The HighGuid type is typically an enum or typedef that maps to specific object
    categories. The returned value from GetHigh() should be compared against predefined
    constants (like HighGuid::Player, HighGuid::Creature) for type checking. This
    method does not perform any validation or transformation of the GUID; it simply
    extracts the high bits.
