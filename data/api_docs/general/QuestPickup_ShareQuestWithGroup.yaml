api:
  class: QuestPickup
  method: ShareQuestWithGroup
  signature: void QuestPickup::ShareQuestWithGroup(Group * group, uint32 questId,
    Player * sender)
documentation:
  brief: Shares a quest with all members of a group, notifying them of the quest pickup.
  description: The ShareQuestWithGroup method broadcasts a quest pickup notification
    to all players within the specified group. This functionality is typically invoked
    when a player picks up a quest that should be shared with their group members.
    The method ensures that each group member receives the appropriate quest update,
    allowing them to track and potentially accept the quest if they haven't already.
    It's commonly used in group quest scenarios where multiple players are expected
    to participate in the same quest line.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members who will receive
      the quest notification. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being shared with the group. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is sharing the quest. This player's
      information is used to determine how the quest notification is sent and may
      affect quest tracking behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sharing with Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    QuestPickup::ShareQuestWithGroup(group,\
      \ 12345, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the communication with each group member's
    client to update their quest log. It does not validate whether the sender is actually
    in the group or if the quest is valid for sharing; such checks are expected to
    be performed before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null group will likely result in undefined behavior. Also,
    verify that the questId corresponds to an existing quest in the database to avoid
    client-side issues.
