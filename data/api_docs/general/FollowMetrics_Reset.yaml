  class: FollowMetrics
  method: Reset
  signature: void FollowMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all tracking metrics in the FollowMetrics class to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal tracking counters
    and data within the FollowMetrics class. This method is typically invoked when
    a new follow behavior needs to be started or when existing metrics should be cleared
    to prevent carryover between different follow sessions. The reset operation ensures
    that all metric values are set back to their default initial states, effectively
    starting fresh with no prior tracking data. This is commonly used in AI-driven
    NPC behavior systems where follow mechanics need to be reinitialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'FollowMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Clears all tracking data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Starting New Follow Session
    code: 'FollowMetrics metrics;

      // ... previous tracking data

      metrics.Reset();

      // Start new follow session with clean metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new follow behavior to ensure
    accurate tracking. The implementation likely involves setting internal counters
    and flags to zero or default values, but the exact internal structure is not specified
    in the API.
  warnings: Calling Reset() during an active follow session may result in loss of
    tracking data that was being collected. Ensure this method is only called when
    it's safe to discard existing metrics.
