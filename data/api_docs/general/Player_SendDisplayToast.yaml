documentation:
  brief: Displays a toast notification to the player with specified entry and type
  description: The SendDisplayToast method allows a player to receive a visual notification
    displaying an item or quest related to their character. This method is used to
    show various types of in-game notifications such as item acquisition, quest completion,
    or other game events. The toast display includes parameters for specifying the
    entry ID, type of toast, whether it's a bonus roll, quantity, method of display,
    and associated quest ID. It can be used to inform players about new items they've
    obtained or completed quests.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The identifier for the item or quest being displayed in the toast.
      This is typically an item entry ID or quest ID from the database.
  - name: type
    description: The type of display toast to show. Valid types include DisplayToastType::ITEM,
      DisplayToastType::QUEST, etc., which determines how the toast appears in-game.
  - name: isBonusRoll
    description: Indicates whether this is a bonus roll for item acquisition. If true,
      it shows an additional notification that the item was obtained through a bonus
      roll.
  - name: quantity
    description: The quantity of items being displayed in the toast. For example,
      if multiple items are obtained, this represents how many were acquired.
  - name: method
    description: The method used to display the toast. This can be DisplayToastMethod::INVENTORY,
      DisplayToastMethod::QUEST, etc., determining how the notification is presented
      to the player.
  - name: questId
    description: The quest ID associated with the toast. If the toast relates to a
      quest completion, this parameter specifies which quest was completed.
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to the item object being displayed in the toast. This is
      used when displaying item-related notifications and can be null if not applicable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendDisplayToast(12345, DisplayToastType::ITEM, true, 1, DisplayToastMethod::INVENTORY,
      0, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = Item::CreateItem(12345, player);

      player->SendDisplayToast(item->GetEntry(), DisplayToastType::ITEM, false, 1,
      DisplayToastMethod::INVENTORY, 67890, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    to provide visual feedback for game events. It should be called from within the
    context of a player's own session or when handling player actions. The method
    uses internal client-side logic to determine how and when to display the toast.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect display of notifications
    or missing information. Care must be taken to ensure that all parameters are properly
    set, especially when dealing with item entries and quest IDs. Using null pointers
    for item can lead to errors if not handled correctly.
