documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CreatureAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The CreatureAI destructor is automatically invoked when a creature's
    AI object is removed from memory. This method ensures proper cleanup of any dynamically
    allocated resources or internal data structures that the AI instance may be using.
    In the context of TrinityCore, this typically occurs when a creature is despawned,
    killed, or when the AI system is being shut down. The destructor does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct actions beyond resource deallocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during creature removal
    code: "void OnCreatureRemove(Creature* creature)\n{\n    // CreatureAI destructor\
      \ is automatically called here\n    // when the creature is removed from the\
      \ world\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when a CreatureAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually
    invoke this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
    The destruction process is handled transparently by the game engine.
