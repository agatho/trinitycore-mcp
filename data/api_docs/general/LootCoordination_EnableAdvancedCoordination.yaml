  class: LootCoordination
  method: EnableAdvancedCoordination
  signature: void LootCoordination::EnableAdvancedCoordination(uint32 groupId, bool
    enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables advanced loot coordination for a specified group.
  description: The EnableAdvancedCoordination method controls whether advanced loot
    coordination is active for a specific group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This functionality allows for more sophisticated loot distribution mechanisms,
    such as round-robin or need-before-greed systems, to be applied to group looting.
    The method takes a group identifier and a boolean flag to enable or disable the
    advanced coordination features. When enabled, this typically affects how loot
    is awarded to group members during group loot sessions, potentially changing the
    default behavior of the loot system for that particular group.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group for which advanced loot coordination
      should be enabled or disabled. This corresponds to a valid group ID within the
      TrinityCore instance.
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      advanced loot coordination for the specified group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Advanced Coordination for Group
    code: LootCoordination::EnableAdvancedCoordination(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Advanced Coordination for Group
    code: LootCoordination::EnableAdvancedCoordination(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot coordination systems and
    may require the group to be active or valid. It's important to ensure that group
    IDs are properly managed and that advanced coordination is only enabled for groups
    where such behavior is desired.
