  method: SendLfgOfferContinue
  signature: void WorldSession::SendLfgOfferContinue(uint32 dungeonEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG (Looking for Group) offer continue message to the client for
    a specified dungeon entry.
  description: The SendLfgOfferContinue method is used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to notify a player's client that they have been selected
    for a group finding opportunity. This method sends a specific packet to the connected
    client indicating that the player should continue with the LFG process, typically
    after being matched with other players for a dungeon or raid. The method takes
    a single parameter representing the dungeon entry ID which identifies the specific
    instance content the player is being offered. This functionality is part of the
    larger LFG system that helps players find groups for dungeons, raids, and other
    group content in the game.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonEntry
    description: The unique identifier for the dungeon or instance entry that the
      player is being offered. This value corresponds to the ID found in the game's
      database tables such as 'lfg_dungeons' and represents a specific dungeon, raid,
      or group content that players can join through the Looking for Group system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoinLfg(Player* player, uint32 dungeonId)\n{\n    WorldSession*\
      \ session = player->GetSession();\n    if (session)\n    {\n        session->SendLfgOfferContinue(dungeonId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG Queue System
    code: "void LfgManager::ProcessLfgMatch(Player* player, uint32 dungeonEntry)\n\
      {\n    // ... other matching logic ...\n    \n    WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\n\
      \    if (session && player->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        // Notify player that\
      \ they have been matched for a group\n        session->SendLfgOfferContinue(dungeonEntry);\n\
      \        \n        // ... continue with group creation logic ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG (Looking for Group) subsystem and requires
    that the player's session is valid and connected. The dungeonEntry parameter must
    correspond to a valid dungeon entry in the server's database. This method does
    not directly create or manage groups, but rather notifies clients about potential
    group opportunities. It should only be called when the player has been matched
    with other players for group content.
  warnings: This method should not be called without verifying that the player is
    actually eligible for the dungeon entry being offered. Calling this method with
    an invalid dungeonEntry ID may result in client-side errors or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that the WorldSession is valid and the player is still connected before
    calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
