api:
  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEmpoweredDreamBreath
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEmpoweredDreamBreath(int * target, EmpowermentLevel
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the empowered Dream Breath spell with the specified empowerment level
    on the target.
  description: The CastEmpoweredDreamBreath method is used by EvokerAI to execute
    the Dream Breath ability with enhanced effects based on the provided empowerment
    level. This method handles the logic for casting the spell, including targeting,
    spell validation, and applying the appropriate empowerment modifiers. The empowerment
    level determines the strength and effects of the spell, such as increased damage
    or additional healing. This function is typically invoked during the evoker's
    AI behavior when a suitable opportunity arises for using this ability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: level
    description: The empowerment level enum value that determines the spell's potency
      and effects. Valid values are typically defined in the EmpowermentLevel enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->CastEmpoweredDreamBreath(&targetGuid, EmpowermentLevel::First);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Targeting
    code: 'Unit* target = SelectBestTarget();

      int* targetPtr = reinterpret_cast<int*>(&target->GetGUID());

      EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->CastEmpoweredDreamBreath(targetPtr, EmpowermentLevel::Third);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and accessible within the current
    context. The AI must ensure proper targeting logic before calling this function.
    Performance-wise, this method may involve spell validation checks and potential
    cooldown management.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit; otherwise, casting
    will fail or cause undefined behavior. The empowerment level must be one of the
    defined values in EmpowermentLevel enum to avoid unexpected spell effects.
