  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: GetQuestHubsForPlayer
  signature: int QuestHubDatabase::GetQuestHubsForPlayer(const Player * player, uint32
    maxCount) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of quest hubs available to a player, up to a specified
    maximum count.
  description: The GetQuestHubsForPlayer method fetches all quest hubs that are relevant
    or accessible to the specified player character. It returns a count of how many
    quest hubs were successfully retrieved and populated into an internal data structure.
    This method is typically used in the context of dynamic quest systems where players
    can interact with various quest hubs located throughout Azeroth. The maximum number
    of quest hubs returned is capped by the maxCount parameter to prevent excessive
    memory allocation or performance degradation. It's important to note that this
    method may involve database queries and should be used judiciously in performance-sensitive
    code paths.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which quest hubs are being retrieved.
      Must not be null.
  - name: maxCount
    description: The maximum number of quest hubs to retrieve. Must be a positive
      integer; typically used to limit memory usage and processing time.
  returns: An integer representing the actual number of quest hubs retrieved for the
    player. Returns zero if no quest hubs are found or if an error occurs during retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 maxHubs =\
      \ 10;\nint hubCount = QuestHubDatabase::GetQuestHubsForPlayer(player, maxHubs);\n\
      if (hubCount > 0) {\n    // Process the retrieved quest hubs\n    printf(\"\
      Retrieved %d quest hubs for player\\n\", hubCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 maxHubs = 50;\nint result = QuestHubDatabase::GetQuestHubsForPlayer(player,\
      \ maxHubs);\nif (result < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to retrieve quest hubs for player\");\n} else if (result == 0) {\n  \
      \  // No quest hubs available\n    sLog->outInfo(\"No quest hubs found for player\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Successfully retrieved result\n    sLog->outInfo(\"Retrieved\
      \ %d quest hubs\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and may have performance implications
    if called frequently or with large maxCount values. It is recommended to cache
    results when possible, especially in high-frequency scenarios such as player login
    or zone transitions.
  warnings: Passing a very large value for maxCount can lead to excessive memory usage
    or slow performance. Always validate input parameters before calling this method.
    Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null to avoid undefined behavior.
