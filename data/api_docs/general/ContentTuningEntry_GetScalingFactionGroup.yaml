  class: ContentTuningEntry
  method: GetScalingFactionGroup
  signature: int32 ContentTuningEntry::GetScalingFactionGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the scaling faction group associated with the content tuning entry.
  description: The GetScalingFactionGroup method returns an integer value representing
    the faction group used for scaling calculations within the content tuning system.
    This value determines how difficulty scaling is applied to creatures, loot, and
    other game elements based on player faction alignment. The returned value typically
    corresponds to predefined faction group identifiers defined in the game's data
    files. This method is commonly used during dynamic content generation and difficulty
    adjustment processes in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the scaling faction group ID. This identifier
    maps to a specific faction group in the game's database that controls how content
    scales for different player factions. Returns 0 if no scaling faction group is
    defined for this content tuning entry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ContentTuningEntry* entry = sContentTuningStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    int32 scalingGroup = entry->GetScalingFactionGroup();\n  \
      \  printf(\"Scaling faction group: %d\\n\", scalingGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are typically populated
    during server startup from the game's database. The returned faction group ID
    should be validated against known faction group definitions to ensure proper scaling
    behavior. This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable data.
  warnings: Be aware that a return value of 0 may indicate either no scaling faction
    group is defined or an invalid entry lookup. Always validate the content tuning
    entry exists before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
