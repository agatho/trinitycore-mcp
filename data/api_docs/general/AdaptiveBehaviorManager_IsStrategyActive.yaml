  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: IsStrategyActive
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::IsStrategyActive(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific adaptive behavior strategy is currently active.
  description: The IsStrategyActive method determines if a particular adaptive behavior
    strategy, identified by a unique flag, is currently enabled and active within
    the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This method is typically used in AI systems to evaluate
    the state of various behavioral strategies that govern NPC or player actions.
    The flag parameter corresponds to a predefined set of strategy identifiers that
    define different adaptive behaviors such as combat tactics, movement patterns,
    or interaction logic. The method returns true if the specified strategy is active,
    and false otherwise. This functionality allows for dynamic behavior modification
    based on game conditions, player actions, or environmental factors.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A unique identifier representing a specific adaptive behavior strategy.
      This flag should correspond to predefined constants or enums that define different
      AI behaviors within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified adaptive behavior strategy is currently active,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a combat strategy is active
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.IsStrategyActive(ADAPTIVE_STRATEGY_COMBAT))\
      \ {\n    // Perform combat-related actions\n    DoCombatBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional behavior based on strategy state
    code: "uint32 strategyFlags[] = { ADAPTIVE_STRATEGY_FLEE, ADAPTIVE_STRATEGY_ATTACK,\
      \ ADAPTIVE_STRATEGY_FOLLOW };\nfor (uint32 flag : strategyFlags) {\n    if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.IsStrategyActive(flag))\
      \ {\n        // Execute behavior associated with active strategy\n        ExecuteStrategyBehavior(flag);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    methods to manage and query the state of AI behaviors. The implementation likely
    involves internal tracking of active strategies using bitmasks or similar data
    structures for efficient lookup. Performance is generally good as it's a simple
    lookup operation, but frequent calls should be monitored in performance-critical
    sections.
  warnings: Ensure that the flag parameter corresponds to valid strategy identifiers
    defined within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager system. Using an invalid or undefined
    flag may result in unpredictable behavior or incorrect return values. This method
    should not be used to modify strategy states directly; it only provides read access
    to current active status.
