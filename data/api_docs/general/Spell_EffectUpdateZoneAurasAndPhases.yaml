  brief: Updates zone-based auras and phases for the spell's target
  description: The EffectUpdateZoneAurasAndPhases method is responsible for synchronizing
    and updating aura states and phase information for the spell's target within the
    current zone. This method ensures that any zone-specific effects, such as area-of-effect
    auras or phased environment changes, are properly applied or removed based on
    the target's current location and the spell's zone-related properties. It typically
    gets invoked during spell effect application or update cycles to maintain consistency
    between the game world state and the spell's intended behavior in different zones.

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Handling
    code: "void MySpell::HandleEffectUpdateZoneAurasAndPhases(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n\
      {\n    // Perform spell effect logic\n    // ...\n    \n    // Update zone auras\
      \ and phases for the target\n    EffectUpdateZoneAurasAndPhases();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the zone manager and aura system to ensure
    proper state synchronization. It may be called automatically by the core during
    spell effect processing, but can also be explicitly invoked when custom zone-based
    logic is required.
