  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: UpdateManagers
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::UpdateManagers(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all combat behavior managers with the specified time difference.
  description: The UpdateManagers method is responsible for processing and updating
    the state of all active combat behavior managers within the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    system. It takes a time delta (diff) parameter representing milliseconds elapsed
    since the last update, and uses this to advance the internal timers and states
    of each manager. This method is typically called from the main game loop or AI
    update cycle to ensure that combat behaviors are properly timed and responsive.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the managers
    it controls.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    combatBehaviorIntegration.UpdateManagers(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game's main update loop to
    maintain proper behavior timing. It is designed to be non-blocking and efficient,
    as it's typically invoked hundreds of times per second during active combat scenarios.
