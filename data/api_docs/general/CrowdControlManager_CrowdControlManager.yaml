  class: CrowdControlManager
  method: CrowdControlManager
  signature: void CrowdControlManager::CrowdControlManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CrowdControlManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The CrowdControlManager constructor initializes a new instance of the
    CrowdControlManager class, associating it with a specific player bot. This manager
    is responsible for handling crowd control mechanics and behaviors within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly for AI-controlled characters. The constructor sets up
    internal data structures and references needed to manage crowd control effects,
    such as stuns, roots, and other movement-altering abilities. It ensures that the
    manager is properly linked to the player's context and can respond to various
    game events related to crowd control.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this CrowdControlManager
      will manage. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will cause undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      CrowdControlManager ccManager(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public PlayerbotAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize() override\
      \ {\n        // Initialize the crowd control manager for this bot\n        ccManager\
      \ = new CrowdControlManager(bot);\n    }\nprivate:\n    CrowdControlManager*\
      \ ccManager;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation on the input player pointer.
    It is assumed that the caller has already validated that the Player object is
    valid and properly initialized. The manager will maintain a reference to the player
    throughout its lifetime, so ensure the player remains valid during the manager's
    usage.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the bot parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    Always validate that the Player pointer is non-null before calling this constructor.
    Additionally, be cautious about creating multiple CrowdControlManager instances
    for the same player, as this may lead to resource conflicts or unexpected behavior.
