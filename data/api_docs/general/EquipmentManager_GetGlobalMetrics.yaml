  class: EquipmentManager
  method: GetGlobalMetrics
  signature: const EquipmentMetrics & EquipmentManager::GetGlobalMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the global equipment metrics object managed
    by the EquipmentManager.
  description: The GetGlobalMetrics method provides access to a shared, read-only
    collection of equipment-related performance and statistical data. This metrics
    object typically contains aggregated information about item usage, enchantments,
    gemming patterns, and other equipment-related statistics across all players or
    a specific subset within the game world. The returned reference is guaranteed
    to be valid for the lifetime of the EquipmentManager instance and should not be
    modified directly. This method is commonly used by subsystems that require aggregate
    equipment data for analysis, balancing, or reporting purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an EquipmentMetrics object containing global equipment
    statistics and performance data. The reference remains valid throughout the lifetime
    of the EquipmentManager instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Equipment Metrics
    code: 'const EquipmentMetrics& metrics = equipmentManager.GetGlobalMetrics();

      uint32 totalEnchantedItems = metrics.GetTotalEnchantedItems();

      float averageItemLevel = metrics.GetAverageItemLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned EquipmentMetrics object is typically populated asynchronously
    during server maintenance or periodic updates. Modifications to the global metrics
    should be done through dedicated setter methods rather than direct access. This
    method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread that has access to the
    EquipmentManager instance.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned EquipmentMetrics reference directly as it represents
    shared global state. Any modifications should be performed through appropriate
    manager methods to maintain data consistency across all subsystems.
