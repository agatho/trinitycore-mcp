  brief: Returns the name of the arena team
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name assigned to an
    arena team. This name is used for identification purposes within the game's UI
    and communication systems. The returned string is a constant reference, meaning
    it should not be modified directly. Arena teams in TrinityCore are created with
    unique names to distinguish them from other teams, and this method provides access
    to that identifying information. The method does not perform any validation or
    transformation on the name; it simply returns the stored value as it was originally
    set when the team was created.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the arena team's name.
    The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized arena
    teams.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    const std::string& teamName = team->GetName();\n    printf(\"Arena Team\
      \ Name: %s\\n\", teamName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Player Communication
    code: "void SendArenaTeamInfo(Player* player, uint32 arenaTeamId)\n{\n    ArenaTeam*\
      \ team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(arenaTeamId);\n    if (team)\n    {\n\
      \        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Arena Team: %s\"\
      , team->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference remains valid for the lifetime of the ArenaTeam
    object. This method is thread-safe as long as the ArenaTeam object itself is not
    being modified concurrently. The name string is stored in a way that supports
    Unicode characters, allowing international team names to be properly displayed.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string reference as it points to internal data.
    If you need to modify the name, use the appropriate setter method instead. Be
    aware that accessing GetName() on a null or invalid ArenaTeam pointer will result
    in undefined behavior.
