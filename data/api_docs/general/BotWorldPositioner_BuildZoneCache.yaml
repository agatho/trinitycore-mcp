  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: BuildZoneCache
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::BuildZoneCache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal zone cache with data from the game world for bot positioning
    calculations.
  description: The BuildZoneCache method initializes and fills an internal cache structure
    with zone-related information from the TrinityCore game world. This cache is essential
    for efficient bot positioning and navigation logic, as it avoids repeated database
    queries or expensive runtime calculations when determining which zones bots are
    located in or need to navigate to. The method typically runs during initialization
    or when zone data changes, ensuring that all subsequent bot movement decisions
    are based on up-to-date zone information. It may also handle edge cases such as
    overlapping zones or zones with special properties like instances or battlegrounds.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.BuildZoneCache();

      // Zone cache is now populated for use in bot positioning logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any bot positioning operations that rely
    on zone data. It's typically invoked during server startup or when new zone data
    becomes available. The internal cache structure may be updated periodically to
    reflect changes in the game world.
