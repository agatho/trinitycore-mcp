  signature: uint64 Spell::handle_delayed(uint64 t_offset)
documentation:
  brief: Handles delayed spell execution by adjusting the spell's cast time offset.
  description: The handle_delayed method adjusts the timing of a spell's execution
    by modifying the cast time offset, allowing for delayed or extended spell casting.
    This method is typically used in scenarios where spell delays are required due
    to game mechanics such as movement restrictions, interruptible spells, or specific
    gameplay events. It modifies the spell's internal timing mechanism to ensure proper
    execution after a delay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the updated cast time offset value which represents the new delay
    duration in milliseconds for the spell execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint64 delay = spell->handle_delayed(1000); // Delay spell by 1 second
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with spell handling logic to
    manage timing of spells during combat or movement. The method may affect the spell's
    execution timeline and should be used carefully to avoid disrupting game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell timing, potentially
    causing gameplay issues such as delayed or missed spell executions. Ensure that
    delay values are properly calculated based on game mechanics.
