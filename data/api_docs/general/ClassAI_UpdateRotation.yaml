  class: ClassAI
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void ClassAI::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI rotation state based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for managing the artificial
    intelligence behavior of a creature or NPC by updating its rotation state in response
    to a target. This method typically handles the logic for how an AI-controlled
    unit or mob rotates its orientation to face its target, which is crucial for combat
    mechanics and visual presentation. It may also include handling of movement, attack
    timing, or other AI-related behaviors that depend on the current target. The method
    operates on internal AI state and does not directly interact with external systems
    beyond updating the rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the ID of the current target entity.
      This value is used internally by the AI system to determine how to rotate or
      orient the unit towards its target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ExampleCreature::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target =\
      \ SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        m_ai->UpdateRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop of a creature.
    It's important to ensure that the target pointer passed in is valid and not null,
    as invalid targets can cause undefined behavior or crashes. The internal rotation
    logic may involve pathfinding or movement calculations depending on the specific
    implementation.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null target pointer could lead to segmentation faults
    or incorrect AI behavior. Always verify that the target exists before calling
    this method.
