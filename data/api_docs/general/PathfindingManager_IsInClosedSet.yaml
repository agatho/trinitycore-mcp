  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsInClosedSet
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsInClosedSet(const int & pos, const int & closedSet)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is present in the closed set during pathfinding
    operations.
  description: The IsInClosedSet method determines whether a specific position has
    already been evaluated and processed during pathfinding calculations. This method
    is typically used within A* pathfinding algorithms to avoid reprocessing nodes
    that have already been considered. The closed set contains all positions that
    have been fully evaluated, ensuring efficient traversal by preventing redundant
    computations. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method supports
    NPC movement and AI navigation systems where performance and correctness of path
    calculations are critical.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate to check against the closed set. This represents
      a node in the pathfinding grid or graph.
  - name: closedSet
    description: Reference to the collection or data structure storing previously
      evaluated positions. This is typically an ordered set or hash table containing
      visited nodes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position exists in the closed set, indicating
    that it has already been processed and should not be revisited during pathfinding.
    Returns false if the position is not found in the closed set, meaning it can still
    be considered for evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a node is processed
    code: "int currentNode = 1234;\nint closedSet[1000]; // Assume this is populated\n\
      if (pathfinder.IsInClosedSet(currentNode, closedSet)) {\n    // Skip processing\
      \ this node\n    continue;\n}\n// Proceed with pathfinding logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    It is designed for use within a pathfinding context where performance matters,
    so the underlying data structure of closedSet should support fast lookup operations
    such as hash tables or binary search trees.
  warnings: Ensure that the closedSet parameter is correctly maintained throughout
    the pathfinding process to avoid incorrect behavior. Incorrectly updating or clearing
    the closed set may lead to infinite loops or suboptimal paths.
