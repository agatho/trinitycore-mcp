  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: Update
  signature: void IBotSessionManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active bot sessions with the specified time delta.
  description: The Update method processes and advances the state of all currently
    managed bot sessions by the provided time interval. This method is typically called
    from the main game loop to ensure that bot behaviors, AI logic, and session states
    are properly maintained and synchronized with the passage of real-time. It handles
    internal updates such as movement calculations, behavior decision making, and
    any time-based events for each active bot. The diff parameter represents the time
    elapsed since the last update in milliseconds, which is crucial for maintaining
    consistent timing across different system performance conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      determines how much time has passed and influences the rate at which bot behaviors
      progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->getWorldTickTime();\n   \
      \ sBotSessionManager->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Server Tick
    code: "class World;\nclass BotSessionManager : public IBotSessionManager\n{\n\
      public:\n    void Update(uint32 diff) override\n    {\n        // Process all\
      \ bot sessions with the time delta\n        for (auto& session : m_sessions)\n\
      \        {\n            if (session->IsActive())\n                session->Update(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game thread to ensure
    proper bot behavior synchronization. The diff value should accurately reflect
    the time elapsed since the last call to maintain consistent AI timing across different
    server loads.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero diff values may cause erratic
    bot behavior or freezing of AI logic. Ensure that the time delta is always a positive
    integer representing actual elapsed milliseconds.
