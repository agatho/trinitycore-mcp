documentation:
  brief: Cancels a conversation effect within the spell system
  description: This method removes the conversation effect from a spell, effectively
    stopping any ongoing conversation associated with the spell. It is typically used
    when a spell's conversation needs to be terminated before its natural completion.
    The method operates on the spell's internal conversation state and ensures proper
    cleanup of related resources. This functionality is particularly relevant in scenarios
    where spell effects need to be dynamically modified or canceled during execution.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectCancelConversation();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should only be called when the spell is in a state where conversation
    effects are active. Calling this method outside of such contexts may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause memory leaks or incorrect spell
    state handling. Ensure that the spell's conversation state is properly managed
    before calling this method.
