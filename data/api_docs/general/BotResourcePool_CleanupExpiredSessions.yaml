documentation:
  brief: Removes expired bot resource sessions from the pool
  description: The CleanupExpiredSessions method iterates through all active bot resource
    sessions and removes those that have exceeded their defined expiration time. This
    method is typically called periodically by the system to maintain clean resource
    management and prevent memory leaks from stale bot sessions. It ensures that only
    currently valid sessions remain in the resource pool, freeing up system resources
    for new bot operations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotResourcePool resourcePool;

      resourcePool.CleanupExpiredSessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the system's maintenance
    routine to prevent accumulation of stale sessions. The cleanup process is typically
    non-blocking and operates on a snapshot of active sessions to avoid concurrency
    issues.
