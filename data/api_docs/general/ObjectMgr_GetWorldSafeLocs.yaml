  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetWorldSafeLocs
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GetWorldSafeLocs() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of world safe locations stored in the ObjectMgr.
  description: The GetWorldSafeLocs method returns an integer representing the total
    count of world safe locations that have been loaded and registered within the
    ObjectMgr. These safe locations are typically used by the game to define areas
    where players can safely respawn or teleport without risk of combat or hostile
    encounters. This method is commonly invoked during server initialization or when
    checking the integrity of safe location data. The returned value indicates how
    many such locations are available for use in the game world, and it's often used
    internally by TrinityCore's core systems to validate configuration or perform
    operations related to player movement and respawning.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of world safe locations currently
    loaded in the ObjectMgr. Returns 0 if no safe locations are defined or loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Check Safe Locations Count
    code: "int safeLocCount = sObjectMgr->GetWorldSafeLocs();\nif (safeLocCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Loaded %d world safe locations.\", safeLocCount);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARNING(\"server\", \"No world safe locations found!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database loading
    phases. It's a read-only operation that does not modify any internal state. The
    actual location data is usually stored in a container within ObjectMgr, and this
    method simply returns the size of that container.
