  brief: Initializes the herbalism material data for the profession auction bridge
    system
  description: The InitializeHerbalismMaterials method prepares and loads all necessary
    herbalism-related materials and their associated data into the profession auction
    bridge system. This includes gathering information about herbs, their qualities,
    vendors, and auction house listings that are relevant to the herbalism profession.
    The method ensures that all herbalism items are properly registered within the
    auction system so they can be bought, sold, and tracked through the auction interface.
    It typically runs during server initialization or when loading profession-specific
    data.

  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization to avoid
    duplicate data loading. It may involve database queries and caching operations
    that could impact startup time.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure all existing herbalism data is cleared
    before reinitialization.
