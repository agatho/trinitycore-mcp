documentation:
  brief: Sends a trade-related notification message to both participants in a trading
    session
  description: The NotifyTradeParticipants method is responsible for broadcasting
    a specified message to both players involved in a trade session. This function
    ensures that both parties receive consistent communication about the state or
    status of their trade transaction. The method likely handles the underlying network
    messaging required to update clients and may be used for informing players of
    trade confirmations, cancellations, or other relevant trade events. It operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's trade system and is typically invoked during
    trade session management operations.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Reference to the TradeSession object representing the active trading
      session between two players
  - name: message
    description: String containing the notification message to be sent to both trade
      participants
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Notify players of successful trade completion
    code: 'TradeSession session = GetActiveTradeSession(player1, player2);

      std::string msg = "Trade completed successfully!";

      TradeSystem::NotifyTradeParticipants(session, msg);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send trade cancellation notification
    code: 'TradeSession session = GetActiveTradeSession(player1, player2);

      std::string msg = "Trade has been cancelled by one of the parties.";

      TradeSystem::NotifyTradeParticipants(session, msg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal messaging systems to ensure both players
    receive the notification in a timely manner. It may perform checks to verify that
    both players are still connected and in the same zone before sending messages.
    The implementation might also handle localization or formatting of the message
    for client display.
  warnings: Ensure that the TradeSession object passed is valid and represents an
    active trade, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Avoid sending large messages
    as they could impact performance or exceed client message limits.
