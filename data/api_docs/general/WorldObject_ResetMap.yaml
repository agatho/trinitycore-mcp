  brief: Resets the WorldObject's map to its default state
  description: The ResetMap method resets a WorldObject's map to its default state,
    clearing any temporary data or settings that may have been applied during gameplay.
    This method is typically used when an object needs to be returned to its original
    state after being modified or when a new map instance is required. It ensures
    that the object's map-related properties are properly reset without affecting
    other game mechanics or object states.

    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      obj->ResetMap();

      // Object''s map is now reset to default state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during gameplay to avoid unintended
    side effects. It may be called automatically during certain game events or when
    objects are removed from the world.
