  class: LanguageMgr
  method: GetLanguageDescById
  signature: int LanguageMgr::GetLanguageDescById(int languageId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the language description identifier for a given language ID.
  description: The GetLanguageDescById method is used to fetch the corresponding language
    description identifier associated with a specific language ID within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically employed in game systems that handle multilingual
    support, localization, or language-specific content delivery. It allows developers
    to map internal language identifiers to their respective descriptive values for
    use in UI elements, chat systems, or localization logic. The method does not perform
    any validation on the input language ID and assumes a valid identifier is provided.
    If an invalid or unrecognized language ID is passed, the behavior may result in
    undefined or unexpected outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the language description identifier associated
    with the specified language ID. A return value of -1 or 0 may indicate an invalid
    or unrecognized language ID, depending on implementation details. The exact meaning
    of returned values should be verified against internal language tables or documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve language description
    code: "int langDescId = sLanguageMgr->GetLanguageDescById(1); // Retrieves description\
      \ ID for language ID 1\nif (langDescId > 0)\n{\n    // Use the language description\
      \ ID for further processing\n    printf(\"Language description ID: %d\\n\",\
      \ langDescId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LanguageMgr class and likely relies on internal
    data structures or lookup tables to map language IDs to their descriptions. Developers
    should ensure that language IDs passed to this function are valid and within expected
    ranges to avoid potential errors or incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or out-of-range language ID may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. It is recommended to validate input values before calling
    this method in production code.
