  method: HasSrc
  signature: bool SpellCastTargets::HasSrc() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell cast targets contain a source location.
  description: The HasSrc method checks if the SpellCastTargets object has a defined
    source location. This is typically used in spell casting logic to verify that
    a spell's starting point (source) has been set before proceeding with spell execution
    or validation. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, spell targets
    consist of various components including source, target, and object targets. The
    presence of a source location is crucial for proper spell mechanics and can affect
    how spells are processed, visualized, and validated within the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SpellCastTargets object contains a valid source location;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the spell casting operation has
    a defined starting point for the spell's trajectory or effect origin.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for source location
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set up targets ...\nif (targets.HasSrc())\
      \ {\n    // Source location is available, proceed with spell logic\n    // ...\
      \ spell execution code ...\n} else {\n    // No source location, handle appropriately\n\
      \    // ... error handling or fallback logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell casting validation
    code: "Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, TRIGGERED_NONE);\nSpellCastTargets\
      \ targets;\n// ... populate targets with source and target data ...\nif (!targets.HasSrc())\
      \ {\n    // Log error or abort spell cast\n    sLog->outError(\"Spell %u failed:\
      \ Missing source location\", spellInfo->Id);\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed\
      \ with normal spell casting flow"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used during spell validation phases to ensure that
    all required target components are properly initialized. The source location may
    be set through various means including direct coordinate assignment, unit reference,
    or object reference depending on the spell's requirements. Performance-wise, this
    is a simple boolean check and should not impact execution speed significantly.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that HasSrc() only checks for the existence
    of a source location, not its validity or appropriateness. A true return value
    does not guarantee that the source coordinates are within valid bounds or that
    they conform to spell-specific constraints. Additionally, in some contexts, spells
    may function without explicit source locations (e.g., area-of-effect spells),
    so this check should be used appropriately based on spell type and mechanics.
