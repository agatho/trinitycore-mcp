  method: IsStaticSpawn
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::IsStaticSpawn() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger is a static spawn.
  description: The IsStaticSpawn method checks if the area trigger was created as
    a static spawn, meaning it was defined in the database with a fixed position and
    does not dynamically spawn based on game events or conditions. Static spawns are
    typically used for permanent area triggers such as quest objectives or environmental
    effects that remain active throughout the game session. This method is useful
    for distinguishing between persistent and dynamic area triggers during gameplay
    logic implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger is a static spawn, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area Trigger is Static Spawn
    code: "if (areaTrigger->IsStaticSpawn()) {\n    // Handle static area trigger\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Area trigger %u is a static spawn.\", areaTrigger->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle dynamic area trigger logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Area\
      \ trigger %u is dynamically spawned.\", areaTrigger->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags set during the area trigger's creation
    process. The distinction between static and dynamic spawns affects how the trigger
    is managed in memory and whether it persists across zone reloads or server restarts.
