  class: PowerWordShieldTracker
  method: ApplyShield
  signature: void PowerWordShieldTracker::ApplyShield(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: 'Applies a Power Word: Shield effect to the specified target with the given
    duration.'
  description: 'The ApplyShield method is responsible for applying the Power Word:
    Shield spell effect to a target unit identified by its GUID. This method manages
    the shield''s duration and ensures proper application within the TrinityCore framework.
    The shield will absorb damage up to its maximum value until the duration expires
    or the shield is consumed through damage absorption. This method typically integrates
    with the spell system and aura management components of the core.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: 'The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will receive
      the Power Word: Shield effect. This must be a valid GameObject, Creature, or
      Player GUID.'
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the shield will remain active.
      This value determines how long the shield will absorb damage before expiring.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shield Application
    code: 'PowerWordShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyShield(12345, 10000); // Apply shield to target with GUID 12345
      for 10 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Shield Duration
    code: 'PowerWordShieldTracker tracker;

      uint32 duration = 5000 + (player->GetLevel() * 100); // Variable duration based
      on player level

      tracker.ApplyShield(targetGuid, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the aura system to properly register and
    manage the shield effect. The shield's maximum value is typically determined by
    the caster's spell power or other relevant attributes. Ensure that the target
    GUID is valid before calling this method to prevent runtime errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes within the TrinityCore engine. Always validate the target exists and
    is accessible before applying the shield effect.
