  method: IsPerformanceHealthy
  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsPerformanceHealthy() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot's current performance is within acceptable thresholds
    for optimal gameplay.
  description: The IsPerformanceHealthy method evaluates the overall performance metrics
    of a bot instance to determine if it is operating within defined healthy parameters.
    This method typically checks various system resources such as CPU usage, memory
    consumption, and frame rate stability. It is used by the TrinityCore AI system
    to make decisions about bot behavior, such as whether to reduce complexity or
    switch to a more conservative gameplay strategy when performance degrades. The
    method returns true if all monitored metrics are within acceptable ranges, indicating
    that the bot can operate at full capacity without risking system instability or
    degraded player experience.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all performance metrics are within healthy thresholds,
    indicating optimal bot operation; returns false if any metric exceeds defined
    limits, suggesting potential performance issues requiring mitigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Check
    code: "if (bot->GetPerformanceMonitor()->IsPerformanceHealthy()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal bot behavior\n    bot->ExecuteNormalAI();\n} else {\n    // Reduce\
      \ bot complexity or pause certain activities\n    bot->SimplifyBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the bot's main update loop
    to monitor performance health. The specific thresholds for what constitutes 'healthy'
    performance may vary based on server configuration and bot type. The implementation
    likely uses cached performance data rather than real-time measurements to avoid
    overhead.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical gameplay decisions without
    considering other factors such as network latency or player interaction patterns.
    The method may return false during brief spikes in resource usage that are not
    indicative of sustained poor performance.
