documentation:
  brief: Removes expired data entries from the AI's internal tracking structures.
  description: The CleanupExpiredData method is responsible for removing outdated
    or expired entries from the ThreadSafeClassAI's internal data structures. This
    typically involves iterating through tracked objects, such as units, items, or
    events, and purging those that have exceeded their valid lifetime or have been
    marked as expired. The method ensures that the AI system maintains clean state
    by preventing accumulation of stale data that could impact performance or cause
    logical errors. It is designed to be thread-safe and is usually invoked periodically
    or upon specific triggers within the game loop.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    threadSafeAI.CleanupExpiredData();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the AI update cycle or during
    periodic cleanup tasks. It's important to note that this method should not be
    called concurrently with other methods modifying the same data structures without
    proper synchronization, although it's designed to be thread-safe internally.
