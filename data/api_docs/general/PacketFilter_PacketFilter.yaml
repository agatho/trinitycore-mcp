documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PacketFilter object by copying the state from another PacketFilter
    instance.
  description: The PacketFilter constructor initializes a new PacketFilter object
    by performing a deep copy of all member variables from the provided right-hand
    PacketFilter object. This method ensures that the newly created object has identical
    filtering rules, configuration settings, and internal state as the source object.
    In the context of TrinityCore's network handling system, this constructor is typically
    used when creating copies of packet filters for different connection contexts
    or when implementing filter cloning functionality. The operation performs a shallow
    copy of all data members, ensuring that both objects remain independent after
    initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PacketFilter Copy Construction
    code: 'PacketFilter originalFilter;

      // Configure originalFilter with specific filtering rules

      PacketFilter newFilter(originalFilter); // Creates a copy of originalFilter'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PacketFilter in Network Handler Context
    code: "class NetworkHandler {\npublic:\n    void ProcessIncomingPacket(PacketFilter&\
      \ filter) {\n        PacketFilter clonedFilter(filter); // Clone the filter\
      \ for processing\n        // Use clonedFilter to process packet\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a member-wise copy of all data members. Developers
    should be aware that if the PacketFilter class contains pointers or complex objects,
    a deep copy implementation might be required for proper behavior. The method is
    typically used in scenarios where packet filtering rules need to be duplicated
    across multiple connections or contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that any dynamically allocated memory within PacketFilter is properly
    managed during copying. If the class contains raw pointers or references, this
    constructor may lead to shallow copy issues unless explicitly implemented otherwise.
