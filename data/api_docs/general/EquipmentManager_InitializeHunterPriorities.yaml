documentation:
  brief: Initializes the priority order for hunter equipment slots.
  description: The InitializeHunterPriorities method sets up the default priority
    sequence for equipment slots specific to hunter characters. This method is typically
    invoked during character initialization or when switching classes to ensure that
    the hunter's equipment management system uses the correct slot prioritization
    logic. It configures internal data structures that determine which equipment slots
    are considered more important for item assignment and replacement decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EquipmentManager* mgr = player->GetEquipmentManager();

      mgr->InitializeHunterPriorities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per character during initialization
    or class switching. It modifies internal state and may affect how equipment is
    automatically equipped or replaced by the game's AI system.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    undefined behavior in the equipment management system. Ensure that it's only invoked
    when necessary, such as after a class change or at character creation.
