  signature: int ObjectMgr::CheckPlayerName(std::string_view name, LocaleConstant
    locale, bool create)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a player name against game rules and returns an error code indicating
    success or failure.
  description: The CheckPlayerName method verifies whether a given player name adheres
    to the game's naming rules for the specified locale. It checks for invalid characters,
    length restrictions, and reserved words. The method is typically used during character
    creation or name changes to ensure compliance with World of Warcraft's naming
    policies. When the 'create' parameter is true, it also validates that the name
    is not already in use by another player. This method helps maintain game integrity
    by preventing inappropriate or conflicting names.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The player name to validate as a std::string_view. Must be between
      2 and 12 characters long, containing only valid alphanumeric characters and
      spaces.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant representing the game locale for which the name
      validation should be performed. Determines language-specific rules and character
      sets.
  - name: create
    description: Boolean flag indicating if this is a character creation check (true)
      or a general validation (false). When true, checks if name is already taken.
  returns: 'Returns an integer code indicating the result of the name validation:

    - 0: Name is valid and available

    - 1: Name is invalid due to length or character restrictions

    - 2: Name contains forbidden words or phrases

    - 3: Name is already taken (when create=true)

    - 4: Name is too short or too long for the specified locale

    - 5: Name contains invalid characters not allowed in the given locale'
  examples:
  - title: Basic name validation
    code: "int result = sObjectMgr->CheckPlayerName(\"ShadowHunter\", LOCALE_en, false);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Name is valid\n    printf(\"Name is acceptable\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid name\n    printf(\"Invalid name: %d\\\
      n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Character creation validation
    code: "std::string playerName = \"NewPlayer123\";\nint result = sObjectMgr->CheckPlayerName(playerName,\
      \ LOCALE_en, true);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Proceed with character creation\n\
      \    printf(\"Creating character with name: %s\\n\", playerName.c_str());\n\
      } else if (result == 3) {\n    // Name already taken\n    printf(\"Error: Name\
      \ is already in use\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Other validation errors\n    printf(\"\
      Name validation failed with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs case-insensitive checks and may cache results for performance.
    It's thread-safe when used with proper locking mechanisms. The method respects
    locale-specific rules, so names valid in one language might be invalid in another.
    For optimal performance, avoid calling this method repeatedly without need.
  warnings: Do not use this method to validate names from untrusted sources without
    proper sanitization. The method assumes the name is already pre-sanitized for
    basic characters but does not protect against all forms of injection or malicious
    input. Always check return values before proceeding with character creation or
    name changes.
