documentation:
  brief: Loads a specific map tile for the given map ID and coordinates
  description: The loadMap method is responsible for loading a specific map tile from
    the VMap (Virtual Map) system in TrinityCore. It takes a base path, map ID, and
    grid coordinates (x, y) to determine which map tile should be loaded into memory.
    This method is typically used during player movement or zone loading to ensure
    that the appropriate terrain and object data for a specific location is available.
    The method returns a LoadResult enum indicating whether the operation succeeded,
    failed, or if the tile was already loaded. It's an essential part of the dynamic
    map loading system that allows for efficient memory usage by only loading necessary
    map data.
  parameters:
  - name: pBasePath
    description: The base file path where VMap data files are stored. This typically
      points to the directory containing .vmap files used for collision detection
      and terrain data.
  - name: pMapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map to load. This corresponds to the
      Map ID used internally by TrinityCore to identify different zones or instances.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid tile to load. Grid coordinates are typically
      in the range 0-63 for standard map tiles.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid tile to load. Grid coordinates are typically
      in the range 0-63 for standard map tiles.
  returns: Returns a LoadResult enum value indicating the outcome of the loading operation.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, ALREADY_LOADED, or other status codes
    depending on the implementation. The result helps determine if the map tile was
    successfully loaded, if it was already present in memory, or if there was an error
    during the process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Tile Loading
    code: "IVMapManager* vmapManager = sVMapMgr;\nLoadResult result = vmapManager->loadMap(\"\
      ./vmaps\", 0, 10, 15);\nif (result == LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS) {\n    // Map tile\
      \ loaded successfully\n    printf(\"Map tile loaded successfully\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle loading failure\n    printf(\"Failed to load map tile\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Multiple Tiles in a Loop
    code: "IVMapManager* vmapManager = sVMapMgr;\nfor (int x = 0; x < 64; ++x) {\n\
      \    for (int y = 0; y < 64; ++y) {\n        LoadResult result = vmapManager->loadMap(\"\
      ./vmaps\", 0, x, y);\n        if (result == LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS || result ==\
      \ LOAD_RESULT_ALREADY_LOADED) {\n            // Continue with successful or\
      \ already loaded tiles\n            continue;\n        } else {\n          \
      \  // Log error for failed tile loading\n            printf(\"Failed to load\
      \ tile at (%d,%d)\\n\", x, y);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core during player movement
    or zone transitions. It's important to note that loading map tiles can be a performance-intensive
    operation, especially when loading large numbers of tiles simultaneously. The
    method may block until the tile data is fully loaded from disk, so it should be
    used judiciously in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid coordinates or non-existent map IDs can
    result in errors or undefined behavior. Always validate inputs before calling
    this method. Additionally, because this method may block during file I/O operations,
    it should not be called from time-sensitive threads such as those handling network
    requests or game loop updates.
