  signature: bool ZonePlacement::IsValidForFaction(int factionTeam) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the zone placement is valid for the specified faction
    team.
  description: The IsValidForFaction method checks if a given zone placement is appropriate
    for a specific faction team. This validation typically ensures that players from
    a particular faction (Alliance or Horde) can properly enter and interact within
    the defined zone boundaries. The method likely evaluates internal flags or configuration
    settings related to faction restrictions, zone access rules, or player team affiliations.
    It is commonly used during zone loading, player movement validation, or when determining
    whether a player can access certain zone-specific content based on their faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the zone placement is valid for the specified faction team;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    zone either does not support the faction or has restrictions preventing that faction
    from accessing it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (zonePlacement.IsValidForFaction(FACTION_TEAM_ALLIANCE)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ Alliance players to enter this zone\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Welcome to the Alliance zone!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Faction-Specific Zone Access
    code: "uint32 playerFaction = player->GetTeam();\nif (!zonePlacement.IsValidForFaction(playerFaction))\
      \ {\n    player->TeleportTo(0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // Teleport back to\
      \ starting location\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot enter this zone\
      \ with your current faction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may rely on internal zone configuration data or database entries
    that define faction restrictions. It's important to ensure that the faction team
    parameter is valid (typically FACTION_TEAM_ALLIANCE or FACTION_TEAM_HORDE) to
    avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation likely involves checking flags or
    lookup tables rather than complex computations.
  warnings: Ensure that faction IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond
    to expected constants like FACTION_TEAM_ALLIANCE or FACTION_TEAM_HORDE. Incorrectly
    passing invalid faction values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect zone
    access decisions.
