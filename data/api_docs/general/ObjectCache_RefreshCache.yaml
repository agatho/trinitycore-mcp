  class: ObjectCache
  method: RefreshCache
  signature: void ObjectCache::RefreshCache(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Refreshes the object cache for the specified player, updating cached data
    to reflect current game state.
  description: The RefreshCache method updates the internal cache of objects associated
    with a given player in the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that any
    subsequently retrieved cached data is current and reflects the most recent state
    of the player's environment. It typically handles invalidating stale entries,
    re-fetching necessary data from the game world, and updating internal mappings
    or references. The operation is essential for maintaining consistency between
    client-side caching and server-side game state, particularly in AI-driven systems
    where bots rely on accurate object information. This method should be called when
    significant changes occur in a player's surroundings or when cached data may have
    become outdated.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose cache needs to be refreshed. Must
      not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Logic
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Refresh cache before performing actions\n\
      \    ObjectCache::RefreshCache(m_bot);\n    \n    // Now proceed with logic\
      \ that depends on fresh data\n    auto nearbyObjects = m_objectCache.GetNearbyObjects(m_bot,\
      \ 50.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database or world server queries depending on implementation
    details. It is recommended to call this sparingly in performance-critical sections
    to avoid unnecessary overhead. The refresh operation might involve locking mechanisms
    internally to ensure thread safety during updates.
  warnings: Calling RefreshCache with a null player pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the provided Player object is valid
    and currently in the game world before invoking this method.
