  method: GetMaxRatingDifference
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundMgr::GetMaxRatingDifference() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum rating difference allowed for battleground matchmaking.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum Elo rating difference permitted between
    players when matching them into battlegrounds. This value is used by the battleground
    system to ensure balanced matchmaking by preventing players with significantly
    different ratings from being matched together. The returned value typically represents
    a threshold in rating points that determines whether two players are considered
    suitable opponents for competitive play.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum allowed rating difference in Elo
    points. This value is used internally by the battleground matching system to filter
    potential opponents based on their relative skill levels.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve max rating difference for matchmaking
    code: 'uint32 maxDiff = sBattlegroundMgr->GetMaxRatingDifference();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_BATTLEGROUND, "Maximum rating difference allowed: %u",
      maxDiff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This value is typically configured in the game's configuration files or database
    and may vary depending on the battleground type and player level ranges. The method
    is thread-safe as it only reads a cached configuration value.
