documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the last error message that occurred within the BotWorldEntry instance
  description: The GetLastError method returns a string representation of the most
    recently encountered error within the BotWorldEntry class. This method is typically
    used for debugging and error handling purposes to provide developers with insight
    into what went wrong during operations involving bot world entries. The error
    message may contain details about failed operations, invalid states, or other
    runtime issues that occurred within the context of this specific bot world entry
    instance. It's important to note that calling this method does not clear the error
    state; subsequent calls will continue to return the same error message until a
    new error occurs or the error is explicitly cleared by the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the last error message that occurred within this
    BotWorldEntry instance. If no errors have occurred since initialization or the
    last clear operation, an empty string may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Retrieval
    code: "BotWorldEntry entry;\n// ... some operations that might fail ...\nstd::string\
      \ lastError = entry.GetLastError();\nif (!lastError.empty()) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Error occurred: \" << lastError << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other BotWorldEntry operations
    that may fail. The returned error string should be treated as read-only and not
    modified by the caller. It's recommended to check for errors after critical operations
    to ensure proper handling of exceptional conditions.
  warnings: The error state persists until explicitly cleared or a new error occurs,
    so repeated calls to GetLastError will return the same message unless the underlying
    error condition changes. Developers should be aware that this method does not
    automatically clear previous errors, which could lead to confusion if not properly
    managed.
