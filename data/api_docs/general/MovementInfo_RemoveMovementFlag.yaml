documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified movement flag from the MovementInfo object
  description: The RemoveMovementFlag method is used to clear or disable a specific
    movement flag within the MovementInfo class. This functionality is essential for
    managing player or creature movement states in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation. The method modifies the internal flags storage by removing
    the bit corresponding to the specified flag value. This operation directly affects
    how movement data is serialized and transmitted to clients, ensuring accurate
    representation of entity movement states during gameplay. The method does not
    validate whether the flag was previously set, making it safe to call even when
    the flag is not currently active.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The movement flag value to be removed from the current MovementInfo
      object. This should be one of the predefined movement flag constants such as
      MOVEFLAG_NONE, MOVEFLAG_FORWARD, MOVEFLAG_BACKWARD, etc., defined in the TrinityCore
      movement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a single movement flag
    code: 'MovementInfo moveInfo;

      moveInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_FORWARD);

      moveInfo.RemoveMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_FORWARD); // Removes the forward movement
      flag'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing multiple movement flags
    code: 'MovementInfo moveInfo;

      moveInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_FORWARD);

      moveInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_BACKWARD);

      moveInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_LEFT);

      moveInfo.RemoveMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_LEFT); // Only removes the left turn flag

      moveInfo.RemoveMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_BACKWARD); // Removes the backward movement
      flag'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a bitfield-based system where each movement flag
    corresponds to a specific bit position. The implementation assumes that the internal
    flag storage is properly initialized and accessible. Performance-wise, this operation
    is O(1) as it only involves bitwise operations. When working with MovementInfo
    objects in multiplayer environments, ensure that flag changes are synchronized
    appropriately across server instances.
  warnings: Calling RemoveMovementFlag with an invalid or undefined movement flag
    value may result in unexpected behavior. Always use predefined constants from
    the movement flag enumeration to avoid unintended side effects. Be cautious when
    removing flags during active movement processing as it might affect client-side
    interpolation and prediction logic.
