  class: TargetScanner
  method: TargetScanner
  signature: void TargetScanner::TargetScanner(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a TargetScanner instance for the specified player bot, setting
    up internal target tracking and scanning logic.
  description: The TargetScanner constructor initializes the scanner with a specific
    player bot reference. This method sets up the necessary internal state to track
    and scan for valid targets within the bot's current environment. It prepares the
    scanner to perform target selection operations based on predefined criteria such
    as threat level, distance, and target type. The initialization process typically
    involves setting up target lists, clearing previous scan results, and configuring
    scanning parameters specific to the bot's role and class. This constructor should
    be called before any target scanning operations are performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use this
      TargetScanner instance. Must not be null and must represent a valid player entity
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TargetScanner Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot

      TargetScanner scanner(myBot);

      // scanner is now ready for target scanning operations'
    language: cpp
  - title: TargetScanner in Bot AI Context
    code: "class MyBotAI : public PlayerbotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (GetBot()) {\n            TargetScanner scanner(GetBot());\n\
      \            // Perform target scanning logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The TargetScanner constructor does not perform any immediate target scanning;
    it only initializes the internal state. Actual target scanning should be performed
    via dedicated scanning methods after initialization. The bot parameter must remain
    valid for the lifetime of the TargetScanner instance to prevent dangling pointer
    issues.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the bot parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player reference is valid and represents
    an actual bot entity before constructing the TargetScanner. Avoid constructing
    multiple TargetScanner instances for the same bot without proper cleanup.
