  class: DevastationEvoker
  method: ConsumeEssence
  signature: void DevastationEvoker::ConsumeEssence(uint8 charges)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes essence charges from the DevastationEvoker instance.
  description: The ConsumeEssence method reduces the number of essence charges available
    to a DevastationEvoker instance by the specified amount. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's spell or ability systems where evokers
    consume magical essence to power their abilities. The implementation likely updates
    internal state variables tracking essence reserves and may trigger visual or auditory
    effects depending on the remaining charge count. It is expected that this method
    will not allow negative charges to be consumed, and may perform validation checks
    before reducing the charge count.
  parameters:
  - name: charges
    description: The number of essence charges to consume from the evoker. Must be
      a non-negative integer value representing the quantity of charges to reduce.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Consumption
    code: 'DevastationEvoker evoker;

      evoker.ConsumeEssence(3); // Consumes 3 essence charges'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Essence Consumption
    code: "if (evoker.GetRemainingCharges() >= 5) {\n    evoker.ConsumeEssence(5);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle insufficient charges\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the evoker's internal essence tracking
    system. It may be called during spell casting or ability activation to deduct
    required essence. The implementation should ensure thread safety if multiple threads
    can access the same evoker instance concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method with a charge value greater than the current available
    charges will result in undefined behavior or potential crashes unless bounds checking
    is implemented. Always validate input parameters before calling this method.
