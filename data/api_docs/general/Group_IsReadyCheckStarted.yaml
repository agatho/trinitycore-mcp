documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a ready check has been initiated for the group
  description: This method determines if a ready check is currently active within
    the group. A ready check is typically initiated when a group leader or raid leader
    wants to verify that all members are ready to proceed with an action, such as
    entering a dungeon or starting a raid encounter. The method returns true if a
    ready check has been started and is pending completion, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft's group and raid systems to
    synchronize player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a ready check has been initiated for the group and is currently
    active; returns false if no ready check is in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Ready Check is Active
    code: "if (group->IsReadyCheckStarted()) {\n    // Handle case where ready check\
      \ is ongoing\n    sLog->outString(\"Ready check is currently active.\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Start a new ready check or proceed with normal operations\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"No ready check in progress.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Group::StartReadyCheck()
    and Group::CompleteReadyCheck(). The implementation likely tracks an internal
    flag or state variable that indicates whether a ready check has been initiated
    but not yet completed.
