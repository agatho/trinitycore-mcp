documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerScript instance with the specified name for event handling.
  description: The PlayerScript constructor initializes a new player script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used to register custom player
    event handlers within the TrinityCore framework. The name parameter serves as
    an identifier for the script, allowing the core system to distinguish between
    different script implementations. During initialization, the script may perform
    setup operations such as registering event callbacks or initializing internal
    state variables. This constructor is part of the scripting system that enables
    developers to extend player behavior through custom code without modifying core
    game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this PlayerScript
      instance. The name is used by the TrinityCore framework to manage and dispatch
      player events to the correct script handler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerScript Initialization
    code: "class MyPlayerScript : public PlayerScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyPlayerScript()\
      \ : PlayerScript(\"MyCustomPlayerScript\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: PlayerScript with Event Registration
    code: "class QuestRewardScript : public PlayerScript\n{\npublic:\n    QuestRewardScript()\
      \ : PlayerScript(\"QuestRewardHandler\")\n    {\n        // Register for specific\
      \ player events\n        // This would typically involve calling registration\
      \ methods\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PlayerScript constructor should only be called during object initialization.
    It's important to ensure that the name parameter is unique across all registered
    scripts to prevent conflicts in event handling. The constructor does not perform
    any complex operations; its primary purpose is to set up the script identification
    and prepare for event registration.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that each PlayerScript
    instance has a unique name to avoid conflicts in the event handling system.
