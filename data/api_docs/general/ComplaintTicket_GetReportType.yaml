documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the report type associated with the complaint ticket.
  description: The GetReportType method returns the specific type of complaint or
    report that this ticket represents. This enumeration value determines how the
    ticket should be processed and categorized within the TrinityCore system. The
    returned ReportType enum indicates the nature of the player's complaint, such
    as cheating, harassment, or game exploit reports. This method is typically used
    by the GM ticketing system to route complaints to appropriate staff members based
    on their severity or category.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a ReportType enumeration value that represents the category of
    the complaint. Possible values include but are not limited to: REPORT_TYPE_CHEATING,
    REPORT_TYPE_HARASSMENT, REPORT_TYPE_EXPLOIT, REPORT_TYPE_GAME_ERROR, and others
    depending on the game''s implementation.'

  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify any internal state of
    the ticket. It's safe to call multiple times without side effects. The ReportType
    enumeration values are defined in the TrinityCore codebase and may vary between
    different versions or custom modifications.
