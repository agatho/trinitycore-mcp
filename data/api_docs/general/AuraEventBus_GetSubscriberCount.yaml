  method: GetSubscriberCount
  signature: uint32 AuraEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the AuraEventBus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers registered within the AuraEventBus. This method is typically used
    for debugging, monitoring, or performance analysis purposes to understand how
    many systems are currently listening to aura-related events. The count includes
    all subscribers regardless of their specific event type or filter criteria. This
    method performs a thread-safe read operation on an internal counter that is updated
    whenever subscribers are added or removed from the bus.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the AuraEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Subscriber Count
    code: "uint32 count = auraEventBus.GetSubscriberCount();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Active subscribers: \" << count << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Subscriber Growth During Aura Application
    code: 'Aura* aura = player->AddAura(spellId, target);

      uint32 beforeCount = auraEventBus.GetSubscriberCount();

      // Apply aura logic here

      uint32 afterCount = auraEventBus.GetSubscriberCount();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("aura", "Subscribers before: %u, after: %u", beforeCount, afterCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current subscriber count and does
    not account for concurrent modifications that may occur during execution. The
    internal counter is updated atomically to ensure thread safety, but the returned
    value may be stale by the time it's used in subsequent logic.
  warnings: The subscriber count may fluctuate rapidly in high-frequency event scenarios.
    Using this method in performance-critical code paths should be avoided as it may
    introduce unnecessary overhead or race conditions if not properly synchronized
    with other operations.
