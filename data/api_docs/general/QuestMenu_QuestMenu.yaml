documentation:
  brief: Moves a QuestMenu object to another QuestMenu object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The QuestMenu move constructor transfers all resources from the source
    QuestMenu object to the destination QuestMenu object. This operation is typically
    used when creating new QuestMenu instances or reassigning existing ones in a performance-optimized
    manner. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation and should
    not be used. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this constructor
    is commonly involved in quest system operations where temporary or dynamic quest
    menus are created and managed during player interactions with NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a QuestMenu
    code: 'QuestMenu menu1;

      // ... populate menu1 ...

      QuestMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1); // Moves resources from menu1 to menu2

      // menu1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficiency
    by transferring ownership rather than copying data. The moved-from object should
    not be accessed after the operation.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any references or pointers to the source object are not
    used post-move.
