    for buyer-related configuration options. This method is typically called when
    creating a new buyer configuration object to manage how items are purchased or
    traded within the game environment. The initialization process may involve setting
    default thresholds, enabling/disabling certain purchase behaviors, and preparing
    internal state for subsequent operations.

    calls. It only initializes internal member variables and data structures. The
    class may require additional setup through other methods before it can be used
    effectively in a trading context.
