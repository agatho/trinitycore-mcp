  signature: void Unit::DisableSpline()
documentation:
  brief: Disables the spline movement animation for the unit, preventing smooth path
    following.
  description: The DisableSpline method stops a unit from using spline-based movement
    animations, which are typically used for smooth, curved paths during movement.
    When called, this method effectively forces the unit to use immediate teleportation
    or straight-line movement instead of animated spline interpolation. This can be
    useful in scenarios where precise control over unit positioning is required, such
    as during combat maneuvers, scripted events, or when transitioning between different
    movement states. The method does not affect the unit's underlying movement logic,
    but rather modifies how the movement is visually represented to clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable spline for a player during combat
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->DisableSpline();

      // Player will now move with immediate teleportation instead of spline animation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a custom AI behavior
    code: "void CustomAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    me->DisableSpline();\n\
      \    // Ensures no spline movement during initial combat charge\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the visual representation of movement for clients
    and does not alter the actual movement calculations. The unit's position and movement
    logic remain unchanged, but the client will not see smooth spline interpolation.
    This can be useful for performance optimization in high-frequency movement scenarios.
  warnings: Calling DisableSpline() during active movement may cause sudden visual
    jumps if the unit's position is updated without proper synchronization. Ensure
    that any movement updates are properly coordinated with the client to avoid visual
    artifacts or desynchronization.
