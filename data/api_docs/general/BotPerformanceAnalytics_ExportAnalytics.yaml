documentation:
  brief: Exports bot performance analytics data to a specified file.
  description: The ExportAnalytics method serializes and writes the collected bot
    performance metrics to a file with the given filename. This functionality is typically
    used for post-processing or analysis of bot behavior and performance over time.
    The exported data may include statistics such as response times, success rates,
    resource usage, and other relevant performance indicators. The method operates
    on the current state of analytics data stored within the BotPerformanceAnalytics
    instance and does not modify the internal state. It is designed to be called during
    shutdown or at regular intervals for monitoring purposes.

      // ... populate analytics data ...

      analytics.ExportAnalytics("bot_performance_report.txt");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely intended for debugging and performance monitoring.
    It may block during file I/O operations, so it should not be called frequently
    in performance-critical sections of code.
