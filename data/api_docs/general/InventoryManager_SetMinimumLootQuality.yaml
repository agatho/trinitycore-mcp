documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum quality level for loot that can be added to an inventory.
  description: The SetMinimumLootQuality method configures the minimum item quality
    threshold for loot items that are eligible to be added to an inventory. This setting
    affects how loot is processed and whether items meet the criteria for inclusion
    in the player's inventory or loot containers. The quality parameter should correspond
    to standard World of Warcraft item quality values (0 = Poor, 1 = Common, 2 = Uncommon,
    3 = Rare, 4 = Epic, 5 = Legendary, 6 = Artifact). This method is typically used
    during gameplay events or by game masters to adjust loot behavior dynamically.
    The change takes effect immediately and affects subsequent loot operations.
  parameters:
  - name: quality
    description: 'The minimum quality level for loot items. Valid values are integers
      from 0 to 6 representing item qualities: 0 = Poor, 1 = Common, 2 = Uncommon,
      3 = Rare, 4 = Epic, 5 = Legendary, 6 = Artifact.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set minimum loot quality to rare
    code: inventoryManager->SetMinimumLootQuality(3); // Only items with quality 'Rare'
      or higher will be added to inventory
    language: cpp
  - title: Set minimum loot quality to legendary
    code: inventoryManager->SetMinimumLootQuality(5); // Only items with quality 'Legendary'
      or higher will be added to inventory
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that affects loot processing logic. It
    is recommended to call this method before initiating loot operations to ensure
    consistent behavior. The change impacts all subsequent loot additions to the inventory
    and does not retroactively filter existing items.
  warnings: Setting a very high quality threshold (e.g., 6 for Artifact) may result
    in no loot being added to the inventory if no items meet that criteria, potentially
    leading to empty loot containers or unexpected gameplay behavior. Ensure quality
    values are within valid range (0-6).
