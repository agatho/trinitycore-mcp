api:
  class: SpellHistory
  method: PauseCooldowns
  signature: void SpellHistory::PauseCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Pauses all spell cooldowns for the associated unit.
  description: The PauseCooldowns method temporarily halts the progression of all
    active spell cooldowns for the unit that owns this SpellHistory instance. This
    is commonly used during game events, player states like being stunned or silenced,
    or when applying certain debuffs that prevent spell casting. The method does not
    reset cooldowns; it simply suspends their advancement until resumed via the corresponding
    ResumeCooldowns method. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    game balance and ensuring that mechanics such as silence effects or stuns correctly
    prevent spell usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Pausing Cooldowns During Stun Effect
    code: "void Unit::OnStunApply()\n{\n    if (m_spellHistory)\n        m_spellHistory->PauseCooldowns();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat State Management
    code: "void Player::HandleCombatStateChange(bool inCombat)\n{\n    if (inCombat)\n\
      \        m_spellHistory->PauseCooldowns();\n    else\n        m_spellHistory->ResumeCooldowns();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all cooldowns for the unit, not just specific spells.
    It's important to ensure that PauseCooldowns is paired with a corresponding ResumeCooldowns
    call to avoid permanent cooldown suspension. The implementation likely uses a
    timer-based system internally to track paused states.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without a matching ResumeCooldowns can lead
    to players being unable to cast spells indefinitely, which may cause game balance
    issues or player frustration. Always ensure proper state management when calling
    this function.
