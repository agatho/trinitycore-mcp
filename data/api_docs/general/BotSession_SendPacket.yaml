  class: BotSession
  method: SendPacket
  signature: void BotSession::SendPacket(const int * packet, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the client associated with this bot session, optionally
    forcing transmission regardless of normal send conditions.
  description: The SendPacket method is responsible for transmitting network packets
    from the server to the client in the context of a bot session. It allows for sending
    game data such as player actions, world updates, or other protocol messages. The
    'forced' parameter determines whether the packet should be sent immediately, bypassing
    normal queuing and throttling mechanisms that might otherwise delay transmission.
    This is particularly useful for critical updates or when immediate client feedback
    is required. The method operates within the TrinityCore framework's networking
    layer and interacts with the underlying session management system to ensure proper
    delivery of packets to the connected client.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to an integer array representing the packet data to be
      sent. This typically contains serialized network protocol data that conforms
      to World of Warcraft's packet structure. The array must contain valid packet
      bytes and should be properly formatted for the target client version.
  - name: forced
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the packet should be sent immediately
      (true) or queued for normal processing (false). When set to true, the packet
      bypasses standard send queues and is transmitted as soon as possible, which
      may impact performance if used excessively.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Sending
    code: 'int packetData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04};

      botSession->SendPacket(packetData, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Packet Transmission
    code: 'int criticalPacket[] = {0xFF, 0xFE, 0xFD};

      botSession->SendPacket(criticalPacket, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as forcing packet transmission can impact
    server performance and network stability. It is recommended to use the 'forced'
    parameter sparingly and only when necessary for gameplay-critical updates. The
    packet data must be properly formatted according to the World of Warcraft client
    protocol; otherwise, it may result in connection drops or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of forced packet sending can lead to network congestion and
    performance degradation. Always validate packet data before sending to prevent
    malformed packets from being transmitted. Sending too many forced packets can
    cause clients to disconnect due to excessive bandwidth usage or protocol violations.
