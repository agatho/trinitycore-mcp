  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: PruneOldPatterns
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::PruneOldPatterns(uint32_t olderThanHours)
documentation:
  brief: Removes outdated pattern entries from the player's pattern recognition data
    that are older than the specified time threshold.
  description: The PruneOldPatterns method cleans up the player's pattern recognition
    data by removing any stored patterns that have exceeded their retention period.
    This method is typically invoked to manage memory usage and ensure that only relevant,
    recent patterns are maintained in the system. It operates on a time-based threshold
    where patterns older than the specified number of hours are deleted from the internal
    storage. The cleanup process helps maintain performance and prevents the accumulation
    of stale data that may no longer be useful for pattern recognition algorithms
    or player behavior analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: olderThanHours
    description: Specifies the age threshold in hours. Any pattern entries older than
      this value will be removed from the player's pattern recognition database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to prune patterns older than 24 hours
    code: playerPatternRecognition->PruneOldPatterns(24);
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic cleanup of old patterns every hour
    code: "void CleanupPlayerPatterns(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetPlayerPatternRecognition())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetPlayerPatternRecognition()->PruneOldPatterns(48);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal data structure that tracks pattern
    timestamps. It may be called periodically by the game server to maintain optimal
    performance and memory usage. The pruning operation is typically non-blocking
    and does not affect active gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently as it might cause
    unnecessary overhead. Also, be aware that pruning patterns older than a certain
    threshold could impact pattern recognition accuracy if the time window is too
    restrictive.
