  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: Update
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawner state based on elapsed time since last update.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing the internal logic
    of the BotSpawnerAdapter class. It handles spawning and managing bot instances
    according to configured intervals and conditions. This method is typically called
    from the game loop with a time delta parameter that indicates how much time has
    passed since the last execution. The implementation may check for spawn conditions,
    manage existing bots, and ensure proper cleanup or respawn behavior based on server
    settings and game state.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine when to trigger bot spawning logic and manage timing-based
      operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    botSpawnerAdapter->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to ensure
    proper bot spawning behavior. The 'diff' parameter is crucial for accurate timing
    of bot spawns and should reflect actual elapsed time between calls.
