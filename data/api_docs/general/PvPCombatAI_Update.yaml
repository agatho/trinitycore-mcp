  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: Update
  signature: void PvPCombatAI::Update(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the PvP combat AI state based on elapsed time and player data.
  description: The Update method in PvPCombatAI is responsible for managing the artificial
    intelligence behavior of player characters during PvP encounters. It processes
    the passage of time (via the diff parameter) to determine when to perform AI actions
    such as targeting, casting spells, or moving. The method takes a pointer to an
    integer representing the player's current state and updates it according to combat
    logic. This function is typically called every game tick by the core engine to
    ensure responsive and dynamic PvP behavior. The implementation likely includes
    checks for player health, mana levels, target validity, and cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current player state or identifier
      within the PvP combat context. This value may be modified by the AI logic during
      update cycles.
  - name: diff
    description: Time elapsed since last update in milliseconds. Used to determine
      when to trigger AI actions based on timing requirements like spell cooldowns
      or movement delays.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'int playerState = 0;

      uint32 deltaTime = 100;

      PvPCombatAI ai;

      ai.Update(&playerState, deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdatePvPCombat()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ currentTime = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n\
      \    \n    if (diff > 50) // Update every 50ms\n    {\n        int playerState\
      \ = GetPlayerState();\n        PvPCombatAI* ai = GetPvPCombatAI();\n       \
      \ ai->Update(&playerState, diff);\n        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI system and should be called regularly
    to maintain responsive PvP behavior. The player parameter may be modified during
    execution, so callers should ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded
    contexts.
  warnings: Do not call this method without valid parameters; passing null for 'player'
    or invalid 'diff' values can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the AI system
    is properly initialized before calling Update.
