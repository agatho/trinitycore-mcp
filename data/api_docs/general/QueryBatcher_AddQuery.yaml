  method: AddQuery
  signature: void QueryBatcher::AddQuery(int bot, float x, float y, float z, float
    range, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a query to the batcher for bot position and zone data retrieval.
  description: The AddQuery method in QueryBatcher is used to register a new query
    for retrieving bot-related data within a specified area. It takes the bot's identifier,
    coordinates (x, y, z), a search range, and the zone ID as parameters. This method
    allows for efficient batch processing of multiple queries by accumulating them
    before executing a single database operation. The method does not return any value
    but stores the query internally for later execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot entity to query.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the location to search around.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the location to search around.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the location to search around.
  - name: range
    description: The radius within which to search for relevant data.
  - name: zoneId
    description: The ID of the zone where the query should be executed.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'QueryBatcher batcher;

      batcher.AddQuery(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 50.0f, 1234);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with a batch execution mechanism
    to reduce database load by grouping multiple queries into one operation. The actual
    database query may not be executed until Flush() or similar methods are called
    on the QueryBatcher.
