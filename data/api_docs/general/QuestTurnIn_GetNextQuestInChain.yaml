  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: GetNextQuestInChain
  signature: uint32 QuestTurnIn::GetNextQuestInChain(uint32 completedQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest ID of the next quest in the chain following a completed
    quest.
  description: The GetNextQuestInChain method determines and returns the unique identifier
    (ID) of the next quest that should be offered to the player after completing the
    specified quest. This functionality is essential for managing quest chains in
    World of Warcraft, where quests are often linked together sequentially. The method
    evaluates the quest relationship data stored within the game's database to identify
    which quest should follow a given completed quest. It ensures proper progression
    through quest lines and maintains the logical flow of story-driven content. The
    method does not modify any quest state or player progress directly; it simply
    retrieves the next quest ID based on predefined quest chain relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: completedQuestId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that has been completed by
      the player. This parameter must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database,
      otherwise the method may return zero or an invalid quest ID.
  returns: Returns the quest ID of the next quest in the chain following the specified
    completed quest. If no subsequent quest exists in the chain or if the input quest
    ID is invalid, the method returns zero (0). A non-zero return value indicates
    a valid quest that should be made available to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 nextQuestId = questTurnIn->GetNextQuestInChain(12345);\nif (nextQuestId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with offering the next quest to player\n    player->AddQuest(nextQuestId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Chain Validation
    code: "uint32 currentQuestId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345);\nif (currentQuestId\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    uint32 nextQuestId = questTurnIn->GetNextQuestInChain(12345);\n\
      \    if (nextQuestId != 0 && !player->HasQuest(nextQuestId))\n    {\n      \
      \  // Offer the next quest in chain\n        player->AddQuest(nextQuestId);\n\
      \        player->SendQuestComplete(nextQuestId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest relationship tables and assumes that
    quest chains are properly defined in the database. It does not perform any validation
    of the quest status or player progress beyond retrieving the next quest ID. The
    method is typically used during quest completion processing to determine what
    quest should be offered next in a sequence.
  warnings: Ensure that the completedQuestId parameter corresponds to an actual completed
    quest, as passing an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result in incorrect
    behavior or return values. This method does not handle quest prerequisites or
    conditions beyond chain relationships; additional checks may be required for full
    quest progression validation.
