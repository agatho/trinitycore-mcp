  brief: Resets the loot mode for the creature, clearing all loot flags and restoring
    default loot behavior.
  description: The ResetLootMode method clears all active loot modes for a creature,
    effectively resetting its loot configuration to default state. This method is
    typically used when a creature's loot table needs to be reinitialized or when
    the loot mode has been modified through previous operations. It ensures that any
    previously set loot flags are cleared and the creature returns to standard loot
    behavior, allowing for proper loot distribution according to the game mechanics.
    The method does not require any parameters and operates on the creature object
    itself.

    the creature. It is typically called when a creature's loot mode needs to be reset
    after modifications or during specific game events.
