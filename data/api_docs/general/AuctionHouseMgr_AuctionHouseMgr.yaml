  brief: Moves an AuctionHouseMgr object to another AuctionHouseMgr object, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: This is a move constructor for the AuctionHouseMgr class. It transfers
    all internal resources and state from the source AuctionHouseMgr object to the
    current object, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state. This operation
    is typically used when an AuctionHouseMgr instance needs to be efficiently transferred
    between scopes or containers without performing expensive deep copies. The method
    is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for managing auction house data
    structures within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Move AuctionHouseMgr instance to new variable
    code: 'AuctionHouseMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with data ...

      AuctionHouseMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing AuctionHouseMgr objects in containers or during object transfers.
    It's important to note that after a move operation, the source object should not
    be used unless it's subsequently assigned to or moved from again.
  warnings: Using the move constructor on an already moved-from object results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure proper usage patterns are followed to avoid resource
    leaks or corruption.
