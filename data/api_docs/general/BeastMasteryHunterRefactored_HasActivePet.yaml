documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the hunter has an active beast pet summoned.
  description: The HasActivePet method determines if the hunter currently has a valid
    active beast pet summoned. This is typically used in pet-related logic, such as
    determining whether a hunter can cast certain spells that require an active pet,
    or to check if a pet is available for commands like attack, follow, or stay. The
    method evaluates internal state flags and pet validity to return true if a pet
    exists and is currently active, false otherwise. This check is essential for proper
    handling of hunter pet mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has an active beast pet summoned; returns false
    if no pet is active or if the pet is not valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pet Logic
    code: "if (player->ToPlayer()->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetHunter()->HasActivePet())\
      \ {\n    // Perform action requiring an active pet\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_HUNTER_PET_ATTACK, true);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no pet\
      \ is active\n    player->SendNotification(\"You must have a pet summoned to\
      \ use this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the hunter's pet, including
    pet validity, summon status, and whether it's currently active in the world. It
    does not perform any external checks or database lookups.
