documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creation timestamp of the guild.
  description: The GetCreatedDate method returns the Unix timestamp indicating when
    the guild was created. This value is typically set at the time of guild creation
    and remains constant throughout the guild's existence. The returned time_t value
    represents seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This
    method is useful for determining guild age, implementing time-based features,
    or sorting guilds by creation date. No parameters are required, and the method
    performs no side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of when the guild was created.
    Returns 0 if the guild has not been initialized or if there is an internal error
    retrieving the creation date.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Guild Creation Date
    code: "time_t createdDate = guild->GetCreatedDate();\nif (createdDate != 0)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Guild created on: \" << ctime(&createdDate) << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Guild Age in Days
    code: "time_t createdDate = guild->GetCreatedDate();\nif (createdDate != 0)\n\
      {\n    time_t now = time(nullptr);\n    double secondsSinceCreation = difftime(now,\
      \ createdDate);\n    int daysSinceCreation = static_cast<int>(secondsSinceCreation\
      \ / (60 * 60 * 24));\n    std::cout << \"Guild is \" << daysSinceCreation <<\
      \ \" days old.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned timestamp is in UTC. This method assumes that the guild object
    has been properly initialized with valid data. If the guild was created before
    the Unix epoch, this may result in a negative time_t value. The method is thread-safe
    as long as the Guild object itself is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the Guild object is valid and initialized before calling this
    method, as calling it on an uninitialized or corrupted guild object might return
    unexpected values. Also note that the returned value does not account for time
    zone differences; it's always in UTC.
