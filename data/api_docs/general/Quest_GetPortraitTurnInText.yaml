documentation:
  brief: Returns the portrait turn-in text for a quest, which is displayed when players
    interact with quest givers.
  description: This method retrieves the portrait turn-in text associated with a specific
    quest, which is used in the game's quest system to provide contextual information
    about what the player needs to do to complete the quest. The returned string typically
    contains the text that appears in the quest dialog when players interact with
    quest givers, and it's often used for displaying quest objectives or requirements.
    This method is part of the Quest class and provides access to quest-specific text
    data that may be used in conjunction with other quest-related methods like GetPortraitTurnInText
    or GetQuestText.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const std::string& representing the portrait turn-in text for
    the quest. This string contains the text that appears when players interact with
    quest givers and is typically used to display quest objectives or requirements
    in the game's quest system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      std::string turnInText = quest->GetPortraitTurnInText();

      // Displays the portrait turn-in text for quest 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to provide full quest information. It's important to note that this method returns
    a reference to a string, so modifying the returned value will affect the original
    quest object. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls to
    this method during gameplay.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return an empty string if
    no portrait turn-in text is defined for the quest. Also, since it returns a reference,
    modifications to the returned string will modify the original quest object, which
    can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.
