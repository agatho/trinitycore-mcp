  method: CalculateResourceEfficiency
  signature: float MonkAI::CalculateResourceEfficiency()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource efficiency ratio for a Monk AI character.
  description: The CalculateResourceEfficiency method computes a float value representing
    how effectively a Monk AI character utilizes its resources, such as energy or
    chi, during combat. This calculation typically factors in the usage of abilities,
    the timing of resource generation, and overall performance metrics to determine
    an efficiency score. The returned value is generally normalized between 0.0 (inefficient)
    and 1.0 (optimal efficiency), though specific implementation details may vary
    based on game mechanics and AI behavior logic. This method is primarily used for
    evaluating AI performance or tuning Monk combat strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated resource efficiency of the Monk
    AI, typically ranging from 0.0 (least efficient) to 1.0 (most efficient).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float efficiency = monkAI.CalculateResourceEfficiency();\nif (efficiency\
      \ > 0.8f)\n{\n    // Consider this AI performance optimal\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during combat simulations or AI decision-making
    processes, so performance considerations should be taken into account. The exact
    formula for efficiency calculation is internal to the AI implementation and may
    vary depending on the specific Monk specialization (e.g., Brewmaster, Windwalker,
    Mistweaver).
