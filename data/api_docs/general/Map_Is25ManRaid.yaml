documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a 25-player raid instance.
  description: The Is25ManRaid method checks if the current Map object represents
    a 25-player raid instance, which is commonly used in World of Warcraft's raid
    content. This method is typically used to distinguish between normal and heroic
    difficulty instances, particularly for 25-player raids where players need to be
    aware of the specific raid size they are entering. The method returns true when
    the map is configured as a 25-player raid instance, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for determining player access and difficulty levels within raid content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current map is a 25-player raid instance, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the map supports 25-player raid content or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->Is25ManRaid()) {\n    // Player is in a 25-player raid\n    //\
      \ Proceed with raid-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to determine the difficulty level of a raid instance. It may be used in conjunction
    with Is10ManRaid() or Is25ManRaid() methods to determine which raid size a player
    is entering.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with Is10ManRaid() or Is25ManRaid()
    methods, as they are distinct and may return different values depending on the
    map's configuration. Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other
    difficulty-related functions.
