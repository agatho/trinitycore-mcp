  class: PathCache
  method: InvalidateRegion
  signature: void PathCache::InvalidateRegion(const int & center, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates pathfinding cache for a specified region around a center point.
  description: The InvalidateRegion method clears cached pathfinding data within a
    given radius from a specified center point in the game world. This is typically
    used when terrain changes, objects are added or removed, or when pathfinding data
    becomes stale due to dynamic world events. The method ensures that subsequent
    path requests in the invalidated region will recalculate paths using current world
    state rather than cached data. This helps maintain accurate navigation for NPCs
    and players in a dynamically changing game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the region to invalidate, represented as an integer
      identifier (likely a grid cell or zone ID).
  - name: radius
    description: The radius around the center point defining the area to invalidate,
      measured in world units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating a Region Around Player Position
    code: 'int playerZone = GetPlayer()->GetZoneId();

      float radius = 50.0f;

      PathCache::Instance()->InvalidateRegion(playerZone, radius);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Invalidating Region After Object Placement
    code: "void OnGameObjectAdd(GameObject* go) {\n    int zoneId = go->GetZoneId();\n\
      \    float radius = 30.0f;\n    PathCache::Instance()->InvalidateRegion(zoneId,\
      \ radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a cached pathfinding system that stores precomputed
    paths for performance reasons. Invalidating regions prevents using outdated path
    data when the world state changes. The implementation likely uses spatial partitioning
    to efficiently determine which cached paths fall within the invalidation radius.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can cause performance degradation as it
    forces recalculation of pathfinding data. Avoid invalidating large regions unnecessarily,
    especially during high-traffic periods. Ensure that the center parameter corresponds
    to a valid world region identifier to avoid undefined behavior.
