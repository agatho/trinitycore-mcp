  class: LootDistribution
  method: IsAccessoryUpgrade
  signature: bool LootDistribution::IsAccessoryUpgrade(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a loot item is an accessory upgrade for the specified
    player.
  description: The IsAccessoryUpgrade method evaluates if a given loot item qualifies
    as an accessory upgrade for the provided player. This typically involves checking
    if the item is a piece of equipment that enhances an existing accessory, such
    as upgrading a ring or trinket to a higher tier. The method likely considers factors
    like item level, type, and the player's current equipped accessories. It is used
    in loot distribution systems to determine appropriate upgrade mechanics within
    the game.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the loot item is being evaluated.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the item being checked.
      The item must have valid properties such as item level and type for proper evaluation.
  returns: Returns true if the loot item is considered an accessory upgrade for the
    player, otherwise false. This indicates whether the item should be treated as
    an enhancement to existing accessories rather than a new piece of gear.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution
    code: "if (lootDistribution.IsAccessoryUpgrade(player, lootItem)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ accessory upgrade logic\n    player->AddItem(lootItem.itemTemplate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Roll System
    code: "void HandleLootRoll(Player* player, LootItem& item) {\n    if (lootDistribution.IsAccessoryUpgrade(player,\
      \ item)) {\n        // Upgrade existing accessory\n        player->UpgradeAccessory(item.itemTemplate);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Normal loot distribution\n        player->AddItem(item.itemTemplate);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other loot distribution logic
    to ensure proper handling of accessory upgrades. It may involve checking the player's
    current inventory for matching accessories, comparing item levels, and verifying
    that the upgrade is valid according to game rules.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid before calling this
    method. Passing null pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The method
    assumes that the item has been properly initialized with valid data.
