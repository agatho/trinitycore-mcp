documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players in the battleground.
  description: The SendPacketToAll method broadcasts a WorldPacket to every player
    currently participating in the battleground. This method is typically used to
    send synchronized updates, game state changes, or announcements that all players
    need to receive simultaneously. The packet is sent directly to each player's socket
    without any filtering or conditional logic, ensuring all participants receive
    the message. This method operates within the context of the battleground's messaging
    system and should only be called from within a battleground instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a custom packet to all players
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CUSTOM_MESSAGE, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345);

      battleground->SendPacketToAll(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within a battleground context. It
    directly accesses player connections and may not be safe to call from other threads
    without proper synchronization. The packet is sent immediately without any queuing
    or delay.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null packet pointer will likely
    cause a crash. Ensure the WorldPacket is properly initialized before passing it
    to this method. Avoid calling this method during critical sections where player
    connections might be modified.
