documentation:
  brief: Replaces all NPC flags on the unit with the specified flags.
  description: This method replaces all existing NPC flags on a Unit object with the
    new NPCFlags provided. It is commonly used to update the NPC flags of creatures
    or NPCs in World of Warcraft, particularly when modifying their interaction behavior
    with players. The method ensures that only the specified flags are set, removing
    any previous flags that may have been present. This operation affects how the
    NPC interacts with players and can influence various game mechanics such as quest
    interactions, gossip options, and combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetCreature();


      // Replace all NPC flags with new flags

      NPCFlags flags = NPC_FLAG_GOSSIP | NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER;


      // Set the flags

      target->ReplaceAllNpcFlags(flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly modifies the NPC flags
    of a unit, which can affect how players interact with the NPC. The operation is
    typically performed during initialization or when updating NPC behavior dynamically.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect NPC behavior, such as
    missing quest options or incorrect gossip interactions. It should only be used
    when the flags are known and appropriate for the intended behavior.
