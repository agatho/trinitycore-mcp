documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SpatialGridScheduler instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpatialGridScheduler class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any internal data structures such as grids, cells, or spatial
    indexing components that manage game objects within a specific area. The destructor
    ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability when
    the scheduler is no longer needed. It is automatically invoked when the object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpatialGridScheduler
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SpatialGridScheduler scheduler;\n    // ...\
      \ use scheduler ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    memory integrity. It is important to ensure that no references to the scheduler
    exist after its destruction, as accessing freed memory can lead to undefined behavior.
    This destructor is typically not called directly but rather through normal object
    lifecycle management.
