  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: GetMarketId
  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetMarketId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the market identifier associated with this black market entry.
  description: The GetMarketId method returns the unique identifier that corresponds
    to the black market auction house where this entry is listed. This ID is used
    internally by the TrinityCore server to manage and reference specific market instances
    within the game's black market system. The returned value typically maps to a
    database entry in the black market tables, allowing the server to determine which
    auction house or market context the item belongs to. This method does not perform
    any validation or lookup operations; it simply returns the cached market ID stored
    within the BlackMarketEntry object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the market identifier associated with this black
    market entry. This value corresponds to a specific auction house or market context
    in the game's database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry* entry = ...;

      int marketId = entry->GetMarketId();

      printf("Market ID: %d\n", marketId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly returns a stored value. It's
    expected to be fast and thread-safe as it only accesses internal member variables
    without performing any database queries or complex operations.
