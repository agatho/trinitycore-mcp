documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is positioned behind its target within combat
    mechanics.
  description: The IsBehindTarget method evaluates the spatial relationship between
    the calling unit and its target to determine if the unit is located behind the
    target. This functionality is commonly used in combat specializations where positioning
    plays a critical role in determining effective attack strategies or spell casting.
    The method considers the orientation and relative positions of both units to make
    this determination, typically using angle calculations based on the unit's facing
    direction and the target's position. It returns true if the unit is determined
    to be behind the target, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the unit is positioned behind
    its target. True signifies that the unit is behind the target according to combat
    positioning rules; false indicates the unit is not behind the target or the evaluation
    could not be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsBehindTarget(target)) {\n    //\
      \ Apply positioning-based damage bonus\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_BEHIND_TARGET_BONUS,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making
    code: "if (npc->IsBehindTarget(player)) {\n    // Switch to ranged attack or spell\n\
      \    npc->CastSpell(player, SPELL_RANGED_ATTACK, true);\n} else {\n    // Approach\
      \ for melee combat\n    npc->AttackStart(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data and orientation information
    of both units. It may not account for complex terrain or obstacles that could
    affect actual line-of-sight or effective positioning in real-world scenarios.
    The implementation likely uses trigonometric calculations to determine angular
    relationships between the unit's facing direction and target position vector.
  warnings: The method assumes that both the calling unit and target have valid position
    and orientation data. Calling this method on units with invalid or uninitialized
    positions may result in undefined behavior. Additionally, this check is typically
    used for positioning-based mechanics and should not be relied upon for strict
    line-of-sight determination.
