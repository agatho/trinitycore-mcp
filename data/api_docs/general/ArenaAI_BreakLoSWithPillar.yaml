documentation:
  brief: Attempts to break line-of-sight with a pillar for the arena AI.
  description: The BreakLoSWithPillar method is used by the ArenaAI class to determine
    whether it can successfully break line-of-sight with an enemy target using a pillar
    object. This method evaluates the positioning of the player and enemy within the
    arena environment, checking if a pillar can be utilized to obstruct vision between
    them. It typically involves calculating positions, checking for valid pillar placement,
    and verifying that the obstruction is effective. The method returns true if the
    line-of-sight can be broken successfully, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI successfully breaks line-of-sight with a pillar,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena AI logic
    code: "if (arenaAI.BreakLoSWithPillar(&playerPosition, &enemyPosition)) {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with strategy that relies on obscured vision\n    DoStrategyWithObstruction();\n\
      } else {\n    // Fall back to standard targeting\n    UseStandardTargeting();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the arena's geometry and object placement
    logic. It may be used in conjunction with other AI behaviors such as positioning,
    movement, or spell casting to gain tactical advantages.
  warnings: The method assumes valid player and enemy positions are provided. Invalid
    or uninitialized data could lead to incorrect behavior or undefined results.
