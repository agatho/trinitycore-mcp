documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature is currently in combat state
  description: The IsInCombat method determines whether the AI-controlled creature
    is currently engaged in combat. This method evaluates the internal combat state
    of the creature and returns true if it is actively fighting, false otherwise.
    The check considers various factors such as active threat, aggro status, and combat
    timers to accurately determine the creature's engagement status. This functionality
    is essential for AI behavior logic that needs to differentiate between idle and
    combat states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently in combat, false if it is not
    engaged in any combat activity
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat State Check
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->IsInCombat()) {\n    // Creature is in combat, handle\
      \ accordingly\n    creature->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENRAGE, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Creature is not in combat, proceed with normal AI\n    creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat State Based Behavior Switching
    code: "if (combatAIIntegrator->IsInCombat()) {\n    // Execute combat-specific\
      \ actions\n    if (me->GetVictim() && me->IsWithinMeleeRange(me->GetVictim()))\
      \ {\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n} else {\n    // Execute non-combat\
      \ actions\n    if (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ != IDLE_MOTION_TYPE) {\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal combat state tracking mechanism of the
    AI system. The result may change dynamically during combat as threat levels and
    engagement status evolve. The implementation considers multiple factors including
    current target, threat table status, and combat timers to ensure accurate detection.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a sole indicator for combat-related actions
    without considering other state checks. The combat state can change rapidly during
    combat events, so frequent polling may cause performance overhead if used excessively
    in tight loops.
