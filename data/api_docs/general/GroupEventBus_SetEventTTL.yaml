  class: GroupEventBus
  method: SetEventTTL
  signature: void GroupEventBus::SetEventTTL(uint32 ttlMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time-to-live (TTL) for events in the group event bus.
  description: The SetEventTTL method configures the maximum lifetime of events within
    the GroupEventBus. This determines how long event data will be retained before
    being automatically cleaned up. The TTL value is specified in milliseconds and
    affects all subsequent events posted to the bus. This mechanism helps prevent
    memory leaks by ensuring that stale event data does not accumulate indefinitely.
    The method does not affect events that have already been processed or are currently
    active.
  parameters:
  - name: ttlMs
    description: The time-to-live value in milliseconds for events in the group event
      bus. Must be a positive integer representing the duration events should remain
      active before automatic cleanup.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Default TTL
    code: 'GroupEventBus bus;

      bus.SetEventTTL(30000); // Set TTL to 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Extended Event Retention
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = sGroupEventBus;

      eventBus->SetEventTTL(120000); // Set TTL to 2 minutes for extended event handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global event bus behavior and should be called before
    posting events. The TTL setting applies to all future events but does not retroactively
    modify existing event lifetimes.
  warnings: Setting a very low TTL value may cause events to expire before they can
    be properly processed, potentially leading to missed notifications or incomplete
    event handling sequences.
