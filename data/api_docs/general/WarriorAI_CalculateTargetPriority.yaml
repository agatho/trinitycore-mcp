  class: WarriorAI
  method: CalculateTargetPriority
  signature: float WarriorAI::CalculateTargetPriority(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a priority score for a target unit based on combat
    relevance and threat level.
  description: The CalculateTargetPriority method assesses the relative importance
    of a given target unit within the context of warrior AI behavior. It considers
    factors such as the target's health percentage, distance from the warrior, threat
    level, and any ongoing combat status to determine how urgently the warrior should
    engage that target. This priority score is used internally by the AI system to
    make decisions about which enemy to attack next or focus on during combat. The
    method does not modify the target or the warrior state; it only calculates a floating-point
    value representing the priority.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the potential target for
      evaluation. Must be a valid unit instance, typically an enemy player or creature.
      If null, behavior is undefined and may result in a crash or incorrect calculation.
  returns: A float value indicating the priority of the target. Higher values indicate
    higher priority, with 0.0 representing no priority or an invalid target. Values
    are typically between 0.0 and 1.0, though they may exceed 1.0 in special cases
    such as critical threat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "float priority = warriorAI->CalculateTargetPriority(enemyUnit);\nif (priority\
      \ > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Engage this target immediately\n    warriorAI->AttackStart(enemyUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding Highest Priority Target
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfloat highestPriority = 0.0f;\n\nfor (auto&\
      \ target : threatList)\n{\n    float priority = warriorAI->CalculateTargetPriority(target);\n\
      \    if (priority > highestPriority)\n    {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        bestTarget = target;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestTarget)\n    warriorAI->AttackStart(bestTarget);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI's internal threat management system
    and is typically called during AI update cycles. It may use cached threat data
    to improve performance, so calling it multiple times in quick succession might
    return consistent results unless the threat situation changes significantly.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as target will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crash the application. Always validate that the target unit is alive and valid
    before calling this method.
