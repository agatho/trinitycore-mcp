  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the BattlePetMgr instance, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for battle pet management operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BattlePetMgr class for managing
    battle pets within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically called
    during server startup or when a player logs in to ensure that all necessary data
    structures are properly allocated and initialized. It sets up internal containers
    for tracking battle pets, initializes any required subsystems, and ensures that
    the manager is ready to handle pet-related operations such as creation, deletion,
    and state management. The method performs no direct game logic but rather establishes
    the foundation upon which battle pet functionality relies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = new BattlePetMgr();

      mgr->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BattlePetMgr
    instance. Re-initialization may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The
    initialization process is typically handled automatically by the core framework,
    but manual calls might be needed in specific server configurations.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    resource leaks. Ensure that any existing data structures are properly destroyed
    before reinitializing.
