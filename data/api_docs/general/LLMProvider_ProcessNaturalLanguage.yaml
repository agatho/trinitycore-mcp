  class: LLMProvider
  method: ProcessNaturalLanguage
  signature: std::future<CommandResult> LLMProvider::ProcessNaturalLanguage(const
    CommandContext & context, CommandResponse & response)
documentation:
  brief: Processes natural language input from a command context and returns a future
    command result.
  description: The ProcessNaturalLanguage method is responsible for interpreting natural
    language commands provided through a CommandContext object. It asynchronously
    processes the input, potentially involving NLP parsing, intent recognition, and
    execution of appropriate game actions or responses. The method returns a std::future<CommandResult>
    which allows the calling code to await the completion of the processing and retrieve
    the result. This method is typically used in conjunction with command handling
    systems within TrinityCore's scripting or admin interfaces to enable human-readable
    command interpretation.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The CommandContext object containing the natural language input and
      associated metadata such as player, target, and command parameters.
  - name: response
    description: A reference to a CommandResponse object where the method will store
      its output or response data after processing the natural language command.
  returns: A std::future<CommandResult> that will eventually contain the result of
    processing the natural language command. The CommandResult typically includes
    status information, success/failure flags, and any generated output or feedback.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with async handling
    code: "auto future_result = llm_provider.ProcessNaturalLanguage(context, response);\n\
      // Later in code...\nCommandResult result = future_result.get();\nif (result.success)\
      \ {\n    // Handle successful command execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using std::async for non-blocking processing
    code: "std::future<CommandResult> future_result = std::async(std::launch::async,\
      \ [&]() {\n    return llm_provider.ProcessNaturalLanguage(context, response);\n\
      });\n// Do other work while waiting\nCommandResult result = future_result.get();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be asynchronous and should not block the calling
    thread. The CommandContext and CommandResponse objects must remain valid until
    the future is resolved. Implementation may involve complex NLP processing, database
    lookups, or interaction with game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that CommandContext and CommandResponse are properly initialized
    before passing them to this method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. The returned future should always be awaited or checked for validity
    before accessing its result.
