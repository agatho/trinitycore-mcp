  class: NPCEvent
  method: TrainerListReceived
  signature: NPCEvent NPCEvent::TrainerListReceived(int playerGuid, int npcGuid, uint32
    trainerEntry, int spells)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns an NPCEvent object indicating that a trainer list has
    been received by a player from an NPC.
  description: The TrainerListReceived method is used to generate an NPCEvent that
    signifies a successful interaction between a player and an NPC trainer, where
    the trainer's spell list has been retrieved and sent to the client. This event
    typically occurs when a player interacts with a trainer NPC, such as a class trainer
    or profession trainer, and the game engine sends the list of spells or skills
    the trainer can teach. The method encapsulates this interaction into an event
    object that can be processed by the game's event system for further handling,
    such as updating UI elements or triggering quest-related logic. This is part of
    the core NPC interaction mechanics in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who interacted with the
      trainer NPC. Must be a valid player GUID.
  - name: npcGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC trainer that was interacted
      with. Must be a valid NPC GUID.
  - name: trainerEntry
    description: The entry ID of the trainer NPC in the creature_template table. Used
      to identify which specific trainer is being interacted with.
  - name: spells
    description: An integer representing spell data or a flag indicating the spells
      available from the trainer. The exact meaning may depend on internal implementation
      details.
  returns: Returns an NPCEvent object that represents the event of a trainer list
    being received by a player. This object can be used for further processing in
    the game's event handling system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of TrainerListReceived
    code: NPCEvent event = NPCEvent::TrainerListReceived(12345, 67890, 1234, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing trainer list received event
    code: "void HandleTrainerEvent(NPCEvent event) {\n    if (event.GetType() == NPC_EVENT_TRAINER_LIST_RECEIVED)\
      \ {\n        // Process the trainer list\n        uint32 playerGuid = event.GetPlayerGuid();\n\
      \        uint32 npcGuid = event.GetNpcGuid();\n        uint32 trainerEntry =\
      \ event.GetTrainerEntry();\n        int spells = event.GetSpells();\n      \
      \  // Further logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore server when
    a player interacts with a trainer NPC. Developers should ensure that all GUIDs
    passed are valid and correspond to actual entities in the database. The 'spells'
    parameter may require additional decoding depending on how spell data is structured
    within the game's internal systems.
  warnings: Incorrect or invalid GUIDs passed to this method can cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the trainerEntry corresponds to a valid NPC entry in the
    creature_template table, otherwise the event might not be processed correctly
    by the client.
