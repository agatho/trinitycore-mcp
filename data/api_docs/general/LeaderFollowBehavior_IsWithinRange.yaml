  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: IsWithinRange
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsWithinRange(float distance, float min, float
    max)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given distance is within specified minimum and maximum range
    thresholds.
  description: 'The IsWithinRange method evaluates whether a provided distance value
    falls within a defined range, bounded by minimum and maximum values. This functionality
    is commonly used in AI behavior systems to determine if a unit is within acceptable
    proximity to a leader or target. The method performs a simple range check using
    the formula: min <= distance <= max. It''s typically employed in leader-following
    behaviors where units must maintain specific distances from their leader or other
    entities.'
  parameters:
  - name: distance
    description: The distance value to evaluate against the range thresholds. Must
      be a non-negative floating-point number representing the actual distance measurement.
  - name: min
    description: The minimum acceptable distance threshold. Should be a non-negative
      floating-point number that defines the lower bound of the valid range.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum acceptable distance threshold. Must be a non-negative
      floating-point number that defines the upper bound of the valid range. Should
      be greater than or equal to the minimum value.
  returns: Returns true if the distance is within the specified range (inclusive),
    false otherwise. The method returns false when the distance is less than the minimum
    or greater than the maximum.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior.IsWithinRange(10.0f, 5.0f, 15.0f)) {\n    // Distance\
      \ is within range\n    std::cout << \"Unit is within acceptable distance\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Leader-Follower Distance Validation
    code: "float currentDistance = unit->GetDistance(leader);\nif (leaderFollowBehavior.IsWithinRange(currentDistance,\
      \ 2.0f, 8.0f)) {\n    // Continue following\n    unit->MoveTowards(leader, 1.0f);\n\
      } else if (currentDistance < 2.0f) {\n    // Too close, move back\n    unit->MoveAwayFrom(leader,\
      \ 1.0f);\n} else {\n    // Too far, move closer\n    unit->MoveTowards(leader,\
      \ 1.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an inclusive range check, meaning both minimum and maximum
    values are considered valid. The parameters should be carefully validated to ensure
    min <= max for meaningful results. In AI systems, this method is often used in
    conjunction with pathfinding algorithms to maintain proper formation distances.
  warnings: Be cautious when using negative distance values as they may lead to unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the minimum value is not greater than the maximum value
    to avoid incorrect range evaluations. This method does not account for unit size
    or collision detection, only pure distance measurements.
