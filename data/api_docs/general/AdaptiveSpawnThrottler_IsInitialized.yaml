  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the adaptive spawn throttler has been initialized and is ready
    for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler instance
    has completed its initialization process and is fully configured for managing
    spawn rates in the game world. This method is typically used to ensure that the
    throttler's internal state is valid before attempting to query or modify spawn
    behavior. The initialization status is crucial for maintaining proper server performance
    and preventing race conditions during server startup or configuration changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler has been successfully initialized
    and is ready for use; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\nif (throttler.IsInitialized()) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with spawn management operations\n    throttler.AdjustSpawnRate();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle uninitialized state\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"AdaptiveSpawnThrottler\
      \ not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and is generally fast to execute.
    It's recommended to call this method before performing any operations that depend
    on the throttler being properly configured.
