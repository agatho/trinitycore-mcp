  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: IsInEngagementRange
  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::IsInEngagementRange(Player * bot, Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within engagement range of a target unit.
  description: The IsInEngagementRange method checks if the specified player is within
    the defined engagement distance of the given target unit. This functionality is
    typically used in group-based AI logic to determine when a bot should engage or
    disengage from combat with a target. The method evaluates the current distance
    between the player and the target, comparing it against the predefined engagement
    range threshold set for the group or individual bot. It returns true if the target
    is within range and false otherwise. This check is essential for maintaining proper
    group combat behavior and preventing bots from engaging targets that are too far
    away.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is being checked
      for engagement range.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit against which
      the engagement range is evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the player (bot) is within the defined engagement range
    of the target unit, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger->IsInEngagementRange(playerBot, targetUnit)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with attack or engage\n    playerBot->Attack(targetUnit);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer to target\n    playerBot->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in group AI decision making
    code: "Group* group = playerBot->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(playerBot))\
      \ {\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n\
      \         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end(); ++itr)\n    {\n        Player*\
      \ member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n        if (member && member\
      \ != playerBot && !member->IsDead()) {\n            if (groupCombatTrigger->IsInEngagementRange(member,\
      \ targetUnit)) {\n                // Member is in range, continue combat\n \
      \           } else {\n                // Member needs to move closer\n     \
      \           member->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n            }\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the bot's current position and the target's position
    to calculate distance, and compares it against a configurable engagement range
    value. The implementation may consider factors such as line of sight or terrain
    when determining if a unit is truly within engagement range.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent crashes. This method should not be used in high-frequency loops
    without proper optimization, as it involves distance calculations.
