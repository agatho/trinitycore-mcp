  class: SocialEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void SocialEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the social event bus, stopping further event
    notifications.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the
    SocialEventBus, effectively detaching it from receiving any future social events.
    This method is typically used when a bot is being deactivated or destroyed to
    prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions. The operation
    is performed synchronously and ensures that no further callbacks will be issued
    to the unsubscribed subscriber. It's important to note that this method does not
    validate whether the subscriber was previously registered; attempting to unsubscribe
    a non-existent subscriber will typically result in a no-op behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the event
      bus subscription list. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method returns void and does not provide any status or result
    information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... subscribe bot to events ...

      SocialEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(myBot);

      // Bot will no longer receive social events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribe Before Deletion
    code: "void CleanupBot(BotAI* bot)\n{\n    SocialEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(bot);\n\
      \    delete bot;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger event-driven architecture within TrinityCore's
    AI system. The SocialEventBus maintains an internal list of subscribers, and this
    method performs a linear search to remove the specified subscriber. For performance-critical
    applications, consider batching unsubscribe operations or using weak references
    where possible.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always ensure that the BotAI instance exists and has been properly
    subscribed before attempting to unsubscribe it. Additionally, if multiple threads
    are involved in subscription management, proper synchronization should be implemented
    to avoid race conditions.
