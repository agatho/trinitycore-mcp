  method: GetFlags
  signature: int CurrencyTypesEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a currency type entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a specific currency type
    within the TrinityCore framework. These flags are typically used to determine
    how the currency should be handled in-game, such as whether it can be traded,
    awarded through quests, or used in specific contexts like PvP rewards or vendor
    transactions. The returned integer is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to
    a specific flag defined in the game's currency system. This method provides access
    to the underlying configuration data that governs how currencies behave in World
    of Warcraft's economy and progression systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the combined flags for this currency type.
    Each bit in the returned integer corresponds to a specific flag defined in the
    CurrencyFlags enumeration, which may include values such as CURRENCY_FLAG_TRADEABLE,
    CURRENCY_FLAG_QUEST_REWARD, or CURRENCY_FLAG_PVP_REWARD. The exact meaning of
    each bit is determined by the game's internal flag definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a currency is tradeable
    code: "CurrencyTypesEntry const* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & CURRENCY_FLAG_TRADEABLE)\n\
      \    {\n        // Currency can be traded with other players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining currency usage context
    code: "CurrencyTypesEntry const* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(5678);\n\
      int flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & CURRENCY_FLAG_QUEST_REWARD)\n{\n\
      \    // This currency can be awarded as quest reward\n}\nelse if (flags & CURRENCY_FLAG_PVP_REWARD)\n\
      {\n    // This currency is used for PvP rewards\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Default\
      \ behavior or other usage context\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's database
    and configuration files. Developers should be aware that flag values may change
    between different versions of TrinityCore or World of Warcraft patches. The bitmask
    approach allows for efficient storage and checking of multiple properties with
    a single integer value, which is common in game engine design for performance
    reasons.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly manipulating the returned flag values as they
    may be part of a larger system that expects specific combinations of flags. Incorrectly
    setting or clearing bits could lead to unexpected behavior in how currencies are
    handled within the game. Always validate flag combinations against known valid
    sets before making modifications.
