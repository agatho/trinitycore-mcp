  method: OptimizeCacheSize
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::OptimizeCacheSize()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the memory cache size used by the bot system to optimize performance
    and resource usage.
  description: The OptimizeCacheSize method dynamically adjusts the internal memory
    cache settings for the BotMemoryManager class. This method is responsible for
    ensuring that bots utilize an appropriate amount of memory based on current system
    resources and configuration parameters. It typically recalculates optimal cache
    limits, clears unnecessary entries, and may resize internal data structures to
    maintain efficient memory utilization without impacting bot functionality or performance.
    The optimization process considers factors such as active bot count, memory availability,
    and system load to determine the most effective cache size for maintaining responsive
    bot behavior.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->OptimizeCacheSize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or when system resources change
    significantly to maintain optimal bot performance. It may trigger internal cleanup
    operations that could temporarily impact performance during execution.
