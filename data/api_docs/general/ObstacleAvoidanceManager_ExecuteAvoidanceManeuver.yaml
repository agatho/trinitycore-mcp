  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: ExecuteAvoidanceManeuver
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ExecuteAvoidanceManeuver(const AvoidanceManeuver
    & maneuver)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specified avoidance maneuver to prevent collision with obstacles
    in the game world.
  description: The ExecuteAvoidanceManeuver method processes and applies a given AvoidanceManeuver
    to help units navigate around obstacles. This method is typically used by AI-controlled
    creatures or players to dynamically adjust movement paths when encountering environmental
    barriers. It evaluates the maneuver parameters, checks for valid conditions, and
    performs the necessary adjustments to avoid collisions. The method returns true
    if the maneuver was successfully executed, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for realistic NPC behavior and player movement in complex environments.
  parameters:
  - name: maneuver
    description: The AvoidanceManeuver object containing the details of the avoidance
      action to be performed. This includes target positions, movement vectors, and
      other relevant parameters needed to execute the avoidance behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the avoidance maneuver was successfully executed and applied
    to the unit's movement path. Returns false if the maneuver could not be executed
    due to invalid parameters, insufficient resources, or other failure conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Avoidance Maneuver Execution
    code: "AvoidanceManeuver maneuver;\nmaneuver.targetPosition = Position(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 300.0f);\nmaneuver.maneuverType = AvoidanceType::StrafeLeft;\nbool\
      \ success = obstacleAvoidanceManager.ExecuteAvoidanceManeuver(maneuver);\nif\
      \ (success)\n{\n    // Maneuver executed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Avoidance maneuver executed.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Maneuver failed to execute\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to execute avoidance maneuver.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the obstacle avoidance system that helps units navigate
    complex environments. It should be called regularly during movement updates to
    ensure continuous obstacle detection and response. The method may internally perform
    pathfinding calculations and adjust unit movement vectors accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the AvoidanceManeuver object passed to this method contains
    valid data, especially target positions and maneuver types. Invalid parameters
    can lead to failed execution or unexpected behavior in unit movement.
