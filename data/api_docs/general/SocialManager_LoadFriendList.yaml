documentation:
  brief: Loads the friend list for a player from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadFriendList method retrieves all friend entries associated with
    a player from the database and populates the in-memory social list. This method
    is typically called during player login or when the social system needs to be
    initialized. It ensures that the player's friend list is available for immediate
    use without requiring additional database queries during gameplay. The method
    handles loading of friend names, online status, and other relevant social data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    SocialManager::LoadFriendList();\n    //\
      \ Friend list is now loaded and available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the player object has been fully
    initialized and the database connection is active. It performs a single database
    query to fetch all friend entries for the player, which may impact performance
    if a player has a very large number of friends.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate entries in the social list. Ensure that any existing friend data is
    cleared before calling this method to avoid inconsistencies.
