  class: CalendarInvite
  method: SetEventId
  signature: void CalendarInvite::SetEventId(uint64 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the event identifier for this calendar invite.
  description: The SetEventId method assigns a unique event identifier to a calendar
    invite object. This identifier links the invite to a specific calendar event within
    the World of Warcraft game system. The method is typically used during the creation
    or modification of calendar invitations to ensure proper association with the
    intended event. Calendar invites are part of the game's social and scheduling
    functionality, allowing players to organize and manage events such as raids, dungeons,
    or guild activities. This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarInvite
    object by updating its event ID member variable.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the
      calendar event to which this invite belongs. Valid values are positive integers
      that correspond to existing calendar events in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      invite->SetEventId(123456789ULL);

      // The invite is now associated with event ID 123456789'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Event ID During Invite Creation
    code: "void CreateGuildEventInvite(Player* player, uint64 eventId) {\n    CalendarInvite*\
      \ invite = new CalendarInvite();\n    invite->SetEventId(eventId);\n    // Further\
      \ processing of the invite...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment without validation of whether the
    event ID actually exists in the calendar system. It is expected that callers ensure
    the eventId parameter refers to a valid calendar event before invoking this method.
    The CalendarInvite object should be properly initialized before calling SetEventId
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetEventId with an invalid or non-existent event ID may result
    in inconsistent state within the calendar system. Ensure that all event IDs passed
    to this method are verified against existing calendar events. This method does
    not perform any database operations or network calls; it only updates the local
    object's internal state.
