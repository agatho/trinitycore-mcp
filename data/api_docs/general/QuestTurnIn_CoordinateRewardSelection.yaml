api:
  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: CoordinateRewardSelection
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::CoordinateRewardSelection(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates quest reward selection for a group of players upon quest completion.
  description: The CoordinateRewardSelection method handles the distribution and selection
    of quest rewards for players in a group when they complete a specified quest.
    It manages the logic for determining which reward option each player chooses from
    the available rewards, ensuring proper reward assignment based on group dynamics
    and individual player choices. This method is typically invoked after a quest
    is turned in and before rewards are distributed to players.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who completed
      the quest. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which rewards are being coordinated.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Coordination
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questTurnIn->CoordinateRewardSelection(playerGroup, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all players in the group have completed the specified
    quest and are eligible for reward selection. It internally handles group-based
    reward distribution logic including shared rewards and individual choices.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid group can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    The questId must be valid and exist in the game's quest database.
