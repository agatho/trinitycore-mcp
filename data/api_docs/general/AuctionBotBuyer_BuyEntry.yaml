  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: BuyEntry
  signature: void AuctionBotBuyer::BuyEntry(int * auction, int * auctionHouse)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an auction entry for purchase by the Auction Bot buyer system.
  description: The BuyEntry method in the AuctionBotBuyer class handles the logic
    for purchasing items from the auction house. It takes two integer pointers representing
    the auction ID and auction house ID, and performs the necessary operations to
    acquire the item. This method is typically invoked as part of the automated auction
    buying process within TrinityCore's Auction House system. The method likely checks
    item availability, verifies bid amounts, and executes the purchase transaction
    if conditions are met.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the auction
      entry to be purchased.
  - name: auctionHouse
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the auction
      house from which the item is being purchased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int auctionId = 12345;

      int auctionHouseId = 1;

      AuctionBotBuyer buyer;

      buyer.BuyEntry(&auctionId, &auctionHouseId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an automated system that monitors auctions
    and purchases items based on configured criteria. It may involve database operations
    to update auction status and player inventory. The method should be called with
    valid auction and auction house IDs to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the auction ID and auction house ID point to
    valid entries in the database before invoking this method.
