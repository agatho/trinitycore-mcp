  method: GetSkillStartingRankByPos
  signature: uint16 Player::GetSkillStartingRankByPos(uint32 pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the starting rank of a skill at the specified position.
  description: This method retrieves the initial skill rank for a given skill position,
    which is typically used in conjunction with the GetSkillValue() method to determine
    the current skill level. The method returns the starting rank value that was set
    during character creation or when the skill was learned. It's important to note
    that this method does not return the actual skill value but rather the base starting
    rank of the skill at a specific position.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the starting rank value as a uint16, representing the skill's initial
    level before any training or improvement has occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 startingRank = player->GetSkillStartingRankByPos(0);\nuint16 currentSkillValue\
      \ = player->GetSkillValueByPos(0);\n// This would typically be used to determine\
      \ if a skill has been trained\nif (startingRank != currentSkillValue) {\n  \
      \  // Skill has been trained\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for determining the base skill level before
    any training or improvement. It's important to understand that the returned value
    represents the starting rank, not the current skill value. The method may return
    0 if no skill exists at the specified position.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can return 0 if no skill exists
    at the given position. Also note that this method does not account for any skill
    modifiers or training points that may have been applied.
