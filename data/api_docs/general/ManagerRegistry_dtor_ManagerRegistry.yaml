documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ManagerRegistry instance and cleans up all registered managers.
  description: The ~ManagerRegistry destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up and releasing all resources associated with the ManagerRegistry. This includes
    unregistering and destroying any manager objects that were registered with the
    registry. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur and that all subsystems
    are properly shut down before the registry object is destroyed. In the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, this method plays a crucial role in maintaining
    clean shutdown sequences for various game systems that rely on manager registries.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'ManagerRegistry* registry = new ManagerRegistry();

      // ... register managers ...

      delete registry; // Triggers ~ManagerRegistry'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called when a ManagerRegistry object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    objects are still referencing managers from this registry before destruction,
    as dangling references could lead to undefined behavior.
