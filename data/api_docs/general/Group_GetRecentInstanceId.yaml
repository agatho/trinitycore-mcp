  class: Group
  method: GetRecentInstanceId
  signature: int Group::GetRecentInstanceId(int mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the most recently used instance ID for a specified map within the
    group.
  description: The GetRecentInstanceId method returns the instance ID of the most
    recent dungeon or raid instance that the group has entered on the specified map.
    This is typically used to determine which specific instance of a map a group should
    return to, particularly in scenarios involving multiple instances of the same
    map (such as heroic or mythic difficulties). The method does not validate whether
    the instance is still active or accessible; it simply returns the last known instance
    ID associated with that map for this group. This functionality is essential for
    managing group instance tracking and ensuring players are directed to the correct
    instance when re-entering a map.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the most recent instance ID for the specified
    map. If no instance has been recorded for the map, or if the group has not entered
    any instances on that map, the method returns -1.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Recent Instance ID for a Specific Map
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nint instanceId = group->GetRecentInstanceId(1234);\
      \ // Get recent instance ID for map 1234\nif (instanceId != -1)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with logic using the instance ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Recent instance ID\
      \ for map 1234: %d\", instanceId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No recent\
      \ instance found for map 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of group instance data. It is important
    to note that the returned instance ID may not necessarily be valid or accessible
    if the instance has expired or been reset by the server. The method does not perform
    any validation checks on the instance itself.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying that the returned
    instance ID is still valid. Using an invalid instance ID can lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors in group management and instance entry logic.
