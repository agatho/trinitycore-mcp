  class: EvokerAI
  method: GenerateEssence
  signature: void EvokerAI::GenerateEssence(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates essence for the evoker based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateEssence method is responsible for producing essence, a
    resource used by evokers in World of Warcraft. This method typically increases
    the evoker's current essence pool by the provided amount. The essence generated
    can be used to cast spells or abilities that require essence as a resource. The
    behavior may vary depending on the evoker's class specialization and current game
    state, such as whether the evoker is in combat or has specific buffs active.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of essence to generate. Must be a non-negative integer.
      A value of zero will not change the essence pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Generation
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->GenerateEssence(10); // Generates 10 units of essence'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Essence Generation
    code: "EvokerAI* evoker = ...;\nif (evoker->GetHealthPercent() < 50)\n{\n    evoker->GenerateEssence(5);\
      \ // Generate less essence when low on health\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the evoker's internal essence tracking
    system and may trigger visual or auditory feedback in the game client. It is expected
    to be called during AI decision-making cycles, particularly when the evoker needs
    to prepare for spellcasting.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or an error if the implementation does not handle negative inputs gracefully.
    Ensure that the evoker's essence pool does not exceed its maximum capacity after
    generation.
