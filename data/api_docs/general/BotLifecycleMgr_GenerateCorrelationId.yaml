documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique correlation identifier for tracking bot lifecycle events
  description: The GenerateCorrelationId method creates a unique string identifier
    that can be used to track and correlate various lifecycle events associated with
    bot instances within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier is typically used
    for logging, debugging, and monitoring purposes to ensure that related actions
    performed on a bot can be traced back to a common source. The generated ID follows
    a consistent format suitable for integration with existing logging systems and
    telemetry infrastructure. The method does not require any input parameters and
    produces a deterministic yet unique value for each invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the generated correlation identifier, typically
    formatted as a UUID or similar unique string to ensure global uniqueness across
    all bot lifecycle operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance();

      std::string correlationId = mgr->GenerateCorrelationId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot.lifecycle", "Generated correlation ID: {}", correlationId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not produce race conditions
    when called from multiple threads simultaneously. The implementation likely uses
    a combination of timestamp-based components and random elements to ensure uniqueness
    across different invocations.
