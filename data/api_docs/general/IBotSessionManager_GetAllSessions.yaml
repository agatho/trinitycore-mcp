  method: GetAllSessions
  signature: int IBotSessionManager::GetAllSessions() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of active bot sessions managed by the session manager.
  description: The GetAllSessions method returns an integer representing the number
    of currently active bot sessions within the system. This method is typically used
    for monitoring, debugging, or administrative purposes to determine how many bots
    are currently connected and operational. The returned value reflects the current
    state of the session manager's internal tracking mechanism and may be used in
    conjunction with other session management APIs to provide a complete overview
    of bot activity. No parameters are required for this operation, and it performs
    a read-only query on the session inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of active bot sessions currently
    managed by the IBotSessionManager instance. A return value of zero indicates no
    active sessions, while positive integers represent the count of active sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Sessions
    code: "int sessionCount = sessionManager->GetAllSessions();\nif (sessionCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Active bot sessions: \" << sessionCount << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"No active bot sessions found.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant operation and does not modify any internal state.
    It should be efficient for frequent calls but may involve locking mechanisms depending
    on the implementation. The returned count includes all sessions regardless of
    their specific type or status (e.g., idle, active, paused).
  warnings: While this method provides a quick overview of session counts, it does
    not provide detailed information about individual sessions. If session details
    are needed, additional methods such as GetSessionById() or IterateSessions() should
    be used in conjunction with this method.
