  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: AnalyzeLearningProgression
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeLearningProgression(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the learning progression of a bot identified by its GUID within
    the AI decision profiling system.
  description: The AnalyzeLearningProgression method evaluates how a specific bot,
    identified by its unique Game Object ID (GUID), has progressed through various
    learning stages or decision-making patterns over time. This function is typically
    used in the context of TrinityCore's AI framework to monitor and assess the development
    of bot behavior, particularly in scenarios involving adaptive learning or skill
    acquisition. It may collect data on decision frequency, success rates, and pattern
    evolution to inform further AI tuning or behavioral adjustments. The method operates
    on a per-bot basis and requires that the bot exists within the active AI system
    for meaningful analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose learning progression
      is to be analyzed. This value must correspond to an existing GameObject in the
      world, typically a player-controlled NPC or AI entity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      profiler.AnalyzeLearningProgression(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified bot GUID is valid and corresponds
    to an active AI entity within the TrinityCore environment. It may perform internal
    data collection or logging operations, so performance impact should be considered
    in high-frequency usage scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid refers to a valid GameObject; otherwise,
    the behavior of this method is undefined. Calling this function on bots not managed
    by the AI decision profiler may result in no-op or error conditions.
