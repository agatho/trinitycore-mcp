  signature: void DungeonBehavior::PullTrashGroup(Group * group, const int & trashMobs)
documentation:
  brief: Pulls a group of trash mobs for dungeon combat
  description: The PullTrashGroup method is responsible for initiating the spawning
    and engagement of a specified group of trash mobs within a dungeon environment.
    This method typically handles the logic required to bring enemy units into combat
    with the player party, managing their positioning, aggro behavior, and initial
    combat state. It's commonly used in dungeon AI systems to control the flow of
    encounters and ensure proper mob engagement during scripted events or dynamic
    combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the trash mobs to be pulled
      into combat. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid group
      of creatures that are properly configured for dungeon encounters.
  - name: trashMobs
    description: Integer value representing the number of trash mobs in the group
      to pull. This parameter determines how many of the specified group members will
      be activated for combat engagement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Group* trashGroup = new Group();

      // ... populate trashGroup with mobs ...

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.PullTrashGroup(trashGroup, 5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic group management
    code: "if (player->GetGroup() && player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n\
      {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    int mobCount = group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ * 2; // Pull twice the number of players\n    dungeonBehavior.PullTrashGroup(group,\
      \ mobCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the dungeon's AI system to properly initialize
    mob behavior and positioning. It may trigger additional events or callbacks related
    to combat start conditions. The method assumes that the Group object has already
    been properly initialized with valid creature references.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group parameter contains valid mob references before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid or uninitialized group could result in undefined
    behavior. This method should only be called during appropriate dungeon encounter
    phases to avoid disrupting game flow or causing client-side issues.
