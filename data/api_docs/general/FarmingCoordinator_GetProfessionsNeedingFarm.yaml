  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetProfessionsNeedingFarm
  signature: int FarmingCoordinator::GetProfessionsNeedingFarm(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of professions requiring farming activities for the
    specified player.
  description: The GetProfessionsNeedingFarm method determines how many professions
    associated with a given player require farming-related actions or resources. This
    typically applies to players who have professions such as Herbalism, Mining, or
    other skills that depend on farming or gathering materials from the environment.
    The method takes a pointer to a player object and returns an integer count representing
    the number of such professions. It is commonly used in TrinityCore's farming and
    resource management systems to determine which professions need attention or updates
    based on current farm status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to check professions requiring
      farming activities. Must not be null.
  returns: An integer representing the number of professions that require farming
    actions or resources for the specified player. Returns 0 if no such professions
    exist, or a positive integer if one or more professions are found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nint professionCount\
      \ = coordinator.GetProfessionsNeedingFarm(player);\nif (professionCount > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Handle professions requiring farming\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Farming Logic
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nint neededFarms = coordinator.GetProfessionsNeedingFarm(player);\n\
      if (neededFarms > 0) {\n    // Trigger farming update logic\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      world\", \"Player {} has {} professions requiring farm updates.\", player->GetName(),\
      \ neededFarms);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. The internal implementation likely iterates through the player's
    active professions to determine if any are related to farming or gathering activities.
    Performance may be impacted when dealing with players who have many active professions.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    should only be called during valid gameplay states where player data is fully
    loaded and accessible.
