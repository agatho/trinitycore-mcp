  method: GetLevelForTarget
  signature: uint8 WorldObject::GetLevelForTarget(const WorldObject * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the effective level of this WorldObject as it should be displayed
    to the specified target.
  description: The GetLevelForTarget method calculates and returns the level that
    should be shown for this WorldObject when viewed by a specific target. This is
    particularly important in World of Warcraft's context where creatures may display
    different levels to players based on level differences, player progression, or
    game mechanics such as level scaling. The returned value represents the adjusted
    level that accounts for these factors and ensures proper visual feedback to the
    user interface. This method typically considers the relationship between the object
    and its target, including whether the target is a player, and adjusts the displayed
    level accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the effective level of this WorldObject as it
    should be displayed for the target. The value is typically within the normal level
    range (1-255) but may be adjusted based on game mechanics such as level scaling
    or player-target relationship.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get level for a player target
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint8 displayLevel = creature->GetLevelForTarget(player);

      // Use displayLevel in UI or combat calculations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a packet send operation
    code: 'WorldPacket data(SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT, 100);

      ObjectGuid guid = unit->GetGUID();

      data << uint8(1); // number of updates

      data << guid;

      data << uint8(UPDATE_TYPE_VALUES);

      uint8 level = unit->GetLevelForTarget(targetPlayer);

      data << uint8(level); // Send adjusted level to client'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used when sending object updates to clients, especially
    for creatures and players. It's important to note that the returned level may
    differ from the actual internal level of the object due to game mechanics like
    level scaling or player progression systems. The implementation likely takes into
    account the target's own level and the difference between it and the WorldObject's
    base level.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining combat effectiveness or
    actual stat calculations, as it only returns the display level. For accurate level-based
    computations, use the object's internal level methods instead.
