api:
  class: Guild
  method: _GetRankBankTabRights
  signature: int8 Guild::_GetRankBankTabRights(GuildRankId rankId, uint8 tabId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bank tab rights for a specified guild rank.
  description: The _GetRankBankTabRights method retrieves the permission level associated
    with a specific guild rank for accessing a particular bank tab. This method is
    used internally by the Guild class to determine what actions a rank can perform
    on a given bank tab, such as viewing, depositing, or withdrawing items. The returned
    value represents the rights bitmask that defines the permissions for the specified
    rank and tab combination. This functionality is essential for maintaining guild
    bank security and access control within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: rankId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild rank for which to retrieve bank
      tab rights.
  - name: tabId
    description: The index of the bank tab for which to retrieve rank permissions
      (0-based).
  returns: Returns an int8 value representing the bank tab rights bitmask for the
    specified rank and tab. The exact meaning of bits in this mask depends on internal
    implementation but typically includes flags for viewing, depositing, and withdrawing
    permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bank tab rights for a specific rank
    code: "int8 rights = guild->_GetRankBankTabRights(GUILD_RANK_OFFICER, 0);\nif\
      \ (rights & BANK_TAB_RIGHT_VIEW)\n{\n    // Rank has view permission\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from external
    code. The method likely accesses internal data structures that store guild rank
    permissions for bank tabs. It's part of the core guild management system in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of rankId or tabId may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory access violations. Always ensure these parameters
    are within valid ranges before calling.
