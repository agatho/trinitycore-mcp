  method: AddTarget
  signature: void MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::AddTarget(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a target GUID to the Mistweaver Renewing Mist tracker for tracking healing
    effects.
  description: The AddTarget method registers a new target GUID within the Mistweaver
    Renewing Mist tracker. This functionality is used to monitor which targets are
    currently affected by the Renewing Mist ability, allowing the system to properly
    manage healing application and duration tracking. The method likely stores the
    GUID in an internal collection or data structure for later reference during healing
    calculations and effect updates. This method is typically called when a player
    applies the Renewing Mist buff to a target, ensuring that the tracker maintains
    accurate records of all active targets.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to be added to the
      tracker. This should be a valid GameObject or Unit GUID from the TrinityCore
      world system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MistweaverReNewingMistTracker tracker;

      tracker.AddTarget(12345); // Adds player with GUID 12345 to the tracker'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation on the provided GUID to ensure
    it refers to a valid unit or game object before adding it to the tracking list.
    The implementation may also include checks to prevent duplicate entries for the
    same target.
