  class: BotProfiler
  method: CalculateCorrelation
  signature: double BotProfiler::CalculateCorrelation(const int & x, const int & y)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the correlation coefficient between two integer datasets used
    for bot behavior analysis.
  description: The CalculateCorrelation method computes the Pearson correlation coefficient
    between two sets of integer data points. This statistical measure indicates how
    strongly two variables are linearly related, with values ranging from -1 (perfect
    negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation). In the context of
    TrinityCore's bot system, this method is typically used to analyze relationships
    between different bot performance metrics or behavioral patterns. The method requires
    valid input data and will return a double precision floating-point value representing
    the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two datasets.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: First dataset represented as an integer value used in correlation
      calculation
  - name: y
    description: Second dataset represented as an integer value used in correlation
      calculation
  returns: A double precision floating-point number representing the Pearson correlation
    coefficient between the two input datasets. Values range from -1.0 (perfect negative
    correlation) to +1.0 (perfect positive correlation). A value near 0 indicates
    no linear correlation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Correlation Calculation
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      int dataX = 5;

      int dataY = 10;

      double correlation = profiler.CalculateCorrelation(dataX, dataY);

      // Returns correlation value between -1.0 and 1.0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot profiling system designed to analyze player
    behavior patterns in World of Warcraft. The implementation likely uses statistical
    algorithms to compute correlation coefficients from historical bot performance
    data. Performance considerations should be noted when processing large datasets,
    as correlation calculations can become computationally intensive with many data
    points.
  warnings: The method may produce unexpected results if the input datasets contain
    insufficient or invalid data points. Ensure that both x and y parameters represent
    meaningful numerical values for accurate correlation analysis. Edge cases such
    as division by zero during calculation are not explicitly handled in this method
    signature.
