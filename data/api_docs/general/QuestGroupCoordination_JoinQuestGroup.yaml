  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: JoinQuestGroup
  signature: bool QuestGroupCoordination::JoinQuestGroup(Player * player, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to add a player to a quest group for coordinated quest participation.
  description: The JoinQuestGroup method is responsible for adding a Player to a quest
    group, enabling coordinated quest completion. This functionality allows multiple
    players to work together on the same quest, sharing progress and rewards. The
    method typically checks if the player can join the specified quest group based
    on quest requirements, group limits, and player state. It ensures that quest groups
    are properly managed to maintain game balance and prevent exploits related to
    quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object attempting to join the quest group.
      Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the player is attempting
      to join a group. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the quest group, false
    otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid player state, quest not being part
    of a group, or exceeding group limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Group Join
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      bool success = sQuestGroupCoordination->JoinQuestGroup(player, questId);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    // Player successfully joined the quest group\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_QUEST_GROUP_JOINED,\
      \ player->GetName(), questId);\n} else {\n    // Failed to join quest group\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(LANG_QUEST_GROUP_JOIN_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with a quest giver
    or quest item that enables group participation. The implementation may involve
    checking for existing group membership, validating quest eligibility, and updating
    internal quest group data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent crashes. Also, verify that the questId corresponds to an actual quest
    in the database to avoid unexpected behavior.
