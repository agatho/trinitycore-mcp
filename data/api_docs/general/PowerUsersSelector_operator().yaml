documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a target unit meets the criteria for power user selection
    in AI behavior.
  description: The PowerUsersSelector::operator() method is a predicate function used
    within TrinityCore's AI system to determine if a given Unit object qualifies as
    a valid target for specific power-based actions or behaviors. This method typically
    checks various conditions such as the unit's faction, health status, power type,
    and other relevant attributes to decide whether it should be considered in AI
    decision-making processes. The method is commonly used in conjunction with STL
    algorithms like std::find_if or similar container filtering operations to identify
    suitable targets from a list of potential candidates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit meets all criteria for power user selection,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the unit is considered
    a valid candidate for power-based AI behaviors, while false means it does not
    meet the required conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Target Selection
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> targets;\n// ... populate targets with units\nPowerUsersSelector\
      \ selector;\nauto it = std::find_if(targets.begin(), targets.end(), selector);\n\
      if (it != targets.end()) {\n    // Process the selected target\n    Unit* selectedTarget\
      \ = *it;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI contexts where specific units need to
    be filtered based on their power attributes. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific subclass or context in which PowerUsersSelector is utilized, but
    generally involves checking for valid power types and appropriate unit states.
