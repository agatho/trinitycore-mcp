  method: DoesLineIntersectCircle
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::DoesLineIntersectCircle(const int & lineStart, const
    int & lineEnd, const int & center, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a line segment intersects with a circular obstacle.
  description: The DoesLineIntersectCircle method checks if a straight line segment
    defined by two points (lineStart and lineEnd) intersects with a circle centered
    at a given point with a specified radius. This utility is commonly used in pathfinding,
    line-of-sight calculations, and collision detection within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method performs geometric calculations to determine intersection without requiring
    explicit point coordinates, instead using integer identifiers that likely represent
    positions or nodes in a navigation mesh or grid system.
  parameters:
  - name: lineStart
    description: Integer identifier representing the starting point of the line segment.
      This typically corresponds to a node or position in a navigation mesh.
  - name: lineEnd
    description: Integer identifier representing the ending point of the line segment.
      This typically corresponds to a node or position in a navigation mesh.
  - name: center
    description: Integer identifier representing the center point of the circular
      obstacle. This typically corresponds to a node or position in a navigation mesh.
  - name: radius
    description: Floating-point value specifying the radius of the circular obstacle
      in world units. Must be positive and greater than zero.
  returns: Returns true if the line segment intersects with the circle, false otherwise.
    The method considers the line segment as a finite line between lineStart and lineEnd,
    not an infinite ray.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line-Circle Intersection Check
    code: 'bool intersects = ObstacleUtils::DoesLineIntersectCircle(1001, 1005, 2000,
      3.0f);

      // Checks if a line from node 1001 to 1005 intersects with a circle centered
      at node 2000 with radius 3.0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding Obstacle Detection
    code: "if (!ObstacleUtils::DoesLineIntersectCircle(playerNode, targetNode, obstacleCenter,\
      \ obstacleRadius))\n{\n    // Safe path - no intersection with obstacle\n  \
      \  MovePlayerToTarget();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Path blocked - find alternative\
      \ route\n    FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for performance in high-frequency pathfinding
    scenarios. It assumes that the integer identifiers map to valid positions in a
    navigation mesh or grid system. The implementation may use vector mathematics
    and geometric algorithms such as distance-from-point-to-line calculations to determine
    intersection.
  warnings: Ensure that all node identifiers (lineStart, lineEnd, center) are valid
    and correspond to actual positions in your navigation system. Invalid identifiers
    could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. The method treats the line
    segment as finite, so it won't detect intersections with infinite lines extending
    beyond the defined endpoints.
