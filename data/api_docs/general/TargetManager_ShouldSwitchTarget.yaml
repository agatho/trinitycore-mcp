  class: TargetManager
  method: ShouldSwitchTarget
  signature: bool TargetManager::ShouldSwitchTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should switch to a different target based on current
    threat and target priority.
  description: The ShouldSwitchTarget method evaluates the current target against
    potential alternative targets within the AI's threat list. It considers factors
    such as threat level, target validity, and target priority to decide if switching
    is beneficial for the AI's behavior. This method is typically called during AI
    update cycles to ensure optimal targeting decisions are made. The method returns
    true when a better target is available and should be selected, or false when the
    current target remains the most suitable option.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should switch targets based on threat evaluation
    and priority checks; otherwise returns false if the current target is still optimal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_targetManager && m_targetManager->ShouldSwitchTarget())\n\
      \    {\n        // Switch to a better target\n        if (Unit* newTarget =\
      \ m_targetManager->GetNextTarget())\n            AttackStart(newTarget);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI targeting system and relies on the internal
    threat table maintained by the TargetManager. It should be called regularly during
    AI update cycles to ensure responsive target switching behavior.
