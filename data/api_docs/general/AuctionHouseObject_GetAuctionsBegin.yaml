documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns the starting index for iterating through the auction
    house's auctions list.
  description: The GetAuctionsBegin method serves as a utility function to retrieve
    the initial position or starting index within the internal data structure that
    holds all active auctions in the auction house. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other auction iteration methods to traverse the list of available
    auctions. It ensures that any subsequent calls to fetch auction data begin from
    the correct offset, maintaining consistency in how auction listings are accessed
    and displayed to players. The returned value represents an integer index that
    can be used for sequential access to auction entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the starting index (typically zero) from which
    auctions should be iterated. This value is usually used as a base offset for accessing
    auction data structures internally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Auction Iterator
    code: "AuctionHouseObject* ah = ...;\nint startIndex = ah->GetAuctionsBegin();\n\
      // Use startIndex to begin iterating through auctions\nfor (int i = startIndex;\
      \ i < ah->GetAuctionCount(); ++i)\n{\n    AuctionEntry* auction = ah->GetAuction(i);\n\
      \    // Process each auction entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation or modification of auction data.
    It simply returns a constant value indicating the beginning of the auction list.
    The actual implementation may vary depending on internal data structure design,
    but it's expected to return a consistent starting point for iteration.
