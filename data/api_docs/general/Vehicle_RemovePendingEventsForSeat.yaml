  class: Vehicle
  method: RemovePendingEventsForSeat
  signature: void Vehicle::RemovePendingEventsForSeat(int8 seatId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all pending events associated with a specific seat on the vehicle.
  description: The RemovePendingEventsForSeat method clears any queued or scheduled
    events that are designated for a particular seat within the vehicle. This is typically
    used during vehicle transitions, dismounting, or when cleaning up event handlers
    to prevent stale or invalid events from executing. The method operates on the
    internal event queue of the vehicle and ensures that no pending actions remain
    for the specified seat, which helps maintain synchronization between the game
    state and the vehicle's behavior. It does not affect active or ongoing events
    but only those that are queued for future execution.
  parameters:
  - name: seatId
    description: The identifier of the seat for which pending events should be removed.
      This value corresponds to a specific seat index within the vehicle's seat configuration,
      typically ranging from 0 to the maximum number of seats defined for that vehicle
      type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove pending events for a specific seat during dismount
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->RemovePendingEventsForSeat(0);\
      \ // Remove events for the first seat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage event scheduling and cleanup during vehicle operations. It should be called
    before performing actions that might alter or invalidate the state of a seat,
    such as changing passenger assignments or initiating dismount sequences.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided seatId is valid and within the bounds of the
    vehicle's defined seats; passing an invalid seat ID may result in undefined behavior
    or silent failures. This method does not validate the seat ID, so callers must
    ensure correctness.
