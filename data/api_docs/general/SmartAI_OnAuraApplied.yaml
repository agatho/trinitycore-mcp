  signature: void SmartAI::OnAuraApplied(const int * aurApp)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an aura is applied to the SmartAI unit
  description: The OnAuraApplied method is a virtual callback function in the SmartAI
    class that is invoked whenever an aura (buff or debuff) is successfully applied
    to the AI-controlled unit. This method allows custom behavior to be defined when
    specific auras are applied, such as triggering events, modifying unit state, or
    initiating combat actions. It serves as part of the AI's event-driven system and
    can be overridden in custom AI implementations to provide specialized logic for
    aura application handling.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the aura application data or ID.
      This parameter typically contains information about which aura was applied,
      its source, and other relevant context for the application event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public SmartAI {\npublic:\n    void OnAuraApplied(const\
      \ int* aurApp) override {\n        // Custom logic when aura is applied\n  \
      \      if (aurApp && *aurApp == 12345) { // Example aura ID\n            //\
      \ Trigger special behavior\n            DoSomethingSpecial();\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Aura Application with Combat Response
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnAuraApplied(const int* aurApp) {\n    if (!aurApp) return;\n\
      \    \n    switch (*aurApp) {\n        case 1001: // Poison aura\n         \
      \   me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n            break;\n        case 1002:\
      \ // Healing aura\n            DoCast(SPELL_HEALING_AURA);\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI's event system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. The parameter 'aurApp' may contain different types
    of data depending on how it's populated by the core engine, so developers should
    verify its contents before using it. Ensure that any modifications to the unit
    state or spell casting within this method do not cause infinite loops or unintended
    side effects.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls inside this method
    as it may impact AI responsiveness and overall server performance. Be cautious
    when modifying the unit's state directly from this callback, as it might interfere
    with other systems relying on aura application events.
