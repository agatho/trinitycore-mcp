  method: GetEnchantRequiredLevel
  signature: uint32 Item::GetEnchantRequiredLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required level for enchanting an item.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum character level required to enchant
    a specific item. The returned value represents the level at which the item can
    be enchanted, typically corresponding to the enchant's requirements. This is useful
    for determining whether a player has sufficient level to apply enchantments to
    items, particularly in scenarios where items may have different enchantment requirements
    based on their quality or type. The method does not consider the actual enchantment
    applied, but rather the required level for the enchantment itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the required level for enchanting this item, typically ranging
    from 1 to 255 depending on the item's properties and enchantment requirements.
    This value represents the minimum character level needed to apply an enchantment
    to the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 requiredLevel = item->GetEnchantRequiredLevel();\nif (requiredLevel\
      \ <= player->GetLevel()) {\n    // Player can enchant the item\n} else {\n \
      \   // Player cannot enchant the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine whether a player's level meets the requirements for enchanting. It
    may be affected by item quality and type, and should be considered when implementing
    enchantment systems.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not account for any additional enchantment
    requirements beyond the basic required level. Some items may have special conditions
    or restrictions that could affect enchantment applicability.
