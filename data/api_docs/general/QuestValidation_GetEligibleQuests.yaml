api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetEligibleQuests
  signature: int QuestValidation::GetEligibleQuests(Player * bot, const int & candidates)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of eligible quests available for a player character based
    on specified criteria.
  description: The GetEligibleQuests method evaluates and returns the number of quests
    that are currently available and eligible for a given player character. This function
    likely checks various conditions such as quest level requirements, previous completion
    status, faction alignment, and other game-specific constraints to determine eligibility.
    The method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots to
    identify which quests can be accepted or pursued by the player. It serves as a
    core utility for quest management logic within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      eligible quests are being evaluated.
  - name: candidates
    description: Reference to an integer value that likely represents a bitmask or
      filter criteria used to narrow down eligible quest candidates.
  returns: An integer representing the total count of quests that meet all eligibility
    requirements for the specified player. Returns zero if no eligible quests are
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nint candidateFilter\
      \ = 0x01; // Example filter bitmask\nint eligibleCount = QuestValidation::GetEligibleQuests(player,\
      \ candidateFilter);\nif (eligibleCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest selection\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Filters
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint filterFlags = 0x01 | 0x02; // Combine multiple\
      \ eligibility flags\nint count = QuestValidation::GetEligibleQuests(player,\
      \ filterFlags);\nfor (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n{\n    // Iterate through\
      \ eligible quests and process them\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries or cached data lookups depending
    on how the QuestValidation system is implemented. Performance can be affected
    by the number of active quests in the game world and the complexity of eligibility
    checks. The 'candidates' parameter might be used to filter quests by type, faction,
    or other criteria.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as accessing an invalid player object could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Also, be aware that quest eligibility may change dynamically based
    on game state, so results should not be cached for extended periods without re-evaluation.
