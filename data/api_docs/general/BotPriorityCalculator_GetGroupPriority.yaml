  class: BotPriorityCalculator
  method: GetGroupPriority
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityCalculator::GetGroupPriority(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a bot group based on configured
    criteria.
  description: The GetGroupPriority method computes a numerical priority value for
    a given bot group. This priority is typically used by the TrinityCore AI system
    to determine which bot groups should be prioritized for certain actions, such
    as quest completion, resource gathering, or combat engagement. The calculation
    may consider factors like group size, player levels, available resources, or other
    configurable settings within the bot system. The method accepts a pointer to an
    integer representing the bot identifier and returns a uint32 value indicating
    the calculated priority.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer that identifies the specific bot within the
      group. This parameter is used to retrieve or calculate the group's priority
      based on the bot's properties or state.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated priority of the bot group. Higher
    values typically indicate higher priority, though exact interpretation depends
    on how the system uses this value for decision-making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nuint32 priority = calculator.GetGroupPriority(&botId);\n\
      // Use priority to determine next action\nif (priority > 1000)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ high-priority task\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    uint32 CalculateGroupPriority(int botId)\n\
      \    {\n        return priorityCalculator.GetGroupPriority(&botId);\n    }\n\
      };\n\n// Usage in bot management logic\nBotManager manager;\nuint32 groupPriority\
      \ = manager.CalculateGroupPriority(54321);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot AI framework and may rely on internal
    state tracking or configuration settings. Ensure that the bot identifier passed
    to this method is valid and corresponds to an existing bot in the system. The
    priority calculation logic may be subject to change based on game updates or custom
    configurations.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer for the 'bot' parameter could
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the bot identifier
    exists before calling this method.
