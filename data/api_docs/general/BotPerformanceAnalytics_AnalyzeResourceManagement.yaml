  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeResourceManagement
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeResourceManagement(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotPerformanceProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes resource management performance for a specified bot and updates
    its profile with calculated metrics.
  description: The AnalyzeResourceManagement method evaluates how efficiently a bot
    manages its in-game resources such as mana, health, and item usage. It processes
    the bot's behavior patterns and calculates key performance indicators related
    to resource allocation and consumption. This method is typically invoked during
    performance profiling or when generating detailed analytics reports for bot optimization.
    The method modifies the provided BotPerformanceProfile object directly, updating
    it with new metrics that reflect the bot's resource management efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose resource management is
      being analyzed. Must correspond to a valid active bot in the system.
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to a BotPerformanceProfile object that will be updated
      with resource management analysis results. The profile must already exist and
      contain valid baseline data for accurate comparison.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Management Analysis
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      // Assume profile is initialized with baseline data

      analytics.AnalyzeResourceManagement(botGuid, profile);

      // Profile now contains updated resource management metrics'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Reporting System
    code: "void ReportBotPerformance(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    BotPerformanceProfile\
      \ profile;\n    // Initialize profile with current state\n    analytics.AnalyzeResourceManagement(botGuid,\
      \ profile);\n    // Generate report based on updated profile\n    GenerateResourceReport(profile);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is currently active and has sufficient data
    for analysis. The performance profile should be initialized before calling this
    method to ensure accurate comparison metrics are generated.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure proper validation of bot status
    before execution.
