  signature: bool GatheringManager::IsGathering() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently engaged in a gathering activity such as
    mining, herbalism, or skinning.
  description: The IsGathering method determines whether the player character is currently
    performing a gathering skill, which includes activities like mining ore, herbalism
    for herbs, skinning beasts, and other similar resource collection actions. This
    method returns true if the player's current action state indicates an active gathering
    process, and false otherwise. The check is typically used to prevent certain actions
    while a player is gathering resources or to provide feedback about the player's
    current activity state in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently engaged in a gathering activity;
    returns false if the player is not performing any gathering action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check gathering status
    code: "if (player->GetGatheringManager()->IsGathering()) {\n    // Player is currently\
      \ gathering\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are currently gathering resources.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is not gathering\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are\
      \ not currently gathering.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing actions during gathering
    code: "if (!player->GetGatheringManager()->IsGathering()) {\n    // Allow the\
      \ player to initiate a new gathering action\n    StartGatheringSkill(skillType);\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent starting a new gathering while already gathering\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You are already gathering.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the player's current
    action. It may not reflect real-time changes immediately if the player's action
    state is updated asynchronously. The implementation typically checks for active
    spell effects or action states related to gathering skills.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical gameplay logic without
    also considering other factors such as cooldowns, resource availability, and player
    permissions. The gathering state may not be updated instantly in all scenarios.
