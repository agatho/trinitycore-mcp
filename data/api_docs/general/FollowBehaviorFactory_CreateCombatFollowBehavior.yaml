documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new combat follow behavior instance for AI-controlled
    units
  description: The CreateCombatFollowBehavior method is responsible for instantiating
    a new combat follow behavior object within the TrinityCore AI system. This behavior
    allows NPC units to follow a designated target while maintaining combat readiness,
    typically used in scenarios where mobs need to pursue enemies while keeping their
    attack capabilities active. The method initializes the necessary internal state
    and configuration required for the follow behavior to function correctly within
    the game's AI framework. It returns an identifier that can be used to reference
    or manage the created behavior instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer identifier representing the newly created combat follow behavior
    instance. A positive value typically indicates successful creation, while negative
    values may represent errors or invalid states during instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int behaviorId = factory->CreateCombatFollowBehavior();\nif (behaviorId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Successfully created behavior\n    // Use behaviorId to manage\
      \ the follow behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior factory system and should only be
    called when initializing or modifying NPC AI behavior configurations. The returned
    identifier must be properly tracked to avoid memory leaks or invalid references.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper AI context may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the calling code has appropriate access to the AI subsystem
    before invoking this method.
