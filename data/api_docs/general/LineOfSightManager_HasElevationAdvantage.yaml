  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: HasElevationAdvantage
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::HasElevationAdvantage(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit has elevation advantage over a target unit for
    line of sight calculations.
  description: The HasElevationAdvantage method evaluates if the calling unit possesses
    a height or elevation benefit relative to the specified target unit when determining
    line of sight. This is crucial in World of Warcraft's combat mechanics, particularly
    for determining whether an attacker can see and attack a target, or if environmental
    elevation blocks visibility. The method likely considers factors such as terrain
    height differences, object bounding boxes, and unit collision models. It returns
    true if the unit's position provides sufficient elevation to overcome potential
    blocking obstacles between the two units, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has elevation advantage over the target unit for
    line of sight purposes; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->HasElevationAdvantage(targetUnit))\
      \ {\n    // Player can see and attack target due to elevation\n    player->Attack(targetUnit,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "if (npc->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->HasElevationAdvantage(player)) {\n\
      \    // NPC can see player and initiate attack\n    npc->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \    npc->Attack(player, true);\n} else {\n    // NPC cannot see player due\
      \ to elevation disadvantage\n    npc->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LineOfSightManager class which handles complex
    visibility calculations in TrinityCore. The implementation likely uses bounding
    box checks, height comparisons, and potentially raycasting techniques to determine
    elevation advantage. It may be called frequently during combat updates and should
    be optimized for performance.
  warnings: Ensure that both the calling unit and target are valid and exist before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers could lead to undefined behavior. The
    method's accuracy depends on proper positioning data and collision models being
    set up correctly in the game world.
