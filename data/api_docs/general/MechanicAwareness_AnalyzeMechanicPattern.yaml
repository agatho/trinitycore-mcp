  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: AnalyzeMechanicPattern
  signature: float MechanicAwareness::AnalyzeMechanicPattern(Unit * target, MechanicType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns a float value representing the mechanic awareness pattern
    for a given unit and mechanic type.
  description: The AnalyzeMechanicPattern method evaluates how a target unit responds
    to a specific mechanic type, returning a float value that represents the strength
    or likelihood of the unit's awareness or resistance to that mechanic. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine how units react to various
    game mechanics such as stuns, roots, silences, and other debuffs. The returned
    value can be used to influence decision-making processes in NPC AI, spell targeting,
    or combat strategy. The method requires a valid Unit pointer and a valid MechanicType
    enum value to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose mechanic awareness pattern is being
      analyzed. Must be a valid pointer to an existing unit in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The MechanicType enum value representing the specific mechanic to
      analyze. This defines what type of game mechanic (e.g., stun, root, silence)
      the awareness pattern is being evaluated for.
  returns: A float value representing the mechanic awareness pattern. Higher values
    typically indicate stronger resistance or awareness to the specified mechanic,
    while lower values suggest susceptibility or lack of awareness. The exact interpretation
    may vary based on implementation details and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float awareness = awarenessSystem.AnalyzeMechanicPattern(targetUnit, MECHANIC_STUN);
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making Based on Awareness
    code: "if (awarenessSystem.AnalyzeMechanicPattern(enemy, MECHANIC_ROOT) > 0.7f)\n\
      {\n    // Avoid applying root mechanics\n    ai->ChooseAlternativeStrategy();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in the context of AI decision-making and combat
    analysis systems within TrinityCore. The returned float value should be interpreted
    within the context of the specific game mechanics being analyzed. Performance
    may be impacted when called frequently on many units, so caching results where
    appropriate is recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that the target Unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The MechanicType parameter must be a valid enum value;
    invalid values may lead to unexpected results or crashes. Be aware that the interpretation
    of return values might vary depending on specific implementation details in different
    TrinityCore versions.
