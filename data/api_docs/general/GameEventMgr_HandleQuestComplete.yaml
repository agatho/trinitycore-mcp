  method: HandleQuestComplete
  signature: void GameEventMgr::HandleQuestComplete(uint32 quest_id)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the completion of a quest within the game event system, triggering
    associated event behaviors and updates.
  description: The HandleQuestComplete method in the GameEventMgr class is responsible
    for managing the completion of a specific quest within the context of active game
    events. When invoked, it evaluates whether the completed quest is part of any
    ongoing game events and triggers appropriate event-related actions such as updating
    event states, rewarding players, or modifying in-game conditions. This method
    ensures that quest completions are properly integrated with the broader game event
    framework, maintaining synchronization between player progress and event mechanics.
    The method does not return any value but may influence various internal systems
    depending on the active events and quest configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that has been completed. This
      ID must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database, and it determines
      which event-specific behaviors are triggered during processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Handling
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->HandleQuestComplete(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestComplete(uint32 questId)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    sGameEventMgr->HandleQuestComplete(questId);\n    // ... rest of\
      \ completion logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game systems when
    a player completes a quest. It assumes that the quest_id passed is valid and registered
    within the game's event system. The implementation may involve database lookups
    or event state checks, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent quest_id may lead
    to undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that all quest IDs are validated
    before invoking this method. Additionally, calling this method outside of the
    proper game event context might cause inconsistencies in event state management.
