  method: Detect
  signature: ExecutionContext ExecutionContext::Detect()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new ExecutionContext instance configured for detection
    operations.
  description: The Detect method is a static factory function that initializes and
    returns a new ExecutionContext object specifically designed for performing detection-related
    tasks within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically sets up default
    configurations, initializes internal state variables, and prepares the execution
    context for detection logic such as area-of-effect checks, line-of-sight calculations,
    or target scanning operations. The returned ExecutionContext can then be used
    with other detection methods in the system to perform various game mechanics related
    to visibility, targeting, or environmental awareness.
  parameters: []
  returns: A new instance of ExecutionContext configured for detection operations.
    This object contains all necessary state and configuration required to execute
    detection algorithms within the TrinityCore environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ExecutionContext context = ExecutionContext::Detect();\n// Use context\
      \ for detection operations\nif (context.IsValid()) {\n    // Perform detection\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Detection Logic
    code: "ExecutionContext detectContext = ExecutionContext::Detect();\nWorldObject*\
      \ target = detectContext.FindTargetInRange(player, 50.0f);\nif (target && detectContext.IsInLineOfSight(player,\
      \ target)) {\n    // Target is visible and within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as part of a larger detection system where
    multiple execution contexts may be created for different types of detection operations.
    The returned ExecutionContext should not be shared between threads without proper
    synchronization, as it may contain mutable state. The method does not perform
    any actual detection work itself but rather prepares the context for such operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned ExecutionContext is properly managed and cleaned
    up if it contains dynamic resources. Avoid creating excessive numbers of ExecutionContext
    instances in performance-critical code paths. The Detect method should only be
    called when a new detection context is required, not repeatedly for the same operation.
