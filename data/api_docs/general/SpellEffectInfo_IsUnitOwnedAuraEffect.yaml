documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell effect is an aura that is owned by a unit.
  description: The IsUnitOwnedAuraEffect method checks if the current spell effect
    represents an aura that is specifically owned by a unit, such as a player or creature.
    This is commonly used in spell processing to differentiate between self-applied
    auras and those applied by other units. The method evaluates internal flags and
    properties of the spell effect to determine ownership status. It's particularly
    useful for handling aura-specific logic where the owner of the aura affects behavior,
    such as stacking rules, duration modifications, or interaction with other auras.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell effect is an aura owned by a unit; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates that the aura was applied by a unit (such as a player
    or NPC) rather than being a passive or environment-based effect.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a spell effect is unit-owned
    code: "if (spellEffect->IsUnitOwnedAuraEffect())\n{\n    // Handle logic specific\
      \ to unit-owned auras\n    // e.g., apply stacking rules or modify aura duration\
      \ based on caster\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell effect flags and should be used during
    spell processing when the effect's ownership context is relevant. It may not accurately
    reflect all edge cases involving complex aura interactions or scripted effects.
