  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: CalculateOverallProgress
  signature: float StartupSpawnOrchestrator::CalculateOverallProgress() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall progress percentage of the server startup
    spawn process.
  description: The CalculateOverallProgress method computes the cumulative progress
    of all active spawn operations during the server's startup sequence. It aggregates
    individual spawn task progress values to determine how much of the total startup
    spawning has been completed. This method is typically invoked by the game loop
    or monitoring systems to provide real-time feedback on server initialization status.
    The returned value represents a normalized percentage between 0.0 and 1.0, where
    0.0 indicates no progress and 1.0 indicates completion of all spawn operations.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is thread-safe for read operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the overall percentage of
    startup spawn progress, where 0.0 means no progress has been made and 1.0 indicates
    all spawn operations have completed successfully.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float progress = sStartupSpawnOrchestrator->CalculateOverallProgress();

      printf("Startup progress: %.2f%%\n", progress * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Startup Progress
    code: "class StartupMonitor\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateProgress()\n    {\n  \
      \      float currentProgress = sStartupSpawnOrchestrator->CalculateOverallProgress();\n\
      \        if (currentProgress >= 1.0f)\n        {\n            printf(\"Server\
      \ startup complete!\\n\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n           \
      \ printf(\"Startup progress: %.1f%%\\n\", currentProgress * 100.0f);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only calculation and does not have side effects.
    It relies on internal tracking of spawn tasks and their individual progress values.
    The accuracy of the returned value depends on proper initialization and updating
    of spawn task progress by the orchestrator.
  warnings: The method assumes that all spawn operations are properly registered with
    the orchestrator. If spawn tasks are not correctly tracked, the calculated progress
    may be inaccurate or misleading.
