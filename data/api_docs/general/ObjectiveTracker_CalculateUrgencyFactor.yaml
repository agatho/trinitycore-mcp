  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: CalculateUrgencyFactor
  signature: float ObjectiveTracker::CalculateUrgencyFactor(Player * bot, const ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the urgency factor for an objective based on player state and
    objective conditions.
  description: The CalculateUrgencyFactor method determines how critical or time-sensitive
    a given objective is for a specific player. It evaluates various factors such
    as proximity to completion, time remaining, player level, and objective type to
    return a floating-point value that represents the urgency. This value is typically
    used by AI systems or quest management logic to prioritize which objectives should
    be pursued first. The method takes into account both the current state of the
    objective and the player's capabilities and circumstances.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or character for
      whom the urgency is being calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState object containing the current state
      information of the objective, including progress, time constraints, and other
      relevant conditions.
  returns: A float value representing the urgency factor of the objective. Higher
    values indicate higher urgency. Typically ranges from 0.0 (no urgency) to 1.0
    (maximum urgency), though values may exceed 1.0 in certain scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float urgency = objectiveTracker.CalculateUrgencyFactor(playerBot, currentObjectiveState);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Urgency for Priority Decision
    code: "if (objectiveTracker.CalculateUrgencyFactor(playerBot, state) > 0.8f)\n\
      {\n    // Prioritize this objective\n    Log(\"High urgency objective detected\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in AI decision-making processes for bots or automated
    quest handling. The exact calculation logic may depend on internal game mechanics
    such as quest timers, player level requirements, and proximity to objective completion.
    Ensure that the provided Player object and ObjectiveState are valid before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' or an invalid 'state' can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate input parameters before invoking this method
    in production code.
