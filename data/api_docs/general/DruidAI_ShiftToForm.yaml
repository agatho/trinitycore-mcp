  class: DruidAI
  method: ShiftToForm
  signature: bool DruidAI::ShiftToForm(DruidForm form)
documentation:
  brief: Shifts the DruidAI to the specified form, returning true if successful.
  description: The ShiftToForm method is used to transition a druid AI character into
    a specific shapeshift form. This method handles the logic required for switching
    between different druid forms such as cat, bear, moonkin, and others. It ensures
    that all necessary conditions are met before shifting, including checking for
    sufficient mana, proper spell availability, and valid form transitions. The method
    returns true if the shift was successfully executed, or false if the transition
    could not be completed due to constraints like insufficient resources or invalid
    form states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the druid successfully shifts into the specified form;
    otherwise returns false if the shift fails due to resource constraints, invalid
    state, or other conditions preventing the transformation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Form Shift
    code: "if (druidAI->ShiftToForm(DruidForm::CAT_FORM)) {\n    // Successfully shifted\
      \ to cat form\n    // Perform cat form specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Form Shift
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA) > 100 && druidAI->ShiftToForm(DruidForm::BEAR_FORM))\
      \ {\n    // Shift to bear form only if mana is sufficient\n    // Execute bear\
      \ form abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the AI's internal state management system and
    should be called only when appropriate for the druid's current context. It may
    internally check for combat status, spell cooldowns, and other game mechanics
    to determine if a form shift is valid.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying preconditions such as mana availability
    or valid form states might result in an invalid state transition. Ensure that
    the target form is appropriate for the current situation (e.g., avoid shifting
    into bear form while in combat with low health).
