  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetDefensiveManager
  signature: DefensiveManager * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetDefensiveManager()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the defensive behavior manager instance for combat integration.
  description: The GetDefensiveManager method returns a pointer to the DefensiveManager
    object associated with the CombatBehaviorIntegration instance. This manager handles
    all defensive AI behaviors and logic for the creature or unit it is attached to.
    The method provides access to defensive actions such as healing, shielding, and
    defensive positioning. It is typically used by AI systems to query and interact
    with defensive capabilities during combat scenarios. The returned pointer is valid
    only while the CombatBehaviorIntegration object exists and should not be stored
    beyond the scope of active combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the DefensiveManager instance, or nullptr if no defensive
    manager has been initialized for this integration component.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        DefensiveManager* defMgr = combatBehavior->GetDefensiveManager();\n\
      \        if (defMgr && defMgr->ShouldHeal())\n        {\n            // Perform\
      \ defensive healing logic\n            defMgr->ExecuteHealing();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's combat behavior integration system
    that allows for modular AI management. The DefensiveManager returned is typically
    initialized during the creature's setup phase and may be null if defensive behaviors
    are not enabled or configured for this specific unit.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance, as it may become invalid. Always check for null return values before
    using the defensive manager to avoid runtime errors.
