  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: WillPathIntersectObstacle
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::WillPathIntersectObstacle(const int &
    path, const ObstacleInfo & obstacle, float timeOffset)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given path will intersect with a specified obstacle
    within a certain time frame.
  description: The WillPathIntersectObstacle method evaluates if a path, defined by
    its identifier, will collide or intersect with a provided obstacle at any point
    during the specified time offset. This functionality is crucial for AI pathfinding
    and obstacle avoidance in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. It helps
    NPCs and creatures to dynamically adjust their movement to prevent collisions
    with environmental obstacles such as walls, doors, or other dynamic objects. The
    method uses internal path data and obstacle information to perform geometric calculations
    and returns a boolean result indicating intersection status.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific path that is being
      evaluated for potential intersection with an obstacle. This typically corresponds
      to a path index or handle used internally by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
  - name: obstacle
    description: A reference to an ObstacleInfo structure containing details about
      the obstacle, including its position, dimensions, and movement properties. This
      data is used to determine spatial relationships with the path.
  - name: timeOffset
    description: A floating-point value representing the time offset in seconds from
      the current moment during which the intersection check is performed. This allows
      for predictive analysis of future path-obstacle interactions.
  returns: Returns true if the specified path intersects with the obstacle at any
    point within the given time frame; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Intersection Check
    code: "ObstacleInfo obstacle;\n// Assume obstacle is initialized with valid data\n\
      float timeOffset = 2.0f;\nbool intersects = obstacleAvoidanceManager.WillPathIntersectObstacle(5,\
      \ obstacle, timeOffset);\nif (intersects) {\n    // Handle path avoidance logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Path Avoidance Decision
    code: "int currentPath = player.GetMovementInfo().GetPathId();\nObstacleInfo nearbyObstacle\
      \ = GetNearbyObstacle();\nfloat deltaTime = 1.5f;\nif (obstacleAvoidanceManager.WillPathIntersectObstacle(currentPath,\
      \ nearbyObstacle, deltaTime)) {\n    // Trigger alternative pathfinding\n  \
      \  player.SetMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_AVOID_OBSTACLE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate path and obstacle data to function correctly.
    Ensure that the path identifier corresponds to a valid path in the system, and
    that obstacle information is up-to-date. The timeOffset parameter allows for predictive
    behavior but may introduce performance overhead if used excessively in tight loops.
  warnings: Incorrectly initialized ObstacleInfo structures can lead to undefined
    behavior or false positives. Always validate input parameters before calling this
    method. Using large timeOffset values may cause unnecessary path recalculations,
    impacting performance.
