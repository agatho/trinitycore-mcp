  class: BrewmasterMonkRefactored
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float BrewmasterMonkRefactored::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the Brewmaster Monk based
    on current target and combat state.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which the
    Brewmaster Monk should engage their target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the monk's current stance, available
    abilities, target type, and environmental conditions within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned float value represents the distance in yards where the monk's primary
    abilities will be most effective. This method is typically used by the AI system
    to make decisions about movement and positioning during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. Returns 0.0f
    if no valid target exists or if the calculation cannot be performed due to invalid
    state conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "float optimalRange = monk->GetOptimalRange();\nif (optimalRange > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Move towards target at optimal distance\n    Position targetPos =\
      \ target->GetPosition();\n    Position optimalPos = targetPos; // Simplified\
      \ calculation\n    optimalPos.m_positionX += cos(target->GetOrientation()) *\
      \ optimalRange;\n    optimalPos.m_positionY += sin(target->GetOrientation())\
      \ * optimalRange;\n    // Move to optimal position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Brewmaster Monk's AI behavior system and relies
    on internal state tracking. The calculation may vary based on the monk's current
    form, buff/debuff status, and equipped items. Performance is generally optimal
    as it only performs calculations when needed during combat decision making.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or when the monk has no valid
    target, as it may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior. The returned
    range value should be used in conjunction with movement logic to ensure proper
    positioning.
