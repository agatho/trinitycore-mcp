  class: ThreatReference
  method: HeapNotifyDecreased
  signature: void ThreatReference::HeapNotifyDecreased()
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the threat heap that a threat value has decreased, allowing for
    potential reordering of entries.
  description: The HeapNotifyDecreased method is used within the ThreatReference class
    to signal that a creature's threat level has decreased. This notification is crucial
    for maintaining proper ordering within the threat heap structure, which is typically
    used in AI systems to manage and prioritize targets based on threat levels. When
    this method is invoked, it likely triggers internal logic to adjust the position
    of the current object within the heap data structure to reflect its new lower
    threat value. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return
    operations, serving purely as a signaling mechanism for heap management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Threat Management
    code: "void SomeCreatureAI::OnThreatDecreased()\n{\n    threatRef.HeapNotifyDecreased();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a creature's
    threat value drops below its current position in the heap. It may trigger a heapify-down
    operation to maintain heap properties. The method assumes that the object calling
    it is already registered in a threat heap and that the threat level has been appropriately
    updated prior to this call.
  warnings: Calling this method without first updating the threat value may lead to
    inconsistent heap state. Ensure that threat values are properly decremented before
    invoking this method to avoid incorrect heap ordering or potential crashes.
