  brief: Checks if the current tank unit has been defeated in combat
  description: The CheckForTankDeath method evaluates the current combat state to
    determine whether the primary tank unit (typically the player's main target) has
    been killed or become incapacitated. This method is crucial for AI behavior systems
    that need to react to tank deaths during encounters, such as adjusting threat
    levels, switching targets, or triggering specific event sequences. The method
    performs internal checks on the tank's health status and combat state flags without
    modifying any game objects directly. It returns a boolean value indicating whether
    the tank is considered dead or has left the combat state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tank unit has been defeated or removed from combat,
    false otherwise. The method does not throw exceptions but may return false if
    the tank is still active in combat or if no tank is currently assigned to the
    analyzer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Death Check
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForTankDeath()) {\n    // Handle tank death scenario\n\
      \    Log(\"Tank has been defeated!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat State Management with Tank Death Detection
    code: "void UpdateCombatAI() {\n    if (combatAnalyzer.CheckForTankDeath()) {\n\
      \        // Switch to new target\n        SetNewTarget();\n        // Reset\
      \ threat tracking\n        ResetThreat();\n        // Trigger event\n      \
      \  TriggerTankDeathEvent();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal combat state tracking and assumes that the
    CombatStateAnalyzer has been properly initialized with a valid tank reference.
    The method should only be called during active combat scenarios where tank status
    is expected to change. Performance is generally low as it performs simple state
    checks but may involve multiple internal flag evaluations.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat contexts as it may return unpredictable
    results or cause assertion failures if no valid tank reference exists. The method
    does not account for temporary invulnerability effects or stealth states that
    might prevent accurate death detection.
