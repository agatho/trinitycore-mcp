  class: Item
  method: SetBinding
  signature: void Item::SetBinding(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the binding status of an item to true or false.
  description: The SetBinding method controls whether an item is bound to the player
    who picks it up. When set to true, the item becomes soulbound, meaning it cannot
    be traded or auctioned to other players. When set to false, the item can be freely
    traded or auctioned. This method is typically used during item creation or modification
    processes and affects the item's binding state in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the item should be bound (true)
      or not bound (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Binding an item to a player
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetBinding(true);

      // Item is now soulbound

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Unbinding an item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetBinding(false);

      // Item can now be traded

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the item's binding state and is typically called
    during item creation or modification. The binding status influences how items
    behave in terms of trading, auctioning, and loot mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to items being incorrectly bound
    or unbound, potentially affecting gameplay balance and player interactions. Be
    cautious when setting binding status for items that are already in the game world.
