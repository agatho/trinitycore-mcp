  class: QuestCompletion
  method: SetMaxConcurrentQuests
  signature: void QuestCompletion::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(uint32 botGuid, uint32 maxQuests)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of concurrent quests allowed for a specific bot character.
  description: The SetMaxConcurrentQuests method configures the maximum number of
    quests that can be active simultaneously for a given bot character identified
    by its GUID. This method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven
    bots to control quest load and prevent overwhelming the game's quest tracking
    system. The setting affects how many quests the bot will attempt to progress at
    once, which can help manage performance and ensure quest completion efficiency.
    This configuration is usually applied before initiating questing activities and
    may influence the bot's behavior during quest acquisition and progression.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to set
      the maximum concurrent quests. This value must correspond to a valid bot in
      the system.
  - name: maxQuests
    description: The maximum number of concurrent quests allowed for the specified
      bot. Must be a positive integer, typically between 1 and 10 depending on game
      mechanics and desired behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: QuestCompletion::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(12345, 3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Maximum Quests for Multiple Bots
    code: 'uint32 bot1Guid = 1001;

      uint32 bot2Guid = 1002;

      QuestCompletion::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(bot1Guid, 5);

      QuestCompletion::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(bot2Guid, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal quest tracking data structures for the
    specified bot. It should be called before starting questing activities to ensure
    proper initialization. The value of maxQuests may be bounded by game limitations
    or system constraints, and setting it too high could potentially cause performance
    issues or quest tracking problems.
  warnings: Setting maxQuests to zero or a negative value may result in undefined
    behavior or questing failures. This method should not be called during active
    quest progression as it might interfere with ongoing quest states. Ensure that
    botGuid corresponds to an existing bot to avoid invalid operations.
