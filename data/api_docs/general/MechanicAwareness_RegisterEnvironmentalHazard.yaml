  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: RegisterEnvironmentalHazard
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::RegisterEnvironmentalHazard(const int & location,
    float radius, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an environmental hazard at a specified location with given radius
    and duration.
  description: The RegisterEnvironmentalHazard method is used to add a hazardous area
    to the game world that affects players within its radius for a defined duration.
    This method is typically utilized by AI systems or game mechanics to create dynamic
    environmental threats such as explosions, poison clouds, fire zones, or other
    dangerous areas. The hazard will be tracked and applied to affected players until
    the specified duration expires. The location parameter defines where the hazard
    is centered, the radius determines how far it extends, and the duration controls
    how long the effect lasts.
  parameters:
  - name: location
    description: The integer identifier representing the location where the environmental
      hazard will be placed. This typically corresponds to a specific zone or coordinate
      system within the game world.
  - name: radius
    description: The float value defining the radius of the environmental hazard in
      game units. Players within this radius will be affected by the hazard.
  - name: duration
    description: The uint32 value specifying how long the environmental hazard will
      remain active, measured in milliseconds. After this time, the hazard will automatically
      expire and cease affecting players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Environmental Hazard Registration
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      awareness.RegisterEnvironmentalHazard(12345, 10.0f, 5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Temporary Fire Zone
    code: 'uint32 fireZoneId = 67890;

      float zoneRadius = 15.0f;

      uint32 durationMs = 30000; // 30 seconds

      MechanicAwareness awareness;

      awareness.RegisterEnvironmentalHazard(fireZoneId, zoneRadius, durationMs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's AI and environmental systems
    to track player proximity and apply appropriate effects. The location identifier
    may correspond to predefined zones or dynamic coordinates. Developers should ensure
    that the radius and duration values are reasonable for game balance and performance
    considerations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unbalanced gameplay or performance
    issues. Ensure that hazard locations do not cause unintended player clipping or
    collision problems. The duration parameter should be carefully chosen to avoid
    creating permanent or overly long-lasting hazards.
