  signature: void AuctionBotConfig::SetAHBotExcludes(const std::string & AHBotExcludes)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the list of item classes to exclude from Auction House bot operations
  description: This method configures which item classes should be excluded from being
    processed by the Auction House bot. The input string contains a comma-separated
    list of item class IDs that will be ignored during auction creation and management
    by the AHBot. This allows administrators to prevent certain types of items (such
    as quest items or specific categories) from being automatically listed on the
    auction house. The method updates internal configuration data used by the AuctionBot
    system for filtering item types.
  parameters:
  - name: AHBotExcludes
    description: A comma-separated string of item class IDs to exclude from AHBot
      operations. Each ID should correspond to a valid ItemClass value in the game's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Exclude common and trade goods item classes
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetAHBotExcludes("0,7");
    language: cpp
  - title: Exclude multiple item categories including weapons and armor
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetAHBotExcludes("2,4,6,7,12");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the AuctionBot's internal exclusion list. Changes
    take effect immediately for subsequent auction operations. The method does not
    validate that the provided class IDs exist in the database - invalid IDs will
    be silently ignored during processing.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted input strings may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure
    all item class IDs are valid and separated by commas without spaces to avoid parsing
    errors.
