  signature: int MarketAnalysis::ScanForMeanReversion()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify potential mean reversion opportunities in
    item pricing.
  description: The ScanForMeanReversion method performs a statistical analysis on
    historical and current market item prices to detect patterns indicative of mean
    reversion. This technique is commonly used in trading strategies where prices
    tend to return to an average level over time. The method evaluates price deviations
    from the mean and calculates confidence levels for potential buy/sell signals.
    It operates within the context of TrinityCore's auction house system, analyzing
    item pricing trends to assist players or automated systems in making informed
    trading decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer value representing the analysis result: 0 indicates
    no significant mean reversion opportunities found, positive values indicate potential
    buy signals (higher confidence), negative values indicate potential sell signals
    (higher confidence). A return value of -1 typically signifies an error or insufficient
    data for analysis.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint result = analyzer.ScanForMeanReversion();\n\
      if (result > 0) {\n    // Potential buy opportunity\n    printf(\"Buy signal\
      \ detected with confidence: %d\\n\", result);\n} else if (result < 0) {\n  \
      \  // Potential sell opportunity\n    printf(\"Sell signal detected with confidence:\
      \ %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // No significant opportunities\n    printf(\"\
      No mean reversion opportunities found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires sufficient historical market data to perform meaningful
    analysis. Performance may be impacted when processing large datasets. The implementation
    uses statistical algorithms to calculate z-scores and standard deviations for
    price deviation analysis.
  warnings: The method assumes that market prices follow a normal distribution for
    mean reversion analysis, which may not always hold true in volatile or manipulated
    markets. Results should be used as one factor among many in trading decisions.
