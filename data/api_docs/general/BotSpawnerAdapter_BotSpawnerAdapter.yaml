documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotSpawnerAdapter class for managing bot
    spawning operations in TrinityCore.
  description: The BotSpawnerAdapter constructor initializes the necessary internal
    state and resources required for handling bot spawning within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up the adapter to interact with the core game systems,
    including player management, spawn point handling, and bot behavior configuration.
    It prepares the object for subsequent operations such as creating, managing, or
    destroying bot instances within the game world. The initialization process typically
    involves setting default values for spawn parameters, establishing connections
    to relevant subsystems, and preparing data structures needed for efficient bot
    deployment.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotSpawnerAdapter instance
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;

      // The spawner is now ready to manage bot spawning operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any actual bot spawning; it only initializes
    the adapter for future use. The class likely requires additional configuration
    or method calls before it can effectively spawn bots in the game world.
