  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: UpdateStatistics
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::UpdateStatistics(uint32 opcode, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal statistics for packet relay operations based on opcode and
    success status.
  description: The UpdateStatistics method is responsible for maintaining performance
    and operational metrics within the BotPacketRelay class. It tracks how many times
    specific opcodes are processed and whether those operations were successful or
    not. This information can be used for debugging, performance monitoring, or optimizing
    bot behavior in World of Warcraft. The method likely updates internal counters
    or logs that help administrators understand relay efficiency and identify potential
    issues with packet handling.
  parameters:
  - name: opcode
    description: The opcode identifier of the packet being processed. This value determines
      which type of operation is tracked in the statistics.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the packet relay operation completed
      successfully (true) or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.UpdateStatistics(1234, true); // Track successful packet with opcode 1234

      relay.UpdateStatistics(1234, false); // Track failed packet with same opcode'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the bot system when processing
    packets through the relay mechanism. It may be used in conjunction with other
    methods that provide access to collected statistics for reporting or analysis
    purposes.
