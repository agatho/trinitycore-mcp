  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: NormalizeBracketPercentages
  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::NormalizeBracketPercentages()
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes the percentage distribution of bot levels across different brackets.
  description: The NormalizeBracketPercentages method adjusts the percentage values
    assigned to various level brackets in the bot distribution system. This ensures
    that all bracket percentages sum up to 100% while maintaining their relative proportions.
    The method is typically called after modifying individual bracket percentages
    to maintain data integrity and prevent distribution skewing. It plays a crucial
    role in balancing AI behavior across different player levels within the TrinityCore
    framework.

    adjustments to bracket percentages. It's designed to maintain mathematical consistency
    in the bot level distribution system.
