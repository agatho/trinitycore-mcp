  signature: void BotAIInitializer::LoadCombatActions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads combat action handlers for bot AI.
  description: The LoadCombatActions method is responsible for setting up and registering
    all available combat actions within the BotAI system. This method ensures that
    bots can properly execute combat behaviors such as attacking targets, using abilities,
    and managing combat states. It typically iterates through predefined action sets
    and configures them based on bot class, level, and equipped items. The method
    is called during the initialization phase of a bot's AI to ensure all necessary
    combat functionality is ready for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBotAI(BotAIInitializer& initializer) {\n    // Other initialization\
      \ code...\n    initializer.LoadCombatActions();\n    // Continue with AI setup...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's AI initialization
    phase. It is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot is created or when its AI system is enabled. The method may perform heavy
    operations such as loading action databases and setting up internal mappings,
    so it should not be called repeatedly.
  warnings: Calling LoadCombatActions multiple times on the same BotAIInitializer
    instance may lead to duplicate action registrations or memory leaks. Ensure this
    method is only invoked during initialization and not during active gameplay.
