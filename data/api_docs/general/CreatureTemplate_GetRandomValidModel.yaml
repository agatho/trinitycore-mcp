  signature: const CreatureModel * CreatureTemplate::GetRandomValidModel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a randomly selected valid creature model from the template's model
    list.
  description: The GetRandomValidModel method retrieves a random creature model entry
    from the CreatureTemplate's collection of valid models. This is typically used
    during creature spawning to assign an appropriate visual model to the spawned
    NPC. The method ensures that only valid models (those present in the database
    and not marked as invalid) are returned. It's commonly called when creating new
    creature instances to determine their initial visual appearance. The selection
    process considers all available models for the creature template and picks one
    at random, which helps provide variety in creature appearances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a CreatureModel object representing the randomly selected
    valid model, or nullptr if no valid models exist for this creature template.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Spawning
    code: "CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (creatureTemplate)\n{\n    const CreatureModel* model = creatureTemplate->GetRandomValidModel();\n\
      \    if (model)\n    {\n        // Use model->modelid to set the creature's\
      \ display ID\n        creature->SetDisplayId(model->modelid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal model list of the CreatureTemplate being
    properly populated. The random selection is based on a uniform distribution across
    all valid models. Performance is generally fast as it only involves accessing
    an array and performing a random index lookup.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no valid models exist for the creature
    template, so always check for nullptr before using the result. This method should
    not be called during creature template loading phases when model data might not
    yet be fully initialized.
