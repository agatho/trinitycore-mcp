  signature: void BotAIQuestIntegration::UpdateQuestManager(BotAI * ai, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest manager state for a bot AI instance.
  description: The UpdateQuestManager method is responsible for processing and updating
    the quest-related state of a bot AI instance within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method handles quest acceptance, completion tracking, objective progression,
    and interaction with quest givers. It ensures that bot characters follow quest
    logic consistent with player behavior while maintaining performance efficiency.
    The method operates on a per-tick basis using a time delta parameter to manage
    timing-sensitive quest operations.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose quest manager state needs to
      be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last update call. Used to determine
      timing for quest-related actions and cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n \
      \   m_questManager->UpdateQuestManager(this, diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom quest handling
    code: "void CustomBotAI::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Perform custom bot logic\n\
      \    if (m_isQuestActive)\n    {\n        m_questManager->UpdateQuestManager(this,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n    // Continue with other AI behaviors\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the bot's update loop to maintain
    quest state consistency. The 'diff' parameter is crucial for proper timing of
    quest-related actions such as quest completion checks and objective updates. Performance
    considerations include avoiding heavy computations within this method to prevent
    AI lag.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'ai' parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance is properly initialized before calling this method.
    The 'diff' value should represent actual elapsed time for correct quest timing.
