  signature: bool MovementArbiter::IsDuplicate(const MovementRequest & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a movement request is a duplicate of an existing request
    in the arbiter's tracking system.
  description: The IsDuplicate method checks if a given MovementRequest has already
    been processed or is currently being tracked by the MovementArbiter. This functionality
    helps prevent redundant processing of identical movement commands, which can occur
    when players send repeated movement packets due to network latency or client-side
    issues. The method typically compares key identifiers such as GUIDs, timestamps,
    or movement parameters to detect duplicates. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    efficient resource usage and preventing potential exploits related to duplicate
    movement commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided MovementRequest is identified as a duplicate
    within the arbiter's tracking system; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Duplicate Movement Requests
    code: "MovementArbiter arbiter;\nMovementRequest request;\n// ... populate request\
      \ with data ...\nbool isDuplicate = arbiter.IsDuplicate(request);\nif (isDuplicate)\n\
      {\n    // Handle duplicate request - e.g., ignore or log\n    printf(\"Duplicate\
      \ movement request detected\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal tracking structures such as hash maps or
    sets to store and compare movement request signatures. Performance is critical
    since this check may be performed frequently during player movement. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Care must be taken when implementing duplicate detection logic to avoid
    false positives that could cause legitimate movement commands to be ignored. Ensure
    the comparison criteria are robust enough to distinguish between actual duplicates
    and similar but distinct requests.
