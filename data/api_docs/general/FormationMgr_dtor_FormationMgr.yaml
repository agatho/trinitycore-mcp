documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FormationMgr instance and cleans up associated formation data.
  description: The ~FormationMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all resources associated with a FormationMgr object. This includes releasing any
    memory allocated for formation data structures, removing references to creatures
    in formations, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, formations are used to manage group positioning and
    movement patterns for groups of creatures or NPCs. The destructor ensures that
    when a FormationMgr instance is destroyed, all related formation information is
    properly freed to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FormationMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    FormationMgr* mgr = new FormationMgr();\n \
      \   // ... use the formation manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Triggers ~FormationMgr\
      \ destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when a FormationMgr object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects
    hold references to formations managed by this manager before destruction, as the
    destructor will invalidate all formation data.
