  signature: uint32 NavMeshInterface::FindSmoothPath(Map * map, const int & path,
    int & smoothPath, uint32 maxSmoothPoints) const
documentation:
  brief: Computes a smooth navigation path for a given map and path index, returning
    the number of points in the smoothed path.
  description: The FindSmoothPath method calculates a smoothed version of a previously
    computed navigation path for a specified map. It takes an existing path index
    and generates a new smooth path that can be used for character movement, avoiding
    obstacles and following natural terrain contours. The method operates on a precomputed
    path stored in the NavMeshInterface's internal path cache. The resulting smooth
    path is stored in the provided smoothPath parameter, which must be allocated with
    sufficient capacity to hold up to maxSmoothPoints points. This function is essential
    for realistic NPC movement and player pathfinding in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object for which the smooth path is calculated.
      Must be a valid map instance with navigation mesh data loaded.
  - name: path
    description: Index identifier of the precomputed path to be smoothed. This should
      correspond to a valid path previously stored in the NavMeshInterface's internal
      cache.
  - name: smoothPath
    description: Reference to an integer that will store the index of the newly computed
      smooth path. This path index can be used with other NavMeshInterface methods
      for further processing or movement execution.
  - name: maxSmoothPoints
    description: Maximum number of points allowed in the resulting smooth path. Determines
      the buffer size needed for the smooth path data structure.
  returns: Returns the actual number of points in the computed smooth path. If the
    operation fails or no valid path exists, it may return zero or an error code depending
    on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindSmoothPath
    code: "Map* map = ...; // Valid map instance\nint pathIndex = 5; // Precomputed\
      \ path index\nint smoothPathIndex;\nuint32 maxPoints = 100;\nuint32 pointCount\
      \ = navMeshInterface->FindSmoothPath(map, pathIndex, smoothPathIndex, maxPoints);\n\
      if (pointCount > 0)\n{\n    // Use smoothPathIndex to access the smoothed path\n\
      \    // The path contains pointCount waypoints\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid path has already been computed and stored
    in the NavMeshInterface's internal path cache. The smooth path generation process
    involves complex algorithms to ensure natural movement while avoiding collisions
    with static geometry or dynamic obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'map' parameter is not null and that the 'path' index
    corresponds to a valid precomputed path. Failure to meet these conditions may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. The smoothPathIndex returned should be
    used immediately as it may become invalid if other path operations are performed.
