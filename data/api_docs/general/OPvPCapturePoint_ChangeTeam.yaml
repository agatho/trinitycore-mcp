  method: ChangeTeam
  signature: void OPvPCapturePoint::ChangeTeam(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the controlling team of an OPvP capture point.
  description: The ChangeTeam method is used to transfer control of an OPvP (Open
    PvP) capture point from one faction to another. This method typically updates
    the internal state of the capture point, including its controlling faction, visual
    representation, and associated game mechanics such as resource generation or territorial
    benefits. It may also trigger related events or callbacks within the OPvP system
    to notify other components of the change in control. The method is usually invoked
    when a battle for the capture point concludes, either through player activity
    or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The new team ID that will control the capture point. Typically, this
      corresponds to either the Alliance (1) or Horde (2) faction IDs in TrinityCore's
      implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Change Capture Point Control to Horde
    code: "OPvPCapturePoint* capturePoint = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetCapturePointByGuid(guid);\n\
      if (capturePoint)\n{\n    capturePoint->ChangeTeam(2); // Assign to Horde\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Team Switch Based on Player Faction
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid\nuint32 newTeamId = player->GetTeamId();\n\
      OPvPCapturePoint* capturePoint = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetCapturePointByGuid(guid);\n\
      if (capturePoint)\n{\n    capturePoint->ChangeTeam(newTeamId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Outdoor PvP system in TrinityCore and is expected
    to be called during battle resolution or scripted events. It does not directly
    modify player states but affects the game world's control over the capture point,
    which may influence quest progress, rewards, or territorial bonuses.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 represents a valid team ID (typically 1 for Alliance,
    2 for Horde). Passing an invalid team ID could lead to undefined behavior or visual
    inconsistencies in the OPvP system.
