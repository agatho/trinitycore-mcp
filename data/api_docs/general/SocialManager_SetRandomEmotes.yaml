  signature: void SocialManager::SetRandomEmotes(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables random emote behavior for the social manager.
  description: The SetRandomEmotes method controls whether random emotes are enabled
    for the social manager. When enabled, players may randomly perform emotes in response
    to various in-game events or interactions. This functionality is typically used
    to enhance player engagement and add dynamic social elements to the game world.
    The method does not validate input parameters beyond the boolean flag, so calling
    with true will enable random emotes while false will disable them. This setting
    affects all players managed by this social manager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Random Emotes
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetRandomEmotes(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Random Emotes
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetRandomEmotes(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the SocialManager class.
    It's recommended to call this during initialization or configuration phases rather
    than dynamically during gameplay to avoid potential performance impacts from frequent
    state changes. The random emote behavior is typically tied to player interaction
    events and may have associated cooldowns or probability thresholds.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly in quick succession might cause unexpected
    behavior if other systems depend on the current emote state. Ensure that any dependent
    systems are properly synchronized with the social manager's state changes.
