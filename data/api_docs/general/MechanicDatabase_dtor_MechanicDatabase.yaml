documentation:
  brief: Destroys the MechanicDatabase instance and releases all associated resources
  description: The ~MechanicDatabase destructor is automatically invoked when a MechanicDatabase
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of database connections, memory allocations, and any internal data structures
    used by the mechanic database system. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this typically handles closing database connections and freeing memory that was
    allocated during the object's lifetime. The destructor is called as part of the
    normal C++ object lifecycle and should not be invoked manually.

  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of MechanicDatabase instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    MechanicDatabase db;\n    // ... use db ...\n\
      } // Destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process ensures that database
    connections are properly closed and resources are freed to prevent memory leaks.
