documentation:
  brief: Updates performance metrics for the Mage AI behavior.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method is responsible for maintaining
    and updating performance-related statistics within the MageAI class. This method
    typically tracks how efficiently the AI is executing spell casts, managing cooldowns,
    or handling various combat behaviors. It may also update internal timers or counters
    that help determine optimal spell selection or timing decisions based on recent
    performance data. The method is usually called periodically during the AI's update
    cycle to ensure accurate tracking of performance over time.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdatePerformanceMetrics(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal counters or timers that track spell
    cast times, cooldown usage, and overall AI responsiveness. It's important to understand
    that performance metrics may be used for decision-making in more complex AI behaviors
    such as choosing between different spells based on recent success rates.
