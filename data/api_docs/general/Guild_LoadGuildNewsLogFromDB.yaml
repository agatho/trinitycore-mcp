  signature: void Guild::LoadGuildNewsLogFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the guild's news log entries from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGuildNewsLogFromDB method retrieves all recent guild news events,
    such as member joins, resignations, and other significant activities, from the
    database and populates the internal news log structure. This method is typically
    invoked during guild initialization or when the guild's news log needs to be refreshed.
    It processes the database result set and stores the data in a format suitable
    for display in the guild interface. The method does not take any parameters and
    operates on the guild's internal state, making it essential for maintaining up-to-date
    guild activity information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Guild News Log During Initialization
    code: "void InitializeGuild()\n{\n    // Assume guild is already created\n   \
      \ guild->LoadGuildNewsLogFromDB(nullptr);\n    // News log is now populated\
      \ with data from DB\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the guild has been properly initialized
    and connected to the database. It performs a direct database query which may impact
    performance if the guild has a large amount of news log entries. The method assumes
    that the database connection is valid and that the required tables exist.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all necessary preconditions are met before invoking
    this method, especially when dealing with large guilds or high-frequency updates.
