  class: Battleground
  method: SetBgMap
  signature: void Battleground::SetBgMap(BattlegroundMap * map)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the battleground map associated with this battleground instance.
  description: The SetBgMap method assigns a BattlegroundMap object to the current
    battleground instance. This method is typically used during battleground initialization
    or when transitioning between different map states. The assigned map object contains
    the specific game world data, including terrain, objectives, and spawn points
    relevant to the battleground. It ensures that the battleground has access to its
    corresponding map environment for proper gameplay mechanics such as player positioning,
    objective handling, and zone-based events.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the BattlegroundMap object that represents the map associated
      with this battleground. Must be a valid pointer to a BattlegroundMap instance
      or nullptr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a battleground map during initialization
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new Battleground();

      BattlegroundMap* bgMap = new BattlegroundMap();

      bg->SetBgMap(bgMap);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing the battleground map reference
    code: 'Battleground* bg = GetBattleground();

      bg->SetBgMap(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the map pointer without performing any deep
    copy or validation. It is expected that the provided map object remains valid
    for the lifetime of the battleground instance. The method does not trigger any
    additional side effects or event notifications.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer may lead to undefined behavior if other
    parts of the code attempt to access the map after this assignment. Ensure that
    the BattlegroundMap object is properly initialized before calling this method.
