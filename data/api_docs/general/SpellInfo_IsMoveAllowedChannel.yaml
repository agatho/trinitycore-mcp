documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell allows channeling while moving.
  description: This method checks if a spell permits channeling while the player is
    moving, which is crucial for understanding spell mechanics and movement restrictions
    in World of Warcraft. It returns true if the spell can be channeled while moving,
    false otherwise. The method is commonly used to validate whether a spell's channeling
    behavior is compatible with player movement during casting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell allows channeling while moving, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell's channeling can be maintained during movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsMoveAllowedChannel()) {\n    // Spell allows channeling\
      \ while moving\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related spell
    checks and may be affected by various game mechanics such as player movement speed,
    casting time, and spell restrictions. Implementation depends on the specific spell's
    properties.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a spell can be cast while
    moving; it specifically concerns channeling behavior. Misusing this method could
    lead to incorrect movement validation.
