  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetActiveQuests
  signature: int QuestCompletion::GetActiveQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of active quests assigned to a player character.
  description: The GetActiveQuests method counts and returns the total number of currently
    active quests for the specified player. Active quests are those that have been
    accepted by the player but not yet completed or turned in. This method is commonly
    used in AI scripting and quest management systems within TrinityCore to determine
    the current quest load of a bot or player character. The function iterates through
    all available quests in the player's quest log and filters for those marked as
    active, which typically includes quests with progress greater than zero but not
    yet at completion status.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of active quests assigned to the
    player. Returns 0 if no active quests are found or if the input player pointer
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint activeQuestCount\
      \ = QuestCompletion::GetActiveQuests(bot);\nif (activeQuestCount > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Process active quests\n    printf(\"Player has %d active quests\\n\"\
      , activeQuestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of the player's quest log and may have
    performance implications when called frequently in high-frequency loops. It assumes
    that the Player object passed is valid and properly initialized with quest data.
    The implementation relies on internal quest tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's
    core quest system.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or uninitialized Player pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of the player
    object before invoking this function. Additionally, the returned count may not
    reflect real-time updates if quest states change outside of normal gameplay flow.
