  class: Unit
  method: SetSwim
  signature: bool Unit::SetSwim(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables swimming mode for the unit, allowing it to move through
    water.
  description: The SetSwim method toggles the swimming state of a Unit object, which
    determines whether the unit can move through water environments. When enabled,
    the unit will be able to swim in water; when disabled, the unit will not be able
    to swim and will revert to normal movement behavior. This method affects the unit's
    movement capabilities and is typically used during gameplay to control character
    movement in aquatic environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the swimming mode was successfully enabled or false if
    it was disabled, indicating the operation completed without error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nbool success = unit->SetSwim(true);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Swimming mode enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the unit's movement behavior
    and may interact with other movement-related methods. It is typically called during
    gameplay when a unit needs to enter or exit water.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected movement behavior, especially
    if not properly synchronized with other movement state changes. Avoid calling
    this method without considering the unit's current state.
