  method: RemoveActiveEvent
  signature: void GameEventMgr::RemoveActiveEvent(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified game event from the active events list, stopping its
    effects and cleanup.
  description: The RemoveActiveEvent method removes a game event identified by its
    unique event_id from the currently active events list within the GameEventMgr.
    This action effectively disables the event's ongoing effects, such as seasonal
    activities, holiday celebrations, or temporary world states. The method ensures
    that any resources associated with the event are properly cleaned up and that
    affected game objects, creatures, or players are returned to their normal state.
    It is typically invoked when an event concludes naturally or is manually disabled
    by administrative commands or scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to be removed from the active
      events list. This ID corresponds to a registered event in the game's event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove an Active Game Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->RemoveActiveEvent(42);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditionally Remove Event Based on State
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->IsActiveEvent(100))\n{\n    sGameEventMgr->RemoveActiveEvent(100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the event_id is currently active before
    attempting removal. It is recommended to check if an event is active using IsActiveEvent()
    prior to calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations. The operation is
    thread-safe within the context of TrinityCore's event management system.
  warnings: Calling RemoveActiveEvent with an invalid or non-existent event_id may
    lead to undefined behavior or silent failures. Always ensure that the event exists
    and is active before removal. Improper use can cause inconsistencies in game state
    or affect player experience during events.
