  class: CollectionMgr
  method: ToySetFavorite
  signature: void CollectionMgr::ToySetFavorite(uint32 itemId, bool favorite)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the favorite status of a toy item in the player's collection.
  description: The ToySetFavorite method updates the favorite status of a specified
    toy item within the player's collection. This functionality allows players to
    mark toys as favorites, which can be used for quick access or organization purposes
    within the game interface. The method modifies the internal state of the toy collection
    and persists the change to the database. It is typically invoked when a player
    interacts with a toy in their inventory or collection window to toggle its favorite
    status.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the toy item to update. This value corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's item database and must reference a valid toy
      item.
  - name: favorite
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the toy should be marked as favorite
      (true) or not (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Mark a Toy as Favorite
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->ToySetFavorite(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Favorite Status from a Toy
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->ToySetFavorite(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the player's toy collection
    data structure and may synchronize changes with the database. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId corresponds to an actual toy item in the game database;
    otherwise, the operation might have no effect or could potentially cause issues.
    Avoid calling this method outside of valid player interaction contexts.
