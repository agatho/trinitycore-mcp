  class: GroupCoordination
  method: AdjustFormation
  signature: void GroupCoordination::AdjustFormation(const int & members)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the formation of group members based on the provided member count.
  description: The AdjustFormation method modifies the positioning and grouping behavior
    of players within a group based on the number of members specified. This method
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to dynamically
    adjust how players are arranged during group activities such as raids, dungeons,
    or battlegrounds. It ensures optimal positioning for gameplay mechanics like threat
    distribution, spell targeting, or visual coordination. The method likely updates
    internal group data structures and may trigger UI refreshes or movement adjustments
    for the affected players.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: An integer reference indicating the desired number of group members
      to adjust formation for. This value determines how many players should be considered
      when recalculating group positioning.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = new GroupCoordination();

      int memberCount = 5;

      coord->AdjustFormation(memberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Adjustment
    code: "void UpdateGroupFormation(Player* player, int newMemberCount) {\n    if\
      \ (Group* group = player->GetGroup()) {\n        GroupCoordination coord;\n\
      \        coord.AdjustFormation(newMemberCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may interact with internal group management systems and could
    potentially affect player positioning in real-time. It should be called only when
    necessary to avoid unnecessary performance overhead. The adjustment logic might
    vary depending on the group type (raid, party) and current game context.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context or invalid member counts
    may lead to undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that the provided
    member count is valid and corresponds to an actual group size before invoking
    this function.
