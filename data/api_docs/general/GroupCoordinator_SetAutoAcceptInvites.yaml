documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic acceptance of group invites for the player.
  description: The SetAutoAcceptInvites method configures whether a player's character
    will automatically accept incoming group invitations from other players. When
    enabled, the player will automatically join any group invite they receive without
    manual confirmation. When disabled, the player must manually accept or decline
    each group invitation. This setting affects the player's group invitation behavior
    in World of Warcraft and is typically used to streamline gameplay for players
    who frequently join groups. The change takes effect immediately and persists across
    sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      automatic group invite acceptance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Accept Invites

  - title: Disable Auto Accept Invites
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetAutoAcceptInvites(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the player's group invitation settings at runtime. The
    setting is typically stored in the player's database record and loaded when the
    character logs in. This functionality is commonly used by players who want to
    avoid manual confirmation of group invites during raid or dungeon activities.
