documentation:
  brief: Returns the target unit selected by the group's current targeting logic
  description: The GetGroupTarget method retrieves the Unit object that represents
    the currently selected target for the group. This target is typically determined
    by the group's AI behavior, which may consider factors such as threat levels,
    target priority, and group coordination rules. The method returns a pointer to
    the target unit if one exists, or nullptr if no valid target is available. In
    a World of Warcraft TrinityCore context, this method would commonly be used within
    AI scripts to determine what enemy unit the group should focus on attacking next.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the group's current target, or
    nullptr if no target is selected
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(const uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        Unit* target = GetGroupTarget();\n        if (target\
      \ && !target->IsDead()) {\n            // Attack the group target\n        \
      \    me->Attack(target, true);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the group's internal targeting state and may be affected
    by external factors such as target switching events or unit death. The returned
    Unit pointer should always be validated for null before use to prevent dereferencing
    issues.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned Unit pointer is valid without checking
    for nullptr. The target may become invalid if the unit dies or leaves the group,
    so proper error handling is essential when using this method in AI logic.
