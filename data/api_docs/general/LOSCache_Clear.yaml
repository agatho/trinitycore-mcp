documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached line-of-sight entries from the LOSCache.
  description: The LOSCache::Clear method removes all cached line-of-sight data from
    the cache, effectively resetting its contents. This is typically used when the
    state of the game world changes significantly, such as during map transitions
    or when clearing outdated visibility data. The method ensures that subsequent
    line-of-sight queries will recalculate results rather than using stale cached
    values. No parameters are required, and the operation is performed in-place on
    the cache instance.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LOSCache cache;

      cache.Clear(); // Clears all cached line-of-sight data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe if the underlying cache implementation supports
    concurrent access. It may impact performance temporarily if a large number of
    entries were previously cached, as it invalidates all stored data and forces recalculation
    on next query.
