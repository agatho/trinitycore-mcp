  class: BotActionExtended
  method: InteractQuestObject
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::InteractQuestObject(int bot, int
    object, uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveIndex, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates interaction with a quest object for a bot, handling quest progression
    and objective tracking.
  description: The InteractQuestObject method is used to simulate or trigger a bot's
    interaction with a specific quest-related object in the World of Warcraft environment.
    This action typically involves engaging with an item, NPC, or GameObject that
    is part of a quest objective. The method takes into account the bot's current
    state, the quest ID, and the specific objective index to determine how the interaction
    should be processed. It returns a BotActionExtended object which represents the
    queued action for the bot to execute. This method is commonly used in automated
    questing systems where bots need to interact with various game objects to complete
    objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier or index of the bot that will perform the interaction.
      Must be a valid bot instance within the system.
  - name: object
    description: The identifier of the quest object (NPC, GameObject, etc.) to interact
      with. This should correspond to a valid in-game object.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that contains the objective being
      interacted with. Must be a valid quest ID.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific quest objective within the quest. Used
      to determine which objective is being completed or interacted with.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A timestamp value used for tracking and ordering interactions. Should
      be a valid time value in milliseconds since epoch.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object that represents the queued interaction
    action for the bot. This object contains information about the action to be performed
    and can be used for further processing or state management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Object Interaction
    code: 'BotActionExtended action = botManager->InteractQuestObject(1, 12345, 10245,
      0, GetTickCount());

      // This initiates interaction with object ID 12345 for quest 10245, completing
      objective index 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Progression Handling
    code: "uint32 currentTimestamp = GetTickCount();\nBotActionExtended action = botManager->InteractQuestObject(\n\
      \    botId,\n    questObjective->GetObjectGuid().GetRawValue(),\n    questId,\n\
      \    questObjective->GetIndex(),\n    currentTimestamp\n);\n// Process the returned\
      \ action for execution in the bot's action queue"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has proper access to the specified quest
    and object. The timestamp parameter is crucial for maintaining order of actions
    when multiple interactions occur rapidly. The method internally handles validation
    of the quest state and objective completion before queuing the interaction.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId and objectiveIndex parameters are valid, as invalid
    values may cause undefined behavior or failed quest progression. This method should
    not be called with invalid bot identifiers or object references, which could lead
    to crashes or unexpected game state changes.
