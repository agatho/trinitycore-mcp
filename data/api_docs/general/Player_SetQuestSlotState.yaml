documentation:
  brief: Sets the state of a quest slot for the player.
  description: This method allows developers to set the state of a specific quest
    slot for a player, which is crucial for managing quest progress and completion
    status within the game. The method operates on the player's quest log, updating
    the quest state in the specified slot. It is commonly used when implementing quest
    system mechanics, such as setting quest completion status or modifying quest progress
    during quest events. This method directly affects how quests are tracked and displayed
    to players, making it essential for proper quest handling.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) where the quest state should be set.
      This represents a specific position in the player's quest log.
  - name: state
    description: The quest state to set for the specified slot. Valid values include
      0 (not active), 1 (active), 2 (completed), and other state values depending
      on game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a quest as completed
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestSlotState(0, 2); // Set quest in slot 0 to completed state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a quest as active
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestSlotState(5, 1); // Set quest in slot 5 to active state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's quest log data structure. It should
    be used carefully as it affects how quests are displayed and tracked. The method
    is typically called during quest completion or progress updates, and may trigger
    updates to quest-related UI elements.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause quest progression issues or incorrect
    display of quest status in the player's quest log. Care should be taken when setting
    quest states to ensure they align with game mechanics and quest completion requirements.
