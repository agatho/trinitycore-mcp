documentation:
  brief: Returns the server-only flag value for the game object template.
  description: The GetServerOnly method retrieves the server-only flag associated
    with a GameObjectTemplate instance. This flag determines whether the game object
    should only be spawned and managed on the server side, without any client-side
    representation or interaction. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this is typically used for objects that serve purely as server-side triggers,
    data containers, or internal game mechanics elements that do not require client
    rendering or user interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the server-only flag. A value of 0
    indicates the object has no server-only restrictions, while any non-zero value
    signifies that the object should be treated as server-only and not sent to clients.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject is Server-Only
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate->GetServerOnly() != 0)\n{\n    // This object should only exist\
      \ on the server\n    sLog->outString(\"GameObject 12345 is server-only\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The server-only flag is typically set during database loading or template
    initialization. It's important to note that objects marked as server-only will
    not be sent to clients through the GameObjectData packet, which can significantly
    reduce network traffic for certain types of game objects.
