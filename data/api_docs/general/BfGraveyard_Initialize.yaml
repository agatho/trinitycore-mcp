documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Battlefield Graveyard with specified control and graveyard
    IDs
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state of a Battlefield Graveyard
    object by assigning it a starting control ID and graveyard ID. This method is
    typically called during the initialization phase of a battlefield scenario to
    properly configure the graveyard's properties. The control ID likely represents
    the initial controlling faction or team, while the graveyard ID identifies the
    specific graveyard within the battlefield system. This setup is essential for
    proper graveyard functionality in battlegrounds such as those found in World of
    Warcraft's Battlefield system.
  parameters:
  - name: startcontrol
    description: The initial control ID that determines which faction or team currently
      controls this graveyard
  - name: gy
    description: The graveyard ID that uniquely identifies this specific graveyard
      within the battlefield system
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'BfGraveyard graveyard;

      graveyard.Initialize(2, 15);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization in Battlefield Context
    code: "void SetupBattlefieldGraveyards()\n{\n    BfGraveyard graveyard1;\n   \
      \ graveyard1.Initialize(0, 1);\n    \n    BfGraveyard graveyard2;\n    graveyard2.Initialize(1,\
      \ 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during object initialization. The
    parameters are typically set based on battlefield configuration data loaded from
    database or hardcoded values for specific battlegrounds. This method does not
    perform any validation of the input parameters, so invalid IDs may lead to undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same object will overwrite previous
    values without warning. Ensure that startcontrol and gy values are valid identifiers
    within the battlefield system to avoid runtime errors or incorrect gameplay behavior.
