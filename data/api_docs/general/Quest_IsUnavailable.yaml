  class: Quest
  method: IsUnavailable
  signature: bool Quest::IsUnavailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is currently unavailable for player interaction.
  description: The IsUnavailable method checks if a quest has been marked as unavailable,
    typically due to quest completion, player level restrictions, or other game mechanics
    that prevent the quest from being accepted or completed. This method is commonly
    used in quest scripts and quest handling logic to determine if a quest should
    be skipped or ignored during quest progression. The method returns true when the
    quest is marked as unavailable, indicating it cannot be accepted or completed
    by the player at the current time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is currently unavailable for the player to accept
    or complete, false otherwise. This indicates that the quest has been marked as
    unavailable due to various game mechanics such as level requirements, completion
    status, or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (quest->IsUnavailable()) {\n    // Quest is not available for player\n\
      \    // Skip quest handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the player's level requirements, quest
    completion status, and other game mechanics that prevent quest acceptance. It
    should be used in conjunction with other quest validation methods to determine
    overall quest availability.
  warnings: This method does not account for all possible quest unavailability scenarios;
    it primarily focuses on basic quest completion and level restrictions. Other factors
    such as quest prerequisites or faction requirements may also affect quest availability.
