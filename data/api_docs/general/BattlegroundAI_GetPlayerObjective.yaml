  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetPlayerObjective
  signature: BGObjective BattlegroundAI::GetPlayerObjective(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground objective associated with a specified player.
  description: The GetPlayerObjective method is used to retrieve the BGObjective instance
    that corresponds to a specific player within a battleground. This method is typically
    employed by battleground AI systems to determine which objective a player is currently
    interacting with or assigned to. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the player's identifier and returns the corresponding battleground objective.
    It is important to note that this method may return a null or invalid objective
    if the player is not currently associated with any active battleground objective.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player GUID, otherwise the behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: Returns a BGObjective instance that represents the objective associated
    with the specified player. If no valid objective exists for the player, the method
    may return an invalid or null objective.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve player's battleground objective
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nBGObjective objective = bgAI->GetPlayerObjective(&playerId);\n\
      if (objective.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the objective\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ is assigned to objective: %d\\n\", objective.GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within battleground AI logic to track player
    objectives and manage game state. The method assumes that the provided player
    ID is valid and corresponds to an active player in the battleground.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a player currently participating in a battleground, otherwise the behavior
    may be undefined or lead to crashes.
