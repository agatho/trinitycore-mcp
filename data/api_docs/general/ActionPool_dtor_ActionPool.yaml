  method: ~ActionPool
  signature: void ActionPool::~ActionPool()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ActionPool instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ActionPool destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the ActionPool object. This includes releasing any
    internal data structures, freeing dynamically allocated memory, and ensuring that
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's AI
    system, ActionPool is typically used to manage a collection of actions that can
    be reused efficiently, and this destructor ensures proper cleanup when the pool
    is no longer needed. The destructor should be called automatically by the C++
    runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of ActionPool
    code: 'ActionPool* pool = new ActionPool();

      // ... use the pool ...

      delete pool; // Triggers ~ActionPool destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ActionPool pool;\n    // ... use pool ...\n\
      \    // ~ActionPool called automatically when pool goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime and should not
    be called manually. It's important to ensure that all references to actions within
    the pool are properly invalidated before destruction to prevent use-after-free
    errors. The implementation likely includes cleanup of internal linked lists or
    memory pools used for action management.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor as it will lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure no other code holds references to actions managed by this pool before destruction,
    as this could cause dangling pointer issues.
