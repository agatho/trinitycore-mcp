  signature: void ReputationMgr::SendVisible(const FactionState * faction, bool visible)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visibility state of a faction for the player's reputation display.
  description: The SendVisible method controls whether a specific faction appears
    in the player's reputation list within the game client. It sends a packet to the
    client indicating whether the faction should be visible or hidden. This method
    is typically used during faction initialization, reputation changes, or when factions
    are dynamically added or removed from the player's view. The visibility state
    affects how the faction appears in the character's reputation tab and influences
    the display of related quest markers or NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: faction
    description: Pointer to the FactionState object representing the faction whose
      visibility is being set. Must not be null.
  - name: visible
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the faction should be visible (true)
      or hidden (false) in the player's reputation list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Make a Faction Visible
    code: "ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nFactionState const*\
      \ faction = repMgr->GetFactionState(1234);\nif (faction)\n{\n    repMgr->SendVisible(faction,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Hide a Faction from Reputation List
    code: "ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nFactionState const*\
      \ faction = repMgr->GetFactionState(5678);\nif (faction)\n{\n    repMgr->SendVisible(faction,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly communicates with the client through network packets.
    It should only be called when the player is in a valid state to receive updates.
    The faction parameter must point to a valid FactionState object that has been
    initialized in the reputation manager.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null faction pointer will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the faction exists and is properly initialized
    before calling SendVisible. Avoid frequent calls to this method during rapid reputation
    changes as it may impact performance.
