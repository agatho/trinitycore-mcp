  method: PrioritizeHealers
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::PrioritizeHealers()
documentation:
  brief: Configures the behavior manager to prioritize healing targets based on threat
    and health status.
  description: The PrioritizeHealers method adjusts the targeting logic of the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    to focus on healing allies who are either under significant threat or have low
    health. This method is typically used in AI-controlled scenarios where maintaining
    group survivability is critical. It modifies internal target selection criteria
    to ensure that healers are directed toward the most vulnerable party members first,
    improving overall raid or group performance during combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.PrioritizeHealers();

      // AI now prioritizes healing targets based on threat and health status'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating combat or when entering a
    new phase of encounter. It modifies the internal state of the behavior manager,
    so calling it multiple times may have unintended side effects if not properly
    managed.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat without ensuring that the
    AI has sufficient time to re-evaluate targets. Improper usage can lead to unexpected
    behavior in complex encounters where target priority is already defined by other
    systems.
