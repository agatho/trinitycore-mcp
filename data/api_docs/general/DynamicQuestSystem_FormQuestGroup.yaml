  method: FormQuestGroup
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::FormQuestGroup(uint32 questId, Player * initiator)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to form a quest group for the specified quest and initiator player.
  description: The FormQuestGroup method is responsible for creating or initializing
    a quest group associated with a specific quest ID and player initiator. This functionality
    is typically used in dynamic quest systems where quests can be grouped together
    for collaborative gameplay, such as shared objectives or coordinated multi-player
    activities. The method evaluates whether the quest can be grouped and if the initiator
    meets the necessary conditions to start the group. It handles internal state management
    for quest groups and may trigger related quest events or notifications upon successful
    formation.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which a group is being formed.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: initiator
    description: Pointer to the Player object that initiates the quest group formation.
      This player must be online and within valid range for quest operations.
  returns: Returns true if the quest group was successfully formed, false otherwise.
    Failure may occur due to invalid quest ID, insufficient permissions, or already
    existing group state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Group Formation
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem->FormQuestGroup(12345, player)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ group successfully formed\n    player->SendNotification(\"Quest group created!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to form quest group\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to create quest group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Group with Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* initiator = player;\nif (initiator &&\
      \ initiator->IsInWorld()) {\n    if (dynamicQuestSystem->FormQuestGroup(questId,\
      \ initiator)) {\n        // Additional logic for successful group formation\n\
      \        LOG_INFO(\"quest\", \"Player {} formed quest group for quest {}\",\
      \ initiator->GetName(), questId);\n    } else {\n        // Handle failure case\n\
      \        LOG_ERROR(\"quest\", \"Failed to form quest group for player {} and\
      \ quest {}\", initiator->GetName(), questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    require the quest to be enabled in the game's quest database. It is recommended
    to validate that the player is in a valid state (online, not in combat) before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the quest ID or player
    state can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the quest exists
    and the player is eligible to form groups for it.
