  method: GetCUFProfile
  signature: CUFProfile * Player::GetCUFProfile(uint8 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the CUF profile for the specified player ID
  description: This method retrieves a CUF (Cast Unit Frame) profile associated with
    a specific player ID. CUF profiles are used to manage player-specific unit frame
    configurations and settings within the TrinityCore framework. The method allows
    access to player-specific data that defines how unit frames should behave for
    different players, including their display settings, health bars, mana bars, and
    other visual elements. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    player unit frame behavior in World of Warcraft client implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CUFProfile object associated with the specified
    player ID, or nullptr if no profile exists for that ID
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "CUFProfile* profile = player->GetCUFProfile(0);\nif (profile)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use profile data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other CUF-related methods
    to manage player unit frame configurations. The implementation may involve caching
    mechanisms for performance optimization.
  warnings: Care should be taken when accessing CUF profiles, as improper handling
    can lead to display issues or crashes if the profile data becomes invalid or corrupted.
