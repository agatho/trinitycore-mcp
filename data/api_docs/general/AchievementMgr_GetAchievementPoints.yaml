documentation:
  brief: Returns the total achievement points earned by the player
  description: The GetAchievementPoints method retrieves the cumulative achievement
    point total for the player associated with this AchievementMgr instance. In World
    of Warcraft, achievement points are awarded when players complete various achievements,
    and these points contribute to their overall character progression and reputation
    within the game. This value is typically used for displaying the player's achievement
    score in UI elements, determining eligibility for certain rewards, or calculating
    bonuses based on achievement milestones. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of achievement points earned
    by the player. This value will be zero if no achievements have been earned yet,
    or a positive integer reflecting the sum of all earned achievement point values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 points = player->GetAchievementMgr()->GetAchievementPoints();

      printf("Player has %u achievement points\n", points);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Achievement Points in UI
    code: "void DisplayPlayerAchievementPoints(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 points\
      \ = player->GetAchievementMgr()->GetAchievementPoints();\n    if (points > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"You have\
      \ earned %u achievement points.\", points);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"You have not earned any\
      \ achievement points yet.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during UI updates or when calculating
    player statistics. The returned value reflects all achievements that have been
    completed and properly rewarded, including those from previous sessions. The AchievementMgr
    instance must be valid and associated with an active player object for this method
    to return meaningful data.
  warnings: Do not assume that achievement points are directly correlated with the
    number of achievements completed; different achievements may award varying point
    values. Also, ensure that the player's AchievementMgr is properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid accessing invalid memory or returning unexpected
    results.
