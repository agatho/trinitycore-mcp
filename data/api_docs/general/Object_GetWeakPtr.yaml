  method: GetWeakPtr
  signature: int Object::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer value of the object, used for tracking object references
    in the game world.
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the weak pointer value associated with
    an Object instance, which is essential for managing object references and preventing
    memory leaks in TrinityCore's object system. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other object management functions to track the lifecycle of objects within
    the game world. The weak pointer value helps determine if an object is still valid
    and accessible, particularly when dealing with pointers that may become invalid
    due to object destruction or garbage collection. It is important to note that
    this method does not directly return a GUID or identifier but rather provides
    a reference count or tracking mechanism for the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the weak pointer count or reference
    tracking value of the object, which indicates how many references are currently
    pointing to this object. A value of 0 typically means no active references exist,
    while higher values indicate more active references.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      int weakPtrValue = obj->GetWeakPtr();

      printf("Weak pointer value: %d\n", weakPtrValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for internal tracking purposes within TrinityCore's
    object system. It should not be used directly for identifying objects or their
    GUIDs, as it serves a different purpose than the standard GetGUID() method. Performance
    considerations include potential overhead when frequently calling this method
    in loops or high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other object identification methods
    like GetGUID(). Using this method incorrectly can lead to improper tracking of
    object references and potentially cause memory leaks or invalid memory access
    if used inappropriately. Always ensure proper reference management when using
    weak pointers.
