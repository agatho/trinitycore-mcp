  class: TargetSelector
  method: PredictTargetMovement
  signature: void TargetSelector::PredictTargetMovement(Unit * target, uint32 timeAheadMs,
    int & predictedPos)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of a target unit based on its current movement
    and time ahead.
  description: The PredictTargetMovement method calculates where a given unit will
    be located at a specified time in the future, taking into account the unit's current
    velocity and movement direction. This functionality is commonly used in AI behavior
    scripting to determine optimal targeting for spells or abilities that require
    anticipating enemy positions. The prediction accounts for the unit's movement
    type, speed, and direction to estimate its location after a given time interval.
    The method modifies an integer reference parameter to store the predicted position,
    which may be used for pathfinding, spell targeting, or combat decision-making
    in game AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose future movement is to be predicted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: timeAheadMs
    description: Time interval in milliseconds to predict ahead. Should be a positive
      integer value representing the time window for prediction.
  - name: predictedPos
    description: Reference to an integer that will store the predicted position result.
      The actual meaning of this value depends on implementation context but typically
      represents a coordinate or movement state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for AI targeting
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint predictedPosition = 0;\nTargetSelector\
      \ selector;\nselector.PredictTargetMovement(target, 1000, predictedPosition);\n\
      // Use predictedPosition to determine where the target will be in 1 second\n\
      if (predictedPosition > 0) {\n    // Proceed with targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is actively moving and has valid
    movement data. It may not work correctly for stationary or non-moving units. The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the precision of the unit's movement state information.
    Performance-wise, this operation is generally lightweight but can become more
    expensive if called frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing invalid time values (negative or extremely large) may lead to
    unpredictable behavior. The predicted position value should be interpreted carefully
    as its exact meaning depends on the implementation context within the TargetSelector
    class.
