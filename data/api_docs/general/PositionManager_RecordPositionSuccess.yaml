  signature: void PositionManager::RecordPositionSuccess(const int & pos, PositionType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Records a successful position update for the specified position type.
  description: The RecordPositionSuccess method is used to log or store information
    about a successful position update within the PositionManager class. This method
    takes a position identifier and a position type to record the success of a position-related
    operation, such as player movement or object placement. It likely updates internal
    tracking structures or logs to reflect that a given position has been successfully
    processed. The method is typically called after verifying that a position change
    or update was completed without errors, ensuring proper state management in the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier representing the location that was successfully
      updated. This value is typically an integer index or unique identifier for a
      specific position within the system.
  - name: type
    description: The type of position being recorded, indicating the category or context
      of the position update. This parameter likely defines how the position data
      should be interpreted or used in the game world.
  returns: null

    code: 'PositionManager manager;

      int playerPos = 12345;

      PositionType type = POSITION_TYPE_PLAYER;

    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Position Updates
    code: "PositionManager manager;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    manager.RecordPositionSuccess(i,\
      \ POSITION_TYPE_NPC);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger position management system in TrinityCore
    that tracks player and object positions. It may be used for synchronization purposes
    or to maintain consistency between client and server states.
