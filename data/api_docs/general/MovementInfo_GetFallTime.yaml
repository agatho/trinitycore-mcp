  class: MovementInfo
  method: GetFallTime
  signature: uint32 MovementInfo::GetFallTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time elapsed since the unit began falling.
  description: The GetFallTime method computes the duration in milliseconds that has
    passed since a unit (such as a player or creature) started its fall animation.
    This is typically used during movement updates to determine how long an object
    has been airborne, which affects physics-based behaviors like damage calculation,
    landing effects, and movement state transitions. The value returned represents
    the time since the fall began, not the total fall duration from height to ground
    impact.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds that has elapsed
    since the unit started falling. A return value of 0 indicates the unit is not
    currently in a falling state or the fall timer has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check fall duration
    code: "uint32 fallTime = movementInfo.GetFallTime();\nif (fallTime > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Unit is currently falling, process fall-related logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Unit has been falling for %u ms\", fallTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal movement state tracking and should only be
    called when the unit's movement info contains valid fall data. The implementation
    may use internal timers or frame-based calculations depending on how the MovementInfo
    object was updated.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value means the unit has completed
    its fall; it only indicates the time since the fall began. Also, calling this
    method outside of movement update contexts might return stale or invalid data.
