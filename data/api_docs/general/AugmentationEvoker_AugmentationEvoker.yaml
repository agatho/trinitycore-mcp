  class: AugmentationEvoker
  method: AugmentationEvoker
  signature: void AugmentationEvoker::AugmentationEvoker(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an AugmentationEvoker instance with a specified player bot.
  description: The AugmentationEvoker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AugmentationEvoker class, associating it with a specific Player object that acts
    as the bot. This method sets up internal state and references necessary for the
    evoker to perform augmentation-related actions within the TrinityCore framework.
    The player parameter represents the AI-controlled character that will be managed
    by this evoker instance. This constructor is typically called during the initialization
    phase of an AI system or when dynamically creating new evoker instances for specific
    bots.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this AugmentationEvoker
      will manage. Must not be null and should represent a valid player instance within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of AugmentationEvoker
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid Player object

      AugmentationEvoker evoker(myBot);

      // The evoker is now initialized and ready to manage the bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AugmentationEvoker in AI System Context
    code: "class MyAISystem {\npublic:\n    void InitializeBot(Player* player) {\n\
      \        AugmentationEvoker* evoker = new AugmentationEvoker(player);\n    \
      \    // Store reference for later use\n        botEvokers.push_back(evoker);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or network synchronization.
    It simply stores the provided player pointer and sets up basic internal references.
    The actual augmentation behavior is likely implemented in other methods of the
    class, not in this constructor.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this constructor remains valid
    for the lifetime of the AugmentationEvoker instance. Passing a null or invalid
    pointer will result in undefined behavior or crashes.
