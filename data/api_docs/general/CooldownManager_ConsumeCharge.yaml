  signature: void CooldownManager::ConsumeCharge(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a charge from the specified spell's cooldown timer
  description: The ConsumeCharge method reduces the charge count of a spell's cooldown
    by one. This function is typically used when a spell is cast or used, and it decrements
    the number of available charges for that spell. The method operates on the internal
    cooldown tracking system within the CooldownManager class, updating the remaining
    charges for the specified spell ID. If the spell does not have any charges remaining,
    this method will not perform any action. This mechanism supports abilities with
    limited uses per cooldown period such as trinkets or class abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to consume a charge.
      Must be a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume a charge from a spell cooldown
    code: "CooldownManager* cm = player->GetSpellHistory();\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\n\
      // Consume one charge from the spell with ID 12345\nif (cm)\n{\n    cm->ConsumeCharge(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if spell has charges before consuming
    code: "CooldownManager* cm = player->GetSpellHistory();\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\n\
      if (cm && cm->HasCharge(spellId))\n{\n    cm->ConsumeCharge(spellId);\n    //\
      \ Spell charge consumed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CooldownManager instance is properly initialized
    and that the spell ID corresponds to a valid spell in the game's database. The
    actual cooldown timer may not be affected unless the spell has a charge-based
    cooldown system. This function does not trigger any visual or auditory effects;
    it only modifies internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    spell entry. Calling this method with invalid spell IDs might lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect internal state management. Be cautious when using this in
    high-frequency contexts as it may impact performance if called excessively.
