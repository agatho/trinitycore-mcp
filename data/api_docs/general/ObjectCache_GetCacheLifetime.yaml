documentation:
  brief: Returns the cache lifetime value for the ObjectCache instance
  description: The GetCacheLifetime method retrieves the configured lifetime duration
    (in seconds) for objects stored within this ObjectCache instance. This value determines
    how long cached objects remain valid before they are considered expired and potentially
    removed from the cache. The cache lifetime is typically set during object initialization
    or configuration and affects the performance and memory usage of cached data.
    This method provides read-only access to the internal cache lifetime setting without
    modifying it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the cache lifetime in seconds. This indicates
    how long objects will remain cached before expiration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log cache lifetime
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetGlobalCache();

      uint32 lifetime = cache->GetCacheLifetime();

      TC_LOG_INFO("cache", "Cache lifetime is %u seconds", lifetime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    value represents the configured lifetime and may be used to determine cache behavior
    or for debugging purposes.
