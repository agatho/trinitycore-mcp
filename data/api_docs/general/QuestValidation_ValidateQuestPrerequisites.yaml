  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestPrerequisites
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestPrerequisites(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all prerequisites for accepting a quest.
  description: The ValidateQuestPrerequisites method checks if a given player has
    met all necessary conditions to accept a specific quest. This includes verifying
    that the player's level is within the acceptable range, that they have not already
    completed the quest, and that any required previous quests have been fulfilled.
    The method also ensures that the player meets faction requirements and that the
    quest is not restricted by other game mechanics such as daily limits or quest
    gating. It returns true if all prerequisites are satisfied, allowing the quest
    to be accepted, or false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must correspond to
      a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      prerequisites are being validated. Must not be null.
  returns: True if all prerequisites for the quest are met and the player can accept
    it; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ValidateQuestPrerequisites
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->ValidateQuestPrerequisites(12345, player)) {\n  \
      \  // Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player cannot accept the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do\
      \ not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple database lookups and checks, so it should be
    used judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks. It is typically called before
    allowing a player to accept a quest in order to prevent invalid quest acceptance.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that this method does not modify the player's state; it only validates
    conditions.
