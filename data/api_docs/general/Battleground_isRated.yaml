documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground is a rated match.
  description: The isRated method checks if the current battleground instance is configured
    as a rated match. In World of Warcraft's Battleground system, rated matches are
    those that contribute to players' arena or battleground ratings and affect their
    seasonal rankings. This method returns true if the battleground is part of a rated
    competition, such as Rated Battlegrounds (RBGs) or rated arena matches, and false
    otherwise. The result is typically determined during battleground creation and
    initialization based on game mode settings and player eligibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battleground is a rated match, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the match contributes to player ratings and rankings.
  examples:
  - title: Check if battleground is rated before starting
    code: "if (bg->isRated())\n{\n    // Apply rated match specific logic\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_STARTED_RATED,\
      \ bg->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle normal match logic\n  \
      \  sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_STARTED_NORMAL, bg->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in battleground start and end logic to determine
    if rewards should be adjusted for rated matches. The result is set during battleground
    initialization and does not change during the match duration.
