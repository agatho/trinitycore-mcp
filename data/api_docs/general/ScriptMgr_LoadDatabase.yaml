documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all script-related data from the database into memory
    for use by the TrinityCore server.
  description: The LoadDatabase method is responsible for initializing the script
    management system by loading all relevant script data from the game's database.
    This includes loading creature scripts, game object scripts, quest scripts, and
    other scripted elements that are defined in the database tables. The method typically
    runs during server startup or when scripts need to be reloaded dynamically. It
    ensures that all script definitions are properly parsed and stored in memory so
    they can be referenced during gameplay events. This method is crucial for maintaining
    consistency between the database definitions and the runtime behavior of scripted
    elements in the game world.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sScriptMgr->LoadDatabase();\n\
      \    // Continue with server startup...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete script reload is required. It's typically invoked automatically by
    the core server initialization process, but may also be manually triggered in
    development environments for hot-reloading scripts. The method performs database
    queries and memory allocations, so it should not be called frequently during normal
    gameplay operations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate script registrations. This method should never be invoked
    from within high-frequency event handlers as it may block the main thread while
    performing database operations.
