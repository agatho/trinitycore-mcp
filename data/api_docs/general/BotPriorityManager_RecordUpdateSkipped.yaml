  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: RecordUpdateSkipped
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::RecordUpdateSkipped(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Records that a bot update was skipped for the specified bot GUID.
  description: The RecordUpdateSkipped method logs an event indicating that an update
    operation for a specific bot was not performed. This typically occurs when the
    bot's state or conditions prevent it from being updated at that time. The method
    is used for tracking and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore bot management
    system, helping to identify why certain bots may not be processing updates as
    expected. It does not perform any direct actions on the bot itself but maintains
    internal records of skipped operations.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the update was
      skipped. This value should correspond to a valid bot entry in the system's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Skipped Update
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      manager->RecordUpdateSkipped(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other bot management functions
    to maintain a log of update operations. It may be called internally by the system
    when certain conditions are not met, such as when a bot is offline or in an invalid
    state.
