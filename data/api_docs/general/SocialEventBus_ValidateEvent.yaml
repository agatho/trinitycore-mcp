  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool SocialEventBus::ValidateEvent(const SocialEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a social event is properly formatted and meets all required
    criteria for processing.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given SocialEvent object contains
    valid data and adheres to the expected structure and constraints defined by the
    SocialEventBus. It ensures that all necessary fields are present, properly initialized,
    and within acceptable ranges or formats. This validation is crucial before an
    event is processed or broadcasted in the game world to prevent malformed events
    from causing errors or unexpected behavior. The method performs checks on event
    type, target identifiers, timestamps, and other relevant properties to guarantee
    data integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The SocialEvent object to be validated. This parameter must be a
      valid reference to a SocialEvent instance containing all required fields with
      appropriate values.
  returns: Returns true if the event passes all validation checks and is considered
    valid; otherwise, returns false if any validation criteria are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Validation
    code: "SocialEventBus bus;\nSocialEvent event;\n// Populate event with valid data\n\
      bool isValid = bus.ValidateEvent(event);\nif (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ event handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Processing Pipeline
    code: "void ProcessSocialEvent(const SocialEvent& incomingEvent) {\n    SocialEventBus\
      \ bus;\n    if (!bus.ValidateEvent(incomingEvent)) {\n        // Log error and\
      \ discard invalid event\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid social event received\"\
      );\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with valid event processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the SocialEventBus before any
    event is dispatched to subscribers. It's important to note that validation may
    involve checking against current game state or configuration settings, so performance
    could be impacted if extensive checks are performed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or partially constructed SocialEvent
    object may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect validation results. Always
    ensure the event is properly initialized before calling ValidateEvent.
