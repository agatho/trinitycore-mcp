  method: Update
  signature: bool IdleMovementGenerator::Update(int * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the idle movement generator state and returns whether the movement
    is still active.
  description: The Update method of IdleMovementGenerator is responsible for managing
    the state of an idle movement behavior in the game AI system. It typically handles
    the logic for how a creature or unit behaves when it is not actively moving towards
    a target, such as standing still or performing minor idle animations. This method
    is called periodically during the AI update cycle to ensure that the idle movement
    remains consistent with the current game state and conditions. The return value
    indicates whether the idle movement should continue or if it has completed its
    intended behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the idle movement is still active and should continue,
    false otherwise. This typically occurs when the movement has finished or when
    external conditions have caused the generator to stop.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateAI(diff))\n \
      \       return;\n\n    if (m_idleMovementGenerator)\n    {\n        if (!m_idleMovementGenerator->Update(nullptr,\
      \ 0))\n        {\n            // Idle movement completed, reset or switch to\
      \ another behavior\n            m_idleMovementGenerator = nullptr;\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update loop and should
    not be called directly unless you are implementing custom movement logic. The
    IdleMovementGenerator may internally track time or other conditions to determine
    when to stop the idle behavior.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of true means the unit is actively moving;
    it simply indicates that the idle movement generator is still active. Also, ensure
    that the generator is properly initialized before calling Update to avoid undefined
    behavior.
