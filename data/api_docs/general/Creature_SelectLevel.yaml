  method: SelectLevel
  signature: void Creature::SelectLevel()
documentation:
  brief: Selects the appropriate level for the creature based on its entry ID and
    current world state.
  description: The SelectLevel method determines and sets the correct level for a
    Creature object based on its creature entry ID and the current game world state.
    This method is typically used during creature initialization or when the creature's
    level needs to be adjusted dynamically. It ensures that the creature's level matches
    the expected level for its specific entry, which may vary depending on the difficulty
    settings, player level range, or other game mechanics. The method does not directly
    change the creature's level but rather selects an appropriate level from a predefined
    set of possible levels based on the creature's entry configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SelectLevel();

      // This sets the creature''s level to match its entry configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during creature creation or initialization.
    It may involve checking against multiple possible levels depending on the creature's
    entry ID and current world state. The implementation likely uses internal data
    structures that map creature entries to appropriate level ranges.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where the creature's level
    needs to be manually overridden or adjusted, as it may override any custom level
    settings. It is important to understand that this method does not directly set
    the creature's level but rather selects a level from a predefined set of possible
    levels.
