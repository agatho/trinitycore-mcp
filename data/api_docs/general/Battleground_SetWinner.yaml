  class: Battleground
  method: SetWinner
  signature: void Battleground::SetWinner(int winnerTeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the winning team for a battleground instance.
  description: The SetWinner method is used to designate which team has won a battleground
    match. This method updates the internal state of the battleground to reflect the
    victory, triggering necessary cleanup and reward distribution processes. It typically
    gets called when the battleground ends due to one team achieving victory conditions
    or when the match is manually terminated with a winner declared. The method does
    not directly handle player rewards or experience gains; instead, it signals to
    the system that a winner exists so that appropriate actions can be taken during
    the battleground's cleanup phase.
  parameters:
  - name: winnerTeamId
    description: An integer representing the team ID of the winning side. Valid values
      are typically 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde, or -1 to indicate no winner or a
      draw.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Declare Alliance as Winner
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetWinner(0); // 0 represents Alliance\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Declare Horde as Winner
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetWinner(1); // 1 represents Horde\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the battleground is in a state where
    it can accept a winner, typically after all objectives have been completed or
    when the match has ended. Calling this method outside of proper game flow may
    result in inconsistent behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Do not call SetWinner with invalid team IDs (e.g., values other than 0,
    1, or -1) unless you are certain about the internal structure of the battleground
    system. Incorrect usage can lead to undefined behavior.
