documentation:
  brief: Initiates looting of a game object, processing its loot and adding items
    to the player's inventory.
  description: The LootGameObject method is responsible for handling the looting process
    of a GameObject, such as a chest or corpse. It evaluates the loot template associated
    with the game object, generates the appropriate loot items, and adds them to the
    player's inventory. This method typically gets called when a player interacts
    with a lootable object. The method checks if the player has permission to loot
    the object and ensures that the loot is properly distributed according to the
    game's loot rules. It returns true if the looting process was successful and false
    otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the looting process was successfully initiated and items
    were added to the inventory, or false if there was an error during the looting
    process or if no loot was available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LootGameObject
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->LootGameObject(chest)) {\n    // Loot was successful\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"You have looted the chest.\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // No loot or error occurred\n    player->SendNotification(\"Nothing to\
      \ loot here.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a player has valid access to loot
    the GameObject. It assumes that all necessary permission checks have been performed
    before calling this function. The actual item distribution happens asynchronously
    in some cases, depending on the server's configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObject pointer passed is valid and not null. Calling
    this method without proper authorization may result in unexpected behavior or
    security issues. Also, note that this method does not handle quest-related loot
    or special loot conditions; those are handled separately by other systems.
