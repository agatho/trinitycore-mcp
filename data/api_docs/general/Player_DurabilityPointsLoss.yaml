  signature: void Player::DurabilityPointsLoss(Item * item, int32 points)
documentation:
  brief: Removes durability points from an item when player's durability is reduced.
  description: This method handles the reduction of durability points from a specified
    item when a player's durability system is affected. It typically occurs during
    gameplay when items lose durability due to damage or wear, and it ensures proper
    handling of item durability loss mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. The
    method is designed to work with the player's current durability state and item's
    durability status.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object whose durability points are being reduced.
      This represents the specific item that will lose durability points.
  - name: points
    description: Integer value representing the amount of durability points to be
      removed from the item. This value can be positive or negative depending on whether
      durability is being increased or decreased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->DurabilityPointsLoss(item, 10);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal durability system handling in TrinityCore.
    It should be used carefully as it directly affects item durability and may trigger
    item destruction if points reach zero. Performance considerations include avoiding
    frequent calls during combat or rapid damage scenarios.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item durability values,
    potentially causing items to break unexpectedly or behave erratically. The method
    should only be called when player's durability is actually being reduced, not
    during arbitrary situations.
