api:
  class: AuctionEvent
  method: AuctionWon
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::AuctionWon(int playerGuid, uint32 auctionId,
    uint32 itemId, uint64 bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionEvent object representing an auction win
    event for a player.
  description: The AuctionWon method is used to generate a new AuctionEvent instance
    that signifies a successful auction win by a player. This method takes in the
    player's unique identifier (GUID), the auction ID, the item ID won, and the bid
    amount paid. The returned AuctionEvent object can then be used for further processing
    such as updating player inventory, sending notifications, or logging auction activity.
    This method is typically invoked when an auction concludes and a bidder successfully
    wins the item, triggering the necessary game mechanics to finalize the transaction.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who won the auction. Must
      be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction that was won. This ID corresponds
      to an existing auction in the auction house system.
  - name: itemId
    description: The item ID of the item that was won in the auction. Must correspond
      to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The final bid amount paid by the winning player. This represents
      the gold value of the winning bid.
  returns: An AuctionEvent object representing the auction win event, containing all
    relevant information about the transaction including player GUID, auction ID,
    item ID, and bid amount.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AuctionWin Event Creation
    code: AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::AuctionWon(12345, 67890, 54321, 100000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AuctionWin Event in Auction Processing
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      uint32 auctionId = 67890;

      uint32 itemId = 54321;

      uint64 bidAmount = 100000;

      AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::AuctionWon(playerId, auctionId, itemId, bidAmount);

      // Process the event to update player inventory and send notification

      printf("Player %u won item %u in auction %u for %llu gold\n", playerId, itemId,
      auctionId, bidAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be a factory function that creates AuctionEvent
    objects. It does not perform any database operations or game state changes directly;
    it simply constructs the event object. The actual auction processing and player
    updates should be handled by calling methods on the AuctionHouseMgr or related
    systems after creating this event.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this method to
    prevent invalid events from being created. The playerGuid, auctionId, and itemId
    should correspond to valid entities in the game world to maintain data integrity.
