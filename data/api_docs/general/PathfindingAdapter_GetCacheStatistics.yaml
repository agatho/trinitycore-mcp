  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: GetCacheStatistics
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::GetCacheStatistics(uint32 & hits, uint32 & misses,
    uint32 & evictions) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cache hit, miss, and eviction statistics for pathfinding operations.
  description: The GetCacheStatistics method provides detailed performance metrics
    for the pathfinding cache within the PathfindingAdapter class. It populates three
    output parameters with counts representing how many pathfinding requests resulted
    in cache hits, misses, or evictions. This information is crucial for monitoring
    and optimizing pathfinding performance in World of Warcraft environments. The
    method does not modify any internal state and can be called at any time during
    runtime to assess cache efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: hits
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the number
      of successful cache hits during pathfinding operations.
  - name: misses
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the number
      of cache misses during pathfinding operations.
  - name: evictions
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the number
      of entries evicted from the cache during pathfinding operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 hits = 0, misses = 0, evictions = 0;

      pathfindingAdapter->GetCacheStatistics(hits, misses, evictions);

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Pathfinding Cache Stats - Hits: %u, Misses: %u, Evictions:
      %u", hits, misses, evictions);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void LogPathfindingCacheStats() {\n    uint32 hits = 0, misses = 0, evictions\
      \ = 0;\n    pathfindingAdapter->GetCacheStatistics(hits, misses, evictions);\n\
      \    float hitRatio = (hits + misses) > 0 ? static_cast<float>(hits) / (hits\
      \ + misses) : 0.0f;\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"pathfinding\", \"Cache Hit Ratio: %.2f%%\
      \ (Hits: %u, Misses: %u, Evictions: %u)\", \n                hitRatio * 100.0f,\
      \ hits, misses, evictions);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to internal cache statistics and does
    not perform any locking operations. It's safe to call from multiple threads concurrently,
    though the returned values may be inconsistent across calls due to concurrent
    modifications. The statistics are cumulative since the last reset or initialization
    of the pathfinding adapter.
  warnings: The returned statistics are not thread-safe and may change between the
    time they are read and when they are used in calculations. For accurate performance
    analysis, consider collecting these statistics at regular intervals or during
    specific testing phases rather than in real-time gameplay scenarios.
