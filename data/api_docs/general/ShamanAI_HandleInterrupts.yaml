  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleInterrupts(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles interrupting spell casts for the shaman AI by checking and managing
    target interruptions.
  description: The HandleInterrupts method in ShamanAI is responsible for managing
    spell interruption logic within the shaman's AI behavior. It evaluates whether
    a current spell cast should be interrupted based on various conditions such as
    incoming damage, target changes, or environmental factors. This method typically
    checks if the current target is valid and if any interrupts are pending or required.
    The method returns true if an interrupt was successfully handled, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper spell casting behavior in
    shaman AI during combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID that may be interrupted.
      This parameter is used internally by the method to determine if the current
      target requires interruption handling.
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt was successfully handled and processed, false
    if no interrupt occurred or if the interruption could not be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in shaman AI context
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleInterrupts(&targetId)) {\n    // Interrupt was handled\n\
      \    // Perform additional actions if needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void ShamanCombatAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n        int target = m_creature->GetVictim() ? m_creature->GetVictim()->GetGUIDLow()\
      \ : 0;\n        if (!HandleInterrupts(&target)) {\n            // Continue with\
      \ normal spell casting\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop for shaman units.
    It's important to note that this method may be called frequently during combat,
    so performance should be considered when implementing custom logic. The target
    parameter is typically passed by reference and modified internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the target ID passed to this method is valid before calling,
    as invalid targets could lead to undefined behavior. This method assumes proper
    initialization of the AI context and should not be called outside of a valid combat
    or AI execution context.
