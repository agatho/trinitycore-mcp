  method: GetCorpseTargetCountForEffect
  signature: int64 Spell::GetCorpseTargetCountForEffect(int effect) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of corpse targets for a specific spell effect.
  description: This method retrieves the number of corpse targets associated with
    a given spell effect. It is used in the context of spell mechanics to determine
    how many corpses are affected by a particular spell's effect, particularly in
    scenarios involving summoning or targeting effects. The method provides crucial
    information for understanding the behavior of spells that involve corpse-based
    targeting, such as those related to resurrection or summoning. This functionality
    is essential for proper spell handling and game mechanics implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the count of corpse targets for the specified effect. Returns
    zero if no corpse targets are found or if the effect does not involve corpse targeting.
    Negative values may indicate error conditions or invalid effect indices.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int64 corpseCount = spell->GetCorpseTargetCountForEffect(0);\nif (corpseCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the corpse targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine target counts for effects involving corpse summoning or resurrection.
    Performance considerations include checking effect validity before calling this
    method, as invalid effect indices may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: The method may return zero or negative values if the effect does not involve
    corpse targets or if the effect index is invalid. Care should be taken when using
    this method in conjunction with other spell functions to ensure proper effect
    handling and avoid potential errors.
