  brief: Shuts down the bot spawner system, cleaning up all active bot instances and
    related resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the BotSpawnerOptimized system by stopping
    all active bot spawning operations, releasing allocated memory, and ensuring proper
    cleanup of bot-related data structures. This method is typically invoked during
    server shutdown or when the bot spawning functionality needs to be temporarily
    disabled. It ensures that no bot instances remain active and that all associated
    resources are freed to prevent memory leaks. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no return value operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized* spawner = BotSpawnerOptimized::GetInstance();

      spawner->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a safe state to terminate
    bot operations. Calling Shutdown while bots are actively spawning or in combat
    may result in unexpected behavior or resource corruption.
