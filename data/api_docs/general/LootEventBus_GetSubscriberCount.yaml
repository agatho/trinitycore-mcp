  class: LootEventBus
  method: GetSubscriberCount
  signature: uint32 LootEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the LootEventBus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers to the LootEventBus. This event bus is used within TrinityCore to
    manage notifications and events related to loot distribution, such as when items
    are dropped, looted, or modified during gameplay. The returned value represents
    how many systems or components are currently listening for loot-related events.
    This method is typically used for debugging, monitoring, or performance analysis
    purposes to understand the event system's current load. The count includes all
    types of subscribers, regardless of their specific event type or subscription
    category.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the LootEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Subscriber Count
    code: 'uint32 subscriberCount = sLootEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("loot", "Current loot event subscribers: %u", subscriberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Event Bus Load During Development
    code: "void CheckLootEventBusLoad()\n{\n    uint32 count = sLootEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 100)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"loot\", \"High loot event\
      \ subscriber count detected: %u\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the internal subscriber
    count. The implementation likely uses atomic operations or appropriate locking
    mechanisms to ensure consistency when multiple threads may be modifying the subscriber
    list concurrently. This is important in a multi-threaded environment like TrinityCore
    where various systems might register/unregister from the event bus simultaneously.
  warnings: While this method itself is safe to call, relying on subscriber counts
    for critical gameplay logic could lead to race conditions if the count changes
    between when it's checked and when another operation is performed. Additionally,
    high subscriber counts may indicate performance bottlenecks or memory leaks in
    event handling systems.
