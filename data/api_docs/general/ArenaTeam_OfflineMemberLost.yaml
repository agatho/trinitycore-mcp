  class: ArenaTeam
  method: OfflineMemberLost
  signature: void ArenaTeam::OfflineMemberLost(int guid, uint32 againstMatchmakerRating,
    int32 MatchmakerRatingChange)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the removal of an offline member from an arena team and updates matchmaker
    rating.
  description: The OfflineMemberLost method is responsible for processing the scenario
    when a member of an arena team becomes offline, typically during a match or while
    the player is disconnected. This function updates internal tracking structures
    to reflect that the member is no longer available for active competition and adjusts
    the team's matchmaker rating accordingly. It ensures proper cleanup and state
    management within the arena team system, particularly in scenarios where players
    disconnect mid-match or are otherwise unavailable. The method is generally invoked
    by the core game logic when a player's connection is lost or their status changes
    to offline.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the offline arena team member who
      has left the match. This value identifies the specific player in the game world.
  - name: againstMatchmakerRating
    description: The matchmaker rating of the opposing team or player against which
      this member was competing. Used to calculate and adjust the team's overall rating.
  - name: MatchmakerRatingChange
    description: The change in matchmaker rating that should be applied to the arena
      team as a result of the offline member's departure. Positive values indicate
      rating gain, negative values indicate loss.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when handling offline player
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->OfflineMemberLost(56789, 1500, -50);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player disconnects during an arena match. It assumes that the arena team instance
    is valid and that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual member of the team.
    The internal state of the team must be consistent before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the arena team is properly initialized and that
    the member exists in the team before invoking this function.
