  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWorldObject(HighGuid type, uint8
    subType, uint32 realmId, uint16 mapId, uint32 serverId, uint32 entry, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a world object with specified type, realm,
    map, and counter values.
  description: The CreateWorldObject method generates a unique ObjectGuid identifier
    for a WorldObject in the TrinityCore framework. This method constructs a GUID
    using the provided parameters including the high GUID type, subtype, realm ID,
    map ID, server ID, entry ID, and a counter value. The resulting ObjectGuid is
    used internally by the game engine to uniquely identify objects such as creatures,
    game objects, items, and players within the world. The method ensures proper formatting
    of the GUID according to TrinityCore's object ID conventions, which are essential
    for maintaining consistency in object tracking, networking, and database operations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The HighGuid type indicating the category of the object (e.g., HIGHGUID_UNIT,
      HIGHGUID_GAMEOBJECT). This determines how the GUID is structured and interpreted
      by the game engine.
  - name: subType
    description: The subtype value that further specifies the object's classification
      within its high GUID category. Used for additional categorization of objects
      like different creature types or game object types.
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the object exists. This
      helps distinguish objects across different server realms in a multi-realm environment.
  - name: mapId
    description: The map identifier where the object is located. Used to determine
      which world map the object belongs to for spatial and zone-based operations.
  - name: serverId
    description: The server ID that identifies which specific server instance the
      object belongs to, useful in distributed server environments.
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the object, typically corresponding to a database
      entry that defines the object's properties and behavior.
  - name: counter
    description: A unique counter value used to ensure uniqueness among objects of
      the same type within the same realm. This value is incremented for each new
      object created.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid instance representing the unique identifier for the
    newly created world object. The GUID contains all necessary information to identify
    and track the object throughout the game world, including its type, realm, map,
    and instance-specific details.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Creature GUID
    code: ObjectGuid creatureGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWorldObject(HIGHGUID_UNIT,
      0, 1, 0, 0, 12345, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a GameObject GUID with Specific Parameters
    code: ObjectGuid goGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWorldObject(HIGHGUID_GAMEOBJECT,
      1, 1, 123, 0, 67890, 42);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during object creation when assigning unique
    identifiers to new world objects. The counter parameter should be managed carefully
    to prevent GUID collisions. The method assumes valid input parameters and does
    not perform validation checks on them.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the HighGuid type can lead to object identification
    errors in the game world. Ensure that realmId, mapId, and serverId values are
    properly set according to the current server configuration to avoid cross-realm
    or cross-map object conflicts.
