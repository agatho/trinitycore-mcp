  class: AuctionHouse
  method: AutoSellItems
  signature: void AuctionHouse::AutoSellItems(int * player, const int & itemGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically sells items from a player's inventory through the auction house
    system.
  description: The AutoSellItems method processes a list of item GUIDs and attempts
    to sell them on the auction house. This function is typically used by the game
    server to automate the selling of items that meet certain criteria, such as when
    an item is no longer needed or when a player's inventory is full. The method handles
    the creation of auction listings for each item, including setting appropriate
    bid prices and auction durations based on item type and value. It interacts with
    the auction house database to store auction data and updates the player's inventory
    accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's inventory items will be processed
      for auction.
  - name: itemGuids
    description: Reference to an integer containing the GUID of the item to be sold.
      This represents a single item being processed for automatic sale.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AutoSellItems Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      int itemGuid = 67890;

      AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      auctionHouse.AutoSellItems(&playerId, itemGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of a larger auction house
    system and may interact with database transactions. It's important to ensure that
    player inventory is properly validated before calling this function to avoid selling
    items that shouldn't be sold automatically.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unintended item sales or inventory
    corruption. The method should only be called when the player has sufficient permissions
    and when items are eligible for automatic sale according to game rules.
