documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can always see a specific object regardless of
    its visibility state.
  description: The CanAlwaysSee method checks if a player has the ability to always
    see a particular object, such as an item or NPC, even when it would normally be
    hidden or out of view. This method is typically used in scenarios where the player's
    visibility status needs to be overridden for gameplay purposes, such as during
    questing or when dealing with certain game mechanics that might otherwise restrict
    visibility. The method returns true if the player can see the object under all
    circumstances, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can always see the specified object; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanAlwaysSee(&obj)) {\n    // Player can see the object\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be used internally by TrinityCore to determine visibility
    overrides for objects in specific game contexts, such as when a player is performing
    a quest or interacting with NPCs. Performance considerations include potential
    overhead from checking visibility states, especially if used frequently.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as it may interfere with
    normal gameplay mechanics and visibility rules. Misuse could lead to unexpected
    behavior in game interactions or visual glitches.
