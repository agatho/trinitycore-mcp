  brief: Sends the list of known spells to the player's client
  description: This method transmits the complete list of spells that the player has
    learned or discovered to their client. It is used primarily during player initialization
    and when updating spell knowledge. The method ensures that the client receives
    accurate information about which spells are available to the player, including
    those that may have been learned through quest rewards or class abilities. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining proper spell tracking and preventing
    client-side inconsistencies in spell availability.
