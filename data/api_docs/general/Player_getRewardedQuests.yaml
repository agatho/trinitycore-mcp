documentation:
  brief: Returns the set of quests that have been rewarded to the player
  description: This method retrieves the collection of quests that have been completed
    and rewarded to the player. The returned set contains all quests that have been
    marked as rewarded in the player's quest log, typically after completing a quest
    or receiving quest rewards. This is useful for tracking quest completion status
    and managing quest-related game mechanics such as quest rewards, quest givers,
    and quest objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to a RewardedQuestSet which contains all the
    quests that have been rewarded to the player. The set is read-only and cannot
    be modified directly through this method.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetSession()->GetPlayer();\nconst RewardedQuestSet& rewardedQuests\
      \ = player->getRewardedQuests();\nfor (auto quest : rewardedQuests)\n{\n   \
      \ // Process rewarded quests\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's quest tracking system and should be used
    carefully when dealing with quest completion status. The returned set may not
    reflect all quests that have been completed, as it only includes those that have
    received rewards.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying quest data through this set, as it is read-only
    and any attempt to modify it directly will result in undefined behavior or errors.
