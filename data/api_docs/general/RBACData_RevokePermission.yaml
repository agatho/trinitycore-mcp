  signature: RBACCommandResult RBACData::RevokePermission(uint32 permissionId, int32
    realmId)
documentation:
  brief: Revokes a specific permission from the RBAC data for a given realm.
  description: The RevokePermission method removes a specified permission ID from
    the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) data structure for a particular realm. This
    function is used to strip permissions from players or groups within the TrinityCore
    framework, effectively revoking their access to specific game features or commands.
    The method operates on the RBAC system which controls player access rights and
    privileges in World of Warcraft servers. It requires a valid permission ID and
    realm ID to perform the revocation operation.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be revoked. This must
      correspond to a valid permission defined in the RBAC system.
  - name: realmId
    description: The realm identifier for which the permission should be revoked.
      Use -1 to apply to all realms, or specify a particular realm ID.
  returns: Returns an RBACCommandResult indicating the success or failure of the permission
    revocation operation. Possible values include RBAC_RESULT_SUCCESS, RBAC_RESULT_ERROR_INVALID_PERMISSION,
    RBAC_RESULT_ERROR_NO_PERMISSION, and others depending on the system's implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Revoke a specific permission for a realm
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      RBACCommandResult result = rbacData.RevokePermission(12345, 1); // Revokes permission
      ID 12345 for realm 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Revoke a permission across all realms
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      RBACCommandResult result = rbacData.RevokePermission(67890, -1); // Revokes
      permission ID 67890 for all realms'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal RBAC data structure and may require synchronization
    with the database to persist changes. The operation is typically used during runtime
    when adjusting player permissions, such as when a GM revokes access rights from
    a player. Ensure that permission IDs are valid before calling this function to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling RevokePermission with an invalid permission ID or realm ID may
    result in undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Always validate input
    parameters before invoking this method. Be cautious when revoking permissions
    for all realms (-1) as it affects the entire server configuration.
