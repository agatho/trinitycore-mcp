documentation:
  brief: Handles the taunt mechanic required for Vengeance Demon Hunter class behavior
  description: The OnTauntRequired method is invoked when a Vengeance Demon Hunter
    AI needs to execute a taunt ability. This method typically manages the targeting
    logic and ensures that the demon hunter properly applies taunt effects on a specified
    target. The method may be triggered by various game events such as enemy aggro
    changes, specific spell casts, or AI decision-making processes within the TrinityCore
    framework. It is designed to maintain proper combat mechanics and class-specific
    abilities for the Vengeance Demon Hunter specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier that will
      be subjected to taunt effect. The value should correspond to a valid GameObject
      or Unit GUID within the current map context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Execution
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::OnTauntRequired(int* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (target && *target != 0)\n    {\n        // Apply taunt effect to the\
      \ specified target\n        Unit* unitTarget = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_creature,\
      \ *target);\n        if (unitTarget)\n        {\n            m_creature->TauntApply(unitTarget);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI is in a combat state and has
    valid target information. Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit
    or game object before attempting to apply taunt mechanics.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter may result in invalid memory
    access or failed taunt application. Always validate the target pointer and its
    referenced value before using it in taunt operations.
