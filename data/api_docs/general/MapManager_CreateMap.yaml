  class: MapManager
  method: CreateMap
  signature: Map * MapManager::CreateMap(uint32 mapId, Player * player, int lfgDungeonsId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new Map instance for the specified map ID, optionally
    associating it with a player and LFG dungeon ID.
  description: The CreateMap method is responsible for instantiating a new Map object
    for a given map identifier. It serves as a factory method within the MapManager
    class to handle the creation of game maps, which are essential components for
    managing player movement, world interactions, and zone-specific gameplay mechanics.
    The method accepts an optional player reference and LFG dungeon ID, which may
    be used to configure the map's initial state or associate it with specific group
    activities such as dungeons or raids. This functionality is crucial for dynamic
    map loading in TrinityCore's world management system, particularly when players
    enter new zones or join group content.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map to be created. This corresponds
      to the Map ID used internally by TrinityCore to distinguish different game zones
      and instances.
  - name: player
    description: Optional pointer to a Player object that will be associated with
      the newly created map. This may be used for player-specific map initialization
      or context.
  - name: lfgDungeonsId
    description: Optional integer representing the LFG (Looking For Group) dungeon
      ID, which can be used to configure the map for specific group content or instance
      types.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created Map object if successful. Returns nullptr
    if the map could not be created due to invalid parameters or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Creation
    code: Map* map = sMapMgr->CreateMap(1, nullptr, 0); // Create a new instance of
      map ID 1
    language: cpp
  - title: Map Creation with Player Context
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      Map* map = sMapMgr->CreateMap(530, player, 1234); // Create map 530 for player
      in LFG dungeon 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a new map instance needs to be created.
    The returned Map object must be properly managed by the caller, as it is not automatically
    tracked or destroyed by the MapManager. Ensure that the mapId is valid and corresponds
    to an existing map definition in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid mapId may result in undefined behavior
    or a null pointer return. Always validate the returned Map pointer before using
    it. Avoid calling CreateMap repeatedly without proper cleanup, as this can lead
    to memory leaks.
