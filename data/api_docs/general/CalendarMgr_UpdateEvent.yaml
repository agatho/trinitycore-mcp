  class: CalendarMgr
  method: UpdateEvent
  signature: void CalendarMgr::UpdateEvent(CalendarEvent * calendarEvent)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a calendar event's data in the database and notifies all attendees
    of changes.
  description: The UpdateEvent method synchronizes changes made to a CalendarEvent
    object with the database storage. It ensures that any modifications to event details
    such as title, description, date, or invite status are persisted and propagated
    to all affected players. This method is typically invoked when an event organizer
    modifies an existing calendar event, triggering updates to the event's state in
    the game world. The method handles both local caching and database persistence
    for the updated event data.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: Pointer to the CalendarEvent object that needs to be updated in the
      system. Must not be null and should represent a valid, existing calendar event.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Update an existing calendar event
    code: "CalendarEvent* myEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (myEvent)\n\
      {\n    myEvent->SetTitle(\"Updated Meeting\");\n    sCalendarMgr->UpdateEvent(myEvent);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles database transactions and may trigger network
    packets to inform all attendees about the update. It's recommended to ensure that
    the CalendarEvent object is fully initialized before calling this method to prevent
    data inconsistency.
  warnings: Calling UpdateEvent with a null pointer will likely result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always validate that the calendarEvent parameter is not
    null before invoking this method.
