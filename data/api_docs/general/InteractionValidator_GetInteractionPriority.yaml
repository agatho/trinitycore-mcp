  class: InteractionValidator
  method: GetInteractionPriority
  signature: int32 InteractionValidator::GetInteractionPriority(::Player * bot, InteractionType
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the priority level for a specified interaction type with a given
    player bot.
  description: The GetInteractionPriority method evaluates and returns an integer
    priority value for a specific interaction type involving a player bot. This priority
    is used internally by the AI system to determine the order of operations or focus
    during interactions. The method takes into account various factors such as the
    bot's current state, the type of interaction requested, and contextual relevance
    to assign a numerical priority. It is typically called within decision-making
    loops where prioritization of actions is required for proper behavior sequencing.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the interaction
      priority is being evaluated.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of interaction (e.g., gossip,
      quest, vendor) for which the priority is determined.
  returns: An int32 value representing the calculated priority level. Higher values
    indicate higher priority; negative values may denote low or disabled priority.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 priority = validator.GetInteractionPriority(bot, InteractionType::GOSSIP);\n\
      if (priority > 0) {\n    // Proceed with the interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority in Decision Logic
    code: "auto bot = player->GetBot();\nint32 gossipPriority = validator.GetInteractionPriority(bot,\
      \ InteractionType::GOSSIP);\nint32 questPriority = validator.GetInteractionPriority(bot,\
      \ InteractionType::QUEST);\nif (gossipPriority > questPriority) {\n    // Handle\
      \ gossip interaction first\n} else {\n    // Handle quest interaction first\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI interaction validation system and relies on
    internal state tracking of the bot. It should be called only when the bot's state
    is stable to ensure accurate priority calculation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as accessing
    an invalid bot may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that
    the interaction type enum values are properly initialized and recognized by the
    system.
