  signature: void HunterAI::RecordShotResult(bool hit, bool crit)
documentation:
  brief: Records the result of a hunter's shot attack, including hit and critical
    strike status for AI tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordShotResult method is used by the HunterAI class to log the
    outcome of a hunter's ranged attack. This method updates internal tracking data
    that may be used for various AI behaviors, such as adjusting aim, calculating
    damage multipliers, or determining next action sequences. The method accepts two
    boolean parameters indicating whether the shot hit the target and whether it was
    a critical strike. This information is crucial for maintaining accurate combat
    statistics and AI decision-making within the hunter's behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: hit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the hunter's shot successfully hit
      the target. True if the attack connected, false if it missed.
  - name: crit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the hunter's shot was a critical
      strike. True if the attack was a critical hit, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a successful non-critical shot
    code: hunterAI->RecordShotResult(true, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a critical hit
    code: hunterAI->RecordShotResult(true, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a hunter's
    shot completes its animation and determines the outcome. It should not be invoked
    manually unless implementing custom AI behavior or testing scenarios.
