documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently in the process of being resurrected.
  description: The IsResurrecting method determines whether a player character is
    currently undergoing the resurrection process, typically triggered by a priest's
    resurrection spell or similar mechanics. This method returns true when the player
    is in a state where they are being revived from death, and false otherwise. The
    check is usually performed during the resurrection animation and transition period
    before the player becomes fully alive again. This functionality is integral to
    handling game state transitions and preventing certain actions while a character
    is being resurrected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in the process of being resurrected,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check resurrection state
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->IsResurrecting()) {\n    // Player\
      \ is being resurrected\n    // Prevent certain actions during this time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal player state flags or timers related
    to resurrection mechanics. It may be used in conjunction with other death-related
    APIs to manage player transitions between alive and dead states.
