  method: SetAnimation
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetAnimation(AnimTier anim, uint32 tierTransitionId,
    int transitionStartTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the animation tier and transition parameters for a spline movement.
  description: The SetAnimation method configures the animation settings for a MoveSplineInit
    object, determining how the character's movement animation should behave during
    spline-based locomotion. This includes specifying the animation tier (AnimTier)
    which defines the type of movement animation, a transition ID to manage state
    transitions between different animation states, and a start time for the transition.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related systems to ensure
    that character animations properly synchronize with their physical movement paths.
    It's important to note that this method modifies internal spline animation parameters
    but does not immediately trigger any animation changes; it prepares the configuration
    for subsequent movement execution.
  parameters:
  - name: anim
    description: The animation tier (AnimTier) that defines the type of movement animation
      to be used. This parameter determines the visual behavior of the character's
      movement, such as walking, running, flying, or swimming animations.
  - name: tierTransitionId
    description: An identifier for the animation transition state. This value is used
      to manage transitions between different animation tiers and helps maintain proper
      animation sequencing during movement changes.
  - name: transitionStartTime
    description: The start time offset (in milliseconds) for the animation transition.
      This parameter controls when the transition from one animation state to another
      should begin, allowing for precise timing of animation switches during movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Animation Setup
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetAnimation(AnimTier::Walk, 1001, 0);

      // Prepares a walking animation with transition ID 1001 starting immediately'
    language: cpp
  - title: Running Animation with Delayed Transition
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetAnimation(AnimTier::Run, 1002, 500);

      // Sets up a running animation with transition ID 1002 starting after 500ms
      delay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of movement synchronization
    within TrinityCore's AI and movement systems. The animation tier values are typically
    defined by the game's animation system and may vary based on character class,
    race, or environmental conditions. The transition start time parameter allows
    for precise control over when animations begin, which is crucial for smooth transitions
    between different movement states.
  warnings: Incorrect animation tier values can result in invalid or missing animations
    during movement. The transition ID should be unique per animation state to avoid
    conflicts in the animation system. Setting a negative transition start time may
    cause unexpected behavior in animation timing.
