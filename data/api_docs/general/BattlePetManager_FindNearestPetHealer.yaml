  method: FindNearestPetHealer
  signature: uint32 BattlePetManager::FindNearestPetHealer(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the entry ID of the nearest pet healer NPC for the specified
    player.
  description: The FindNearestPetHealer method searches for the closest available
    pet healer NPC within the player's current map and returns its entry ID. This
    functionality is typically used in battle pet systems to locate NPCs that can
    restore health or provide other services to a player's summoned pets. The method
    operates on the assumption that there is at least one pet healer present in the
    same map as the player, and it will return 0 if no valid healer is found. It does
    not perform any direct interaction with the NPC but rather identifies which one
    would be the most suitable candidate based on proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's GUID or index in
      the world. This parameter determines the context of the search for the nearest
      pet healer.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the entry ID of the nearest pet healer
    NPC. If no valid healer is found, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 healerEntry = battlePetManager->FindNearestPetHealer(&playerGuid);\n\
      if (healerEntry != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n    printf(\"\
      Found pet healer with entry ID: %u\\n\", healerEntry);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No\
      \ healer found\n    printf(\"No nearby pet healer found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal NPC database and map data structures to
    determine proximity. It may not account for line-of-sight or other environmental
    factors that could affect actual interaction with an NPC.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and points to a live player
    object; otherwise, the behavior of this function is undefined. Also note that
    this method returns only the entry ID and does not perform any actual healing
    or teleportation logic.
