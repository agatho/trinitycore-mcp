  class: MeleePositionStrategy
  method: MeleePositionStrategy
  signature: void MeleePositionStrategy::MeleePositionStrategy(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new melee position strategy for the specified map.
  description: The MeleePositionStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of
    the melee positioning strategy class, associating it with a specific game map.
    This strategy is typically used by AI-controlled units to determine optimal positioning
    during melee combat engagements. The method sets up internal state and configuration
    parameters necessary for calculating and maintaining proper melee positioning
    relative to target enemies within the provided map context.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object that this melee position strategy will
      operate on. Must be a valid map instance, cannot be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Map* myMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      MeleePositionStrategy strategy(myMap);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeStrategy()\
      \ {\n        Map* map = me->GetMap();\n        meleeStrategy = new MeleePositionStrategy(map);\n\
      \    }\nprivate:\n    MeleePositionStrategy* meleeStrategy;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex calculations or pathfinding
    operations. It simply initializes the strategy object with the map reference and
    prepares internal data structures. The actual positioning logic is typically invoked
    through other methods like CalculatePosition() or Update(). This class is part
    of TrinityCore's AI system and integrates with the broader combat positioning
    framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Map pointer is valid and not destroyed before
    this strategy object is used. Using an invalid map reference can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes during AI operations. The strategy object should be properly
    managed by the owning AI component to prevent memory leaks.
