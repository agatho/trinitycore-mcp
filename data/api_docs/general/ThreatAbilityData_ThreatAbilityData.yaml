  signature: void ThreatAbilityData::ThreatAbilityData(uint32 id, ThreatAbilityType
    t, float mod, uint32 cd, uint32 dur, uint32 cost, float r, bool target, bool passive,
    uint32 level, const std::string & n)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new threat ability data entry with specified properties.
  description: The ThreatAbilityData constructor initializes a new threat ability
    data entry with the provided parameters. This method sets up all necessary attributes
    for a threat ability, including its unique identifier, type, modifier value, cooldown
    time, duration, cost, range, targeting behavior, passivity, required level, and
    name. The class is used to define various threat-generating abilities within the
    game's AI system, particularly for NPC mobs that utilize threat mechanics to manage
    combat engagement. This initialization ensures that each threat ability has consistent
    and predictable behavior when applied during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the threat ability. Must be a positive integer
      representing a distinct ability in the game's database.
  - name: t
    description: Threat ability type enum value defining the category or behavior
      of this ability (e.g., melee, spell, aura).
  - name: mod
    description: Modifier value that affects the amount of threat generated by this
      ability. Can be positive or negative depending on intended effect.
  - name: cd
    description: Cooldown time in milliseconds before this ability can be used again
      after activation.
  - name: dur
    description: Duration in milliseconds that the threat ability remains active or
      effective.
  - name: cost
    description: Resource cost associated with using this ability (e.g., mana, rage,
      energy).
  - name: r
    description: Range value defining how far the ability can affect targets. Measured
      in yards or game units.
  - name: target
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this ability requires a target (true)
      or can be self-targeted (false).
  - name: passive
    description: Boolean flag indicating if this ability is passive (true) or active
      (false), affecting when it's triggered.
  - name: level
    description: Minimum character level required to use this threat ability. Zero
      indicates no level restriction.
  - name: n
    description: String name identifying the ability for debugging and logging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Ability Initialization
    code: ThreatAbilityData ability(1001, THREAT_ABILITY_MELEE, 50.0f, 2000, 3000,
      50, 5.0f, true, false, 10, "Mortal Strike");
    language: cpp
  - title: Passive Threat Ability Setup
    code: ThreatAbilityData passiveAbility(2005, THREAT_ABILITY_AURA, 10.0f, 0, 60000,
      0, 0.0f, false, true, 0, "Threat Aura");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when loading
    ability definitions from database files. The parameters should be validated before
    calling to ensure they fall within expected ranges for game balance and performance.
    The class assumes that the ThreatAbilityType enum values are properly defined
    elsewhere in the codebase.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to unexpected behavior in combat AI,
    including invalid threat generation or ability activation issues. Ensure all IDs
    are unique across the system to prevent conflicts. Passive abilities should be
    carefully balanced as they can affect overall threat dynamics without explicit
    player input.
