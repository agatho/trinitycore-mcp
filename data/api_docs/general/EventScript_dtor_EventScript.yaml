documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EventScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The EventScript destructor is automatically invoked when an EventScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, registered callbacks, or internal
    state associated with the event script. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting
    system, this typically occurs when a game event that was using this script is
    removed or when the script itself is no longer needed. The destructor performs
    necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of EventScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    EventScript* script = new EventScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~EventScript()\n\
      }\n\n// Or with automatic cleanup:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    EventScript\
      \ script;\n    // ... use the script ...\n    // ~EventScript() called automatically\
      \ when script goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all resources allocated during
    the script's lifetime are properly released in this method to avoid memory leaks.
