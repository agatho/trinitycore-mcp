  method: InitializeMagePriorities
  signature: void EquipmentManager::InitializeMagePriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the equipment priorities for mage characters based on their spell
    school and gear requirements.
  description: The InitializeMagePriorities method sets up default equipment priority
    rules specific to mage classes within the EquipmentManager. This function configures
    how the system evaluates and ranks items such as robes, staves, wands, and other
    mage-specific gear based on spell school preferences (Arcane, Fire, Frost), stat
    weights (Intellect, Spell Power, Critical Strike, Haste), and item level requirements.
    It ensures that mages will prioritize equipment that maximizes their magical damage
    output or survivability depending on their specialization. The method is typically
    called during character initialization or when switching roles within the mage
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Character Initialization
    code: "void Player::InitializeMageEquipment()\n{\n    EquipmentManager* mgr =\
      \ GetEquipmentManager();\n    mgr->InitializeMagePriorities();\n    // Equipment\
      \ priorities are now set for this mage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal priority structures within the EquipmentManager
    and should only be called once per character or when class specialization changes.
    It does not directly modify player inventory but prepares the logic used by the
    equipment evaluation system.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without resetting prior configurations
    may lead to unexpected behavior in gear selection algorithms. Ensure that it's
    invoked before any automatic gear evaluation processes begin.
