documentation:
  brief: Tracks cooldowns for group members in the InterruptManager.
  description: The TrackGroupCooldowns method is responsible for monitoring and managing
    cooldown periods associated with group members within the InterruptManager system.
    This functionality ensures that abilities or interrupts applied by group members
    are properly tracked to prevent abuse or incorrect usage during group activities
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds. The method likely updates internal
    tracking structures to maintain synchronization of cooldown states across all
    group participants.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Context
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->TrackGroupCooldowns(groupMembers);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group-based gameplay events where
    cooldown management is critical for maintaining game balance and preventing exploits.
    It may be called automatically by the core engine upon group member actions or
    manually by scripts/ai components.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect cooldown states, potentially
    causing players to gain unfair advantages or experience unexpected behavior during
    group content. Ensure that group membership is properly validated before calling
    this method.
