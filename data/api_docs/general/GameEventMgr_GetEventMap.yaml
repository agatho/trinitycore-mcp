documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the internal map of game events.
  description: The GetEventMap method provides access to the internal data structure
    that stores all active game events within the TrinityCore server. This map contains
    metadata and configuration details for each registered event, allowing systems
    to query or iterate through available events. The returned reference is constant,
    meaning the underlying data should not be modified through this interface. This
    method is typically used by event management systems, scripting engines, or other
    subsystems that need to inspect or process game events without altering their
    definitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the GameEventDataMap which holds all registered
    game events. This map allows read-only access to event data including event IDs,
    start/end times, descriptions, and related properties.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through All Game Events
    code: "const GameEventDataMap& eventMap = sGameEventMgr->GetEventMap();\nfor (const\
      \ auto& pair : eventMap)\n{\n    uint16 eventId = pair.first;\n    const GameEventData&\
      \ eventData = pair.second;\n    // Process each game event\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Event ID: %u, Name: %s\", eventId, eventData.description.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned map is thread-safe for read operations but should not be modified.
    Accessing this map during event updates or modifications may lead to inconsistent
    results if the map is being updated concurrently. The GameEventDataMap is typically
    populated at server startup and during dynamic event activation.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned GameEventDataMap as it's a
    constant reference. Modifications should be made through appropriate event management
    APIs rather than direct map manipulation.
