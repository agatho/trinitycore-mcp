  method: ~ThreatReference
  signature: void ThreatReference::~ThreatReference()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ThreatReference object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The ThreatReference destructor is responsible for cleaning up the memory
    and resources allocated to a threat reference instance. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, threat references are used to track and manage aggro
    levels between creatures and players. When a ThreatReference object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of internal
    data structures and prevents memory leaks. The method typically handles deallocation
    of dynamically allocated memory and may perform additional cleanup tasks such
    as removing references from threat lists or notifying related systems about the
    reference's destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of ThreatReference
    code: 'ThreatReference* ref = new ThreatReference();

      // ... use the reference ...

      delete ref; // This calls ~ThreatReference()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction in Scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ThreatReference ref;\n    // ... use ref ...\n\
      \    // ref is automatically destroyed when leaving scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually invoke
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process may involve cleanup of linked list entries, removal from threat containers,
    and notification of AI systems about the reference's removal.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Calling it manually on stack-allocated objects will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that no other code holds references to the object
    being destroyed, as this could lead to dangling pointer issues.
