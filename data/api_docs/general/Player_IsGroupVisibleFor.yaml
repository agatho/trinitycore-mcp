  signature: bool Player::IsGroupVisibleFor(const Player * p) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is visible within the group.
  description: This method checks if a given player is visible in the current player's
    group, returning true if the player is visible and false otherwise. It is used
    primarily for determining visibility of players in group contexts, such as when
    checking if a player can see another player in a group or when determining whether
    a player should be included in group-related calculations. The method considers
    various factors including player visibility settings, group member status, and
    game mechanics related to player visibility within groups.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: A pointer to the player object being checked for visibility within
      the current player's group.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is visible in the current player's
    group, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can be seen by the current
    player within the context of their group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsGroupVisibleFor(targetPlayer)) {\n    // Player is visible\
      \ in group\n    // Do something\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not visible in\
      \ group\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may involve checking player visibility settings and group member
    status. Performance considerations include checking whether the player is in the
    same group as the current player, which requires minimal overhead but can add
    up in large groups. Thread safety is not an issue since this method does not modify
    any state.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a player is in
    the same group as the current player, as it may return false even if the player
    is part of the same group due to visibility settings. Be cautious when using this
    method in contexts where visibility settings are important.
