  class: EquipmentManager
  method: CompareItems
  signature: ItemComparisonResult EquipmentManager::CompareItems(int * player, int
    * currentItem, int * newItem)
documentation:
  brief: Compares two items for a player and returns their comparison result.
  description: The CompareItems method evaluates two items within a player's equipment
    context, determining how they compare in terms of item level, stats, and other
    relevant properties. This method is typically used during item swapping or equipping
    operations to ensure proper handling of item upgrades or replacements. It takes
    into account the player's current inventory state and performs a detailed comparison
    between the currently equipped item and a new item being considered for equipping.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose equipment is being compared.
  - name: currentItem
    description: Pointer to the currently equipped item that is being compared against.
  - name: newItem
    description: Pointer to the new item that is being evaluated for comparison with
      the current item.
  returns: Returns an ItemComparisonResult enum value indicating the outcome of the
    comparison. Possible values include ITEM_COMPARISON_BETTER, ITEM_COMPARISON_WORSE,
    ITEM_COMPARISON_EQUAL, and ITEM_COMPARISON_INCOMPATIBLE, representing how the
    new item compares to the current one in terms of stats and usability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Comparison
    code: "ItemComparisonResult result = equipmentManager->CompareItems(&player, &currentItem,\
      \ &newItem);\nif (result == ITEM_COMPARISON_BETTER) {\n    // Equip the new\
      \ item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Comparison Results
    code: "ItemComparisonResult result = equipmentManager->CompareItems(&player, &currentItem,\
      \ &newItem);\nswitch (result) {\n    case ITEM_COMPARISON_BETTER:\n        //\
      \ Replace current item with new item\n        break;\n    case ITEM_COMPARISON_WORSE:\n\
      \        // Do not replace\n        break;\n    case ITEM_COMPARISON_EQUAL:\n\
      \        // No change needed\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep comparison of item properties including item
    level, stats, and slot compatibility. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    equipment swapping logic to maintain proper inventory management and player progression.
    The method assumes valid pointers are passed and does not perform null checks.
  warnings: Ensure that both currentItem and newItem are valid items belonging to
    the player's inventory before calling this method. Passing invalid or unlinked
    item pointers may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method should only
    be called during safe game states where item modifications are allowed.
