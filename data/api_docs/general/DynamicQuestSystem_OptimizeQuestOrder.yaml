  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: OptimizeQuestOrder
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestOrder(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Reorders a player's active quests to optimize quest progression and efficiency.
  description: The OptimizeQuestOrder method reorganizes the sequence of active quests
    assigned to a player bot, aiming to improve quest completion flow by prioritizing
    quests that unlock new areas or provide beneficial rewards. This optimization
    ensures that the bot follows an efficient path through the questing system, minimizing
    backtracking and maximizing resource utilization. The method analyzes current
    quest states, dependencies, and reward structures to determine an optimal order
    for quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest order
      will be optimized. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Optimization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to a bot player

      DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestOrder(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimization with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = GetPlayer();\nif (bot != nullptr)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestOrder(bot);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid player reference\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal quest order state of the bot. It should
    be called after quest status changes or when new quests are added to ensure optimal
    progression. The optimization algorithm considers quest prerequisites, area unlocks,
    and reward distributions.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player without active quests may result in unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the player has valid quest data before invoking this function.
