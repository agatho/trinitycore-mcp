  class: PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
  method: PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
  signature: void PlayerbotDatabaseConnection::PlayerbotDatabaseConnection()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection class for managing
    database connections used by playerbot AI systems.
  description: The PlayerbotDatabaseConnection constructor initializes a new database
    connection object specifically designed for playerbot AI functionality within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the necessary connection parameters
    and configuration required to interact with the playerbot database, which stores
    bot-related data such as behavior patterns, quest progress, and AI decision-making
    information. The initialization process typically involves establishing connection
    settings, configuring timeouts, and preparing the connection pool for concurrent
    access by multiple bot instances. This constructor is part of the broader playerbot
    system architecture that enables automated character control within World of Warcraft
    servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PlayerbotDatabaseConnection instance
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseConnection* dbConn = new PlayerbotDatabaseConnection();\n\
      // The connection is now ready for use with playerbot database operations\n\
      std::string query = \"SELECT * FROM playerbot_ai_events WHERE bot_id = 123\"\
      ;\nif (dbConn->ExecuteQuery(query)) {\n    // Process query results\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the playerbot system when
    initializing bot AI components. Developers should not directly instantiate this
    class unless implementing custom database connection handling for playerbots.
    The connection object manages its own resource cleanup and should be properly
    disposed of when no longer needed.
