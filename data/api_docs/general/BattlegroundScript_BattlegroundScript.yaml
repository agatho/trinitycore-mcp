  class: BattlegroundScript
  method: BattlegroundScript
  signature: void BattlegroundScript::BattlegroundScript(BattlegroundMap * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground script with the specified battleground map.
  description: The BattlegroundScript constructor initializes a new battleground script
    instance, associating it with a specific battleground map. This constructor is
    typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when a battleground instance
    is created. It sets up the necessary internal state and references required for
    the battleground script to function correctly within the game's battleground system.
    The map parameter provides access to all battleground-related data and functionality
    needed for the script to operate.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the BattlegroundMap instance that this script will be
      associated with. This parameter cannot be null and must point to a valid battleground
      map object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "class MyBattlegroundScript : public BattlegroundScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  MyBattlegroundScript(BattlegroundMap* map) : BattlegroundScript(map)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Custom initialization code here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is not meant to be called directly by custom battleground
    scripts. It's typically invoked by the framework during battleground creation.
    The map parameter must remain valid for the lifetime of the script instance.
  warnings: Do not attempt to call this constructor with a null map parameter as it
    will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the BattlegroundMap
    pointer passed is valid and properly initialized.
