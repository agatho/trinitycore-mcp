  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetSystemOptimizationSuggestions
  signature: std::vector<std::string> BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetSystemOptimizationSuggestions()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a list of system optimization suggestions based on bot performance
    analytics.
  description: The GetSystemOptimizationSuggestions method analyzes various performance
    metrics and system conditions related to bot operations within the TrinityCore
    environment. It evaluates factors such as CPU usage, memory consumption, AI decision-making
    efficiency, and network latency to provide actionable recommendations for improving
    overall system performance. This method is typically used by administrators or
    developers monitoring bot behavior in World of Warcraft servers to identify potential
    bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A vector of strings containing optimization suggestions. Each string represents
    a specific recommendation that can be implemented to improve system performance,
    such as adjusting AI parameters, reducing bot count, or optimizing server resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<std::string> suggestions\
      \ = analytics.GetSystemOptimizationSuggestions();\nfor (const auto& suggestion\
      \ : suggestions) {\n    std::cout << \"Suggestion: \" << suggestion << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs resource-intensive analysis and should be called
    sparingly in performance-critical sections. The suggestions returned are based
    on heuristics and may not account for all possible system configurations or edge
    cases.
