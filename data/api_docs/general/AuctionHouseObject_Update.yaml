  brief: Updates the auction house object's internal state and processes pending auction
    operations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the auction house
    object's current state by processing any pending auctions, checking for expired
    items, and ensuring that all auction-related data is synchronized with the game
    world. This method typically runs on a periodic basis within the game loop to
    handle time-based auction mechanics such as item expiration, bid processing, and
    notification of successful sales. It ensures that the auction house reflects the
    most up-to-date information regarding available auctions and their statuses.
