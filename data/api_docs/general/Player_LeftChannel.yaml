  brief: Player leaves a channel
  description: This method is called when a player disconnects from a chat channel,
    typically triggered by a disconnection or explicit leave operation. It removes
    the player from the channel's list of participants and updates the channel's state
    accordingly. The method ensures proper cleanup of channel references and maintains
    game mechanics integrity for chat system operations.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Channel* channel = new Channel();

      player->LeftChannel(channel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include ensuring proper synchronization of channel
    state, removing player from channel's participant list, and potentially updating
    channel's internal state. Performance considerations involve avoiding race conditions
    during concurrent channel operations.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly without proper channel management;
    improper usage may lead to memory leaks or invalid channel references.
