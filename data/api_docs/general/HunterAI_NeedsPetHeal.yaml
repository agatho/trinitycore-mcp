documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's pet requires healing.
  description: The NeedsPetHeal method evaluates the current health status of the
    hunter's pet and returns true if the pet's health is below a certain threshold
    that warrants immediate healing. This method is typically used by the HunterAI
    class to decide when to cast healing spells or summon a new pet. The decision
    logic considers the pet's current health percentage, the presence of harmful effects,
    and the hunter's available resources such as mana or spirit. It plays a crucial
    role in pet management during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter's pet needs healing based on current health
    status and combat conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->NeedsPetHeal()) {\n    // Cast a healing spell on\
      \ the pet\n    player->CastSpell(player->GetPet(), SPELL_HEALING_SPELL, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pet Management System
    code: "class MyHunterAI : public HunterAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (NeedsPetHeal()) {\n            // Prioritize\
      \ pet healing over other actions\n            DoPetHealing();\n        } else\
      \ {\n            // Continue with normal hunting behavior\n            DoNormalHunting();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making process for hunters. It
    may be called frequently during combat, so performance is important. The exact
    health threshold and conditions for triggering healing can vary based on the specific
    hunter class specialization and gear.
  warnings: Do not assume that a pet needing healing means it will die immediately;
    this method is primarily used to determine when to apply preventive healing measures.
    Also, ensure proper checks are in place before attempting to heal, as some healing
    spells may have resource requirements or cooldowns.
