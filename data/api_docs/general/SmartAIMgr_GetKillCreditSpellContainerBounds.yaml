documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell container bounds associated with a specific kill credit
    ID.
  description: The GetKillCreditSpellContainerBounds method retrieves the cached spell
    container bounds for a given kill credit identifier. This is typically used in
    SmartAI scripts to determine which spells should be credited when a creature or
    player achieves a specific kill. The method accesses an internal cache that maps
    kill credit IDs to their corresponding spell containers, allowing for efficient
    lookup without recalculating or reinitializing data. It's commonly employed in
    quest-related AI behaviors where killing a specific NPC or mob grants credit for
    a spell or ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CacheSpellContainerBounds object representing the bounds of the spell
    container associated with the specified kill credit. This structure likely contains
    information about the start and end indices of spells within a larger container,
    enabling iteration or access to specific spells related to the kill credit.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell Container Bounds for Kill Credit
    code: "CacheSpellContainerBounds bounds = sSmartAIMgr->GetKillCreditSpellContainerBounds(12345);\n\
      if (bounds.first != bounds.second)\n{\n    // Process the spell container range\n\
      \    for (auto it = bounds.first; it != bounds.second; ++it)\n    {\n      \
      \  // Handle individual spell in the container\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the kill credit ID has been properly registered
    in the SmartAI manager's internal cache. The returned bounds are typically used
    for range-based iteration over spells associated with a specific kill credit,
    and should not be modified directly. Performance is optimized through caching,
    so repeated calls with the same kill credit ID will return cached results.
  warnings: Ensure that the killCredit parameter corresponds to a valid registered
    kill credit in the SmartAI system; otherwise, the returned bounds may be invalid
    or empty. This method does not validate the existence of the kill credit ID, so
    calling it with an unregistered ID might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    spell handling.
