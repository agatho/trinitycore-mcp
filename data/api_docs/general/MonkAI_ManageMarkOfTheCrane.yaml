documentation:
  brief: Manages the Mark of the Crane ability for Monk AI, handling application,
    removal, and cooldown logic.
  description: The ManageMarkOfTheCrane method controls the behavior of the Mark of
    the Crane ability within the Monk AI system. This includes determining when to
    apply the mark to targets, managing its duration and effects, handling cooldown
    periods between uses, and ensuring proper interaction with other Monk abilities.
    The method integrates with the overall AI decision-making process to optimize
    the use of this key talent for damage mitigation and burst damage potential. It
    typically checks for valid targets, verifies ability availability, and applies
    necessary state changes to the affected units.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageMarkOfTheCrane();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the target selection system to determine
    optimal usage timing. Implementation may involve checking for existing Mark of
    the Crane debuffs on targets, managing cooldown timers, and ensuring proper spell
    casting mechanics are followed. The AI behavior should account for different combat
    scenarios where the mark might be more or less beneficial.
  warnings: Improper implementation could lead to incorrect application of the mark,
    potentially causing gameplay imbalance or unexpected behavior in Monk combat effectiveness.
    Ensure that target validation logic properly excludes invalid targets such as
    dead or immune units.
