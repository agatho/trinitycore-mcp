  class: FireMageRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void FireMageRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the fire mage's AoE spell rotation strategy based on enemy count
    and target selection.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a fire
    mage's area of effect (AoE) combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat scenario,
    including the number of enemies present and selected targets, to determine the
    optimal sequence of spells to cast. This method typically prioritizes high-damage
    AoE abilities such as Pyroblast, Blast Wave, or other applicable fire spells depending
    on the game state, cooldowns, and resource management. The method is designed
    to maximize damage output while maintaining proper spell usage efficiency in multi-target
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      primary target. This value may be used to determine which enemies are within
      range for AoE spells.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      in combat. This parameter influences spell selection and rotation priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int primaryTarget = 0;

      uint32 numEnemies = 5;

      fireMage->ExecuteAoERotation(&primaryTarget, numEnemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Selection with Enemy Count
    code: "int* targetPtr = &currentTargetIndex;\nuint32 enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n\
      if (enemyCount >= 3) {\n    fireMage->ExecuteAoERotation(targetPtr, enemyCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FireMageRefactored class has access to spell
    cooldowns, mana levels, and target information. It is typically called during
    combat when multiple enemies are present. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific fire mage build or rotation strategy being used.
  warnings: Ensure that enemyCount is accurately calculated before calling this method,
    as incorrect values can lead to inefficient spell usage or invalid targeting.
    This method should not be invoked outside of combat scenarios where AoE mechanics
    are relevant.
