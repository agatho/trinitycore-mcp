  brief: Stops the unit from attacking a specific faction
  description: This method prevents the Unit from engaging in combat with a specified
    faction. It effectively removes the unit's target from the given faction, halting
    any ongoing attacks or aggressive behavior towards that faction. The method is
    commonly used in scenarios where players or NPCs need to be prevented from attacking
    certain factions, such as during quest events or when managing NPC behavior. This
    functionality is crucial for controlling NPC aggression and maintaining game balance.
  parameters:
  - name: faction_id
    description: The faction identifier that the unit should stop attacking. This
      parameter determines which faction's aggressive behavior will be halted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stop Attack Faction Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();


      // Stop attacking a specific faction

      target->StopAttackFaction(112);


      // This prevents the unit from attacking faction 112'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other faction-related methods
    to manage NPC behavior. It does not affect the unit's overall target or state,
    but specifically removes the faction from the unit's attack list.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in NPC combat,
    especially if used without proper context. Ensure that the faction ID is valid
    and known before calling this method.
