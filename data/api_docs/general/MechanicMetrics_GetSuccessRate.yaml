  class: MechanicMetrics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float MechanicMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate percentage for a mechanic-based action
    or effect.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the probability of success for a
    specific mechanic, such as a spell or ability, based on various factors including
    player stats, equipment, buffs, debuffs, and game mechanics. This value is typically
    expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents
    no chance of success and 1.0 represents guaranteed success. The method is commonly
    used in combat calculations, skill checks, or ability resolution within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the success rate of a mechanic, ranging from
    0.0 (0% chance of success) to 1.0 (100% chance of success).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Calculation
    code: "float successRate = mechanicMetrics.GetSuccessRate();\nif (successRate\
      \ > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Proceed with successful action\n    DoAction();\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle failure case\n    HandleFailure();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Rate for Spell Casting
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && mechanicMetrics.GetSuccessRate()\
      \ >= 0.8f)\n{\n    // Cast spell with high probability of success\n    CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ID);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Consider alternative actions or reduce damage\n\
      \    ApplyReducedEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely aggregates multiple internal calculations such as base
    chance, modifiers from buffs/debuffs, stat multipliers, and environmental factors.
    It's designed to be called during combat or ability resolution phases of the game
    loop.
  warnings: Ensure that the MechanicMetrics object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as uninitialized values may lead to incorrect success rate
    calculations. This method should not be used in performance-critical sections
    without consideration of potential overhead from internal computations.
