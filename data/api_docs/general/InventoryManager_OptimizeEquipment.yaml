  class: InventoryManager
  method: OptimizeEquipment
  signature: uint32 InventoryManager::OptimizeEquipment()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the player's equipment by evaluating and rearranging items in the
    inventory for maximum effectiveness.
  description: The OptimizeEquipment method analyzes all equipped items and available
    inventory slots to determine the best possible arrangement for maximizing character
    performance. It evaluates item stats, enchantments, and gemming to suggest or
    implement optimal gear configurations. This process typically occurs when a player's
    gear changes significantly, such as after looting new items or leveling up. The
    method may trigger recalculations of player attributes like damage, defense, or
    spell power based on the optimized equipment setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of equipment slots that
    were modified or optimized during the process. A return value of 0 indicates no
    changes were made to the equipment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equipment Optimization
    code: "uint32 optimizedSlots = player->GetInventory()->OptimizeEquipment();\n\
      if (optimizedSlots > 0)\n{\n    // Notify player that equipment was optimized\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Your equipment has been optimized.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game engine during certain
    events like level-ups or when new items are added to inventory. It may also be
    invoked manually by players through specific UI interactions or commands. The
    optimization process can have performance implications on systems with many items,
    especially in high-level content.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance degradation due
    to the intensive calculations involved. It should not be called in tight loops
    or during critical game events where responsiveness is essential. Additionally,
    manual invocation might conflict with automatic optimization features if not properly
    synchronized.
