  class: RogueAI
  method: GetComboPoints
  signature: uint32 RogueAI::GetComboPoints()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of combo points possessed by the rogue AI.
  description: The GetComboPoints method retrieves the number of combo points currently
    available to the rogue AI. In World of Warcraft's combat system, combo points
    are a resource used by rogues and other classes to fuel special abilities. This
    method provides access to the internal combo point counter maintained by the RogueAI
    class. The returned value typically ranges from 0 to 5, representing the number
    of combo points that can be spent on abilities like Slice and Dice, Eviscerate,
    or Rupture. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making logic to determine
    which abilities are available for casting based on current combo point resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of combo points currently available
    to the rogue AI. The value is typically between 0 and 5, where 0 indicates no
    combo points and 5 represents the maximum combo points that can be accumulated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (GetComboPoints() >= 3)\n\
      \    {\n        // Use Eviscerate when we have at least 3 combo points\n   \
      \     DoCastVictim(SPELL_EVISCERATE);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Otherwise\
      \ use Sinister Strike to build combo points\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_SINISTER_STRIKE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking combo points before using a finisher
    code: "if (GetComboPoints() == 5)\n{\n    // Execute the highest damage finisher\n\
      \    DoCastVictim(SPELL_KINGSBANE);\n}\nelse if (GetComboPoints() >= 2)\n{\n\
      \    // Use a mid-tier finisher\n    DoCastVictim(SPELL_RUPTURE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RogueAI class and should only be called on valid
    rogue AI instances. The combo point count may change frequently during combat
    as abilities are used or procs occur, so caching this value for extended periods
    may lead to stale data. The method does not perform any validation or error checking
    beyond returning the internal counter value.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned combo point value will remain constant
    between calls. Combo points can change rapidly during combat through various game
    mechanics such as ability usage, procs, or damage dealt. Always check the current
    value before making decisions based on combo point requirements.
