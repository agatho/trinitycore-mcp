  class: ProtectionShieldTracker
  method: ApplyShield
  signature: void ProtectionShieldTracker::ApplyShield()
documentation:
  brief: Applies a protective shield to the target unit, modifying their damage absorption
    capabilities.
  description: 'The ApplyShield method activates a protective shield on the target
    unit, which reduces incoming damage by a specified amount or percentage. This
    mechanism is typically used in conjunction with abilities that grant temporary
    defensive buffs, such as paladin''s Divine Shield or warrior''s Shield Wall. The
    shield consumes resources (such as mana or rage) and may have a limited duration
    or usage count. The method ensures the shield is properly initialized and registered
    within the unit''s active effects list, making it effective immediately upon invocation.
    Precondition: The target unit must be valid and not already under the effect of
    an incompatible shield type.'

  examples:
  - title: Basic Shield Application
    code: 'ProtectionShieldTracker* tracker = player->GetShieldTracker();

      tracker->ApplyShield();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the shield effect is intended to be
    active. It does not validate whether the unit has sufficient resources or if the
    shield is already applied; such checks are typically handled by calling code.
  warnings: Calling ApplyShield without verifying that the target can actually receive
    a shield may lead to undefined behavior or client-side visual inconsistencies.
    Ensure compatibility with existing shield effects before applying new ones.
