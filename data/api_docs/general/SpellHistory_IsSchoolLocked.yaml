documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell school is currently locked in the spell history.
  description: The IsSchoolLocked method determines whether a specific magic school
    is currently restricted or 'locked' within the spell history system. This typically
    occurs when a spell from that school is on cooldown or otherwise unavailable for
    casting. The method evaluates the internal state of the SpellHistory class to
    return true if the specified school is locked, and false otherwise. In World of
    Warcraft's context, this is used to prevent players from spamming or rapidly recasting
    spells from the same school during cooldown periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell school is currently locked (unavailable
    for casting), false if it is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (spellHistory.IsSchoolLocked(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE)) {\n    // Fire spells\
      \ are currently locked\n    SendSpellFailed(player, spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell casting logic to enforce cooldown restrictions
    and prevent players from casting spells too rapidly. It's part of the core spell
    handling system that ensures game balance and prevents exploit abuse.
