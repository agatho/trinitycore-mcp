  method: primCount
  signature: uint32 BIH::primCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of primitives contained in the BIH structure
  description: The primCount method retrieves the total count of primitives (such
    as triangles or other geometric elements) stored within the Bounding Interval
    Hierarchy (BIH) data structure. This method is typically used for debugging, performance
    monitoring, or determining the complexity of spatial partitioning structures.
    The BIH is commonly employed in collision detection and spatial queries within
    TrinityCore's world system to efficiently manage and query large sets of geometric
    data. This method provides a read-only count of primitives without modifying the
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of primitives currently stored
    in the BIH structure. Returns zero if the structure is empty or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Primitive Count
    code: "BIH bih;\n// ... populate BIH with primitives ...\nuint32 count = bih.primCount();\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"BIH contains %u primitives\\n\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Primitive Count for Debugging
    code: "void DebugBIH(const BIH& bih)\n{\n    uint32 primCount = bih.primCount();\n\
      \    printf(\"Debug: BIH primitive count = %u\\n\", primCount);\n    // Additional\
      \ debugging logic based on count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant-time operation and does not perform any computation
    or traversal of the BIH structure. It likely returns a cached value for performance
    reasons, making it safe to call frequently during runtime. The BIH structure may
    be used internally by TrinityCore's collision system to optimize spatial queries.
