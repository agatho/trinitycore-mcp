  class: Battleground

  signature: void Battleground::SendChatMessage(Creature * source, int textId, WorldObject
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a battleground chat message from a creature to a target object using
    a specified text ID.
  description: The SendChatMessage method is used within the TrinityCore framework
    to broadcast a localized chat message in a battleground context. It takes a Creature
    as the source of the message, an integer textId that corresponds to a predefined
    message in the game's localization system, and a target WorldObject which can
    be a player or another object. This method ensures that the appropriate message
    is sent to the correct audience within the battleground environment, respecting
    the game's communication rules and localization settings. The method does not
    return any value and is typically used for announcing events, objectives, or other
    important information during battleground gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: A pointer to the Creature object that will be sending the chat message.
      This creature must exist within the battleground context and should have valid
      AI behavior set up to send messages.
  - name: textId
    description: An integer identifier that maps to a specific localized string in
      the game's database. This ID corresponds to entries in the 'battleground_chat_messages'
      table or similar localization system, defining what message is sent to players.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject that will receive the chat message.
      This can be a Player object or another valid WorldObject within the battleground.
      If null, the message may broadcast to all players in the battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send a simple battleground announcement
    code: 'Creature* source = ...; // Assume valid creature

      int textId = 12345; // Valid chat message ID

      WorldObject* target = nullptr; // Broadcast to all players

      battleground->SendChatMessage(source, textId, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send a targeted message to a specific player
    code: 'Creature* source = ...;

      int textId = 12346;

      Player* playerTarget = ...; // Valid player object

      battleground->SendChatMessage(source, textId, playerTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying localization system and requires that
    the provided textId exists in the database. It should only be called from within
    a battleground context where players are actively participating. The source creature
    must be properly initialized and associated with the battleground to ensure correct
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid textId or null source/creature may
    result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that all parameters are
    valid before calling, especially when targeting specific players in a dynamic
    battleground environment.
