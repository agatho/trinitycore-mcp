  class: CharmInfo
  method: HasCommandState
  signature: bool CharmInfo::HasCommandState(CommandStates state) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the charm has a specific command state enabled.
  description: The HasCommandState method determines whether a specific command state
    is currently active for the charm. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework to manage the behavior and control states of summoned creatures or pets.
    It evaluates the current command state flags stored within the CharmInfo object
    and returns true if the specified state is set, otherwise false. The command states
    typically represent different modes of operation such as 'follow', 'attack', or
    'passive' for summoned creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified CommandStates flag is currently active in
    the charm's state management; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if charm is in attack command state
    code: "if (charmInfo->HasCommandState(COMMAND_ATTACK)) {\n    // Handle attack\
      \ command state logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional behavior based on charm state
    code: "if (!charmInfo->HasCommandState(COMMAND_FOLLOW)) {\n    // Charm is not\
      \ following, so execute alternative behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal command state flags that are managed by
    the TrinityCore AI system. The CommandStates enum typically includes values like
    COMMAND_STAY, COMMAND_FOLLOW, COMMAND_ATTACK, etc. This method should only be
    called on valid CharmInfo objects that have been properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not use this method on uninitialized or null CharmInfo objects as it
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure the charm has been properly initialized
    with command states before calling this method.
