documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is classified as a crafting reagent.
  description: This method checks if the item template represents a crafting reagent,
    which are items used in the creation of other items through professions such as
    Alchemy, Enchanting, Engineering, etc. The check is based on internal flags or
    properties assigned to the item template within the TrinityCore database. This
    functionality is crucial for determining valid ingredients in crafting systems
    and preventing invalid items from being used in recipes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as a crafting reagent; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a crafting reagent
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate\
      \ && itemTemplate->IsCraftingReagent()) {\n    // This item can be used as a\
      \ reagent in crafting\n    printf(\"Item %d is a crafting reagent\\n\", itemTemplate->ItemId);\n\
      } else {\n    // This item cannot be used as a reagent\n    printf(\"Item %d\
      \ is not a crafting reagent\\n\", itemTemplate->ItemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal flagging system within TrinityCore's item
    template data. It is typically used during crafting recipe validation to ensure
    only appropriate items are accepted as ingredients.
