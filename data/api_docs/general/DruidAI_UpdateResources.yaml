documentation:
  brief: Updates the Druid AI's resource management including mana, energy, and rage.
  description: The UpdateResources method is responsible for managing and updating
    the resource states of a Druid AI character in the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes tracking and adjusting mana levels for spell casting, energy for cat
    form abilities, and rage for bear form abilities. The method ensures that the
    AI character's resources are properly maintained according to game mechanics and
    class-specific behavior. It typically runs during each AI update cycle to keep
    resource values synchronized with the character's current state and available
    actions.

  - title: Basic Resource Update Call
    code: "void UpdateResources()\n{\n    // Called internally by AI system\n    if\
      \ (m_player)\n        m_player->UpdateMana();\n    if (m_unit)\n        m_unit->UpdateEnergy();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the AI update loop and
    should not be called directly in most cases. The implementation may vary based
    on the specific Druid form the character is currently in, as different forms have
    different resource management requirements.
