  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: IsPointInCircle
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::IsPointInCircle(const int & point, const int & center,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given point lies within a circular area defined by a
    center point and radius.
  description: 'The IsPointInCircle method evaluates whether a specified point is
    located inside or on the boundary of a circle. It takes three parameters: the
    coordinates of the point to check, the center of the circle, and the radius of
    the circle. This utility function is commonly used in game mechanics for collision
    detection, area-of-effect spell targeting, and AI pathfinding calculations. The
    method performs a mathematical comparison using Euclidean distance to determine
    if the point falls within the circular boundary. Precondition: All parameters
    must represent valid coordinate values; postcondition: Returns true if the point
    is inside or on the edge of the circle, false otherwise.'
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: The coordinates of the point to be checked, represented as an integer
      value. In TrinityCore context, this typically refers to a position coordinate
      in the game world.
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the circle, also represented as an integer value.
      This defines where the circle is positioned in the game world.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area, specified as a floating-point number.
      Defines how far the circle extends from its center point.
  returns: Returns true if the specified point lies within or on the boundary of the
    circle defined by the center and radius; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool isInCircle = ObstacleUtils::IsPointInCircle(100, 50, 20.0f); // Checks
      if point 100 is within a circle centered at 50 with radius 20
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Targeting Check
    code: "if (ObstacleUtils::IsPointInCircle(targetPosition, casterPosition, spellRadius))\n\
      {\n    // Apply spell effect\n    ApplySpellEffect(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the point and center parameters are represented
    in a consistent coordinate system. It's optimized for performance and suitable
    for frequent calls during game logic execution. The implementation uses squared
    distance comparisons to avoid expensive square root calculations, improving efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that the input values for point and center are valid coordinates
    within the expected range of the game world. Incorrectly scaled or invalid radius
    values may lead to unexpected behavior. Be cautious when using this method in
    high-frequency loops as performance can be impacted by large numbers of comparisons.
