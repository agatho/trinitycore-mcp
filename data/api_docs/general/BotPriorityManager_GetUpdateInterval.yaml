  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityManager::GetUpdateInterval(BotPriority priority) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds for a specified bot priority
    level.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval (in milliseconds)
    that determines how frequently bots with a specific priority level should be updated
    or processed by the system. This interval is used to control the frequency of
    bot behavior updates, resource allocation, and other periodic tasks associated
    with different priority levels. The method accepts a BotPriority enum value as
    input and returns the corresponding interval value. This mechanism allows for
    efficient resource management by ensuring that high-priority bots are updated
    more frequently than low-priority ones, while also preventing excessive CPU usage
    from overly frequent updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds
    for the specified bot priority level. A higher value indicates less frequent updates,
    while a lower value indicates more frequent updates.
  examples:
  - title: Get update interval for high priority bots
    code: 'uint32 highPriorityInterval = botPriorityManager.GetUpdateInterval(BotPriority::HIGH);

      // Returns the interval in milliseconds for high-priority bots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use interval to schedule bot updates
    code: 'BotPriority priority = BotPriority::MEDIUM;

      uint32 interval = botPriorityManager.GetUpdateInterval(priority);

      // Schedule next update after ''interval'' milliseconds

      botScheduler.ScheduleUpdate(interval);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with a scheduling system to
    manage when bots of different priorities should be processed. The intervals are
    usually configured based on game mechanics and performance requirements, with
    higher priority bots having shorter intervals to ensure responsive behavior.
