documentation:
  brief: Plays a sound effect at a specific distance from the target player
  description: The PlayDistanceSound method plays a specified sound ID at a distance
    from the target player, allowing for spatial audio effects in World of Warcraft.
    This method is commonly used for creating immersive audio experiences when objects
    interact with players, such as triggering sounds when a player approaches certain
    game objects or NPCs. The sound plays at the actual location of the WorldObject
    relative to the target player's position, enabling precise control over where
    audio occurs in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: soundId
    description: The unique identifier for the sound effect to play, typically referencing
      a sound entry in the game database
  - name: target
    description: The player object at which the sound should be played, determining
      the spatial position of the audio effect
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Player* target = new Player();

      obj->PlayDistanceSound(12345, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires the target player to be valid and active in the game
    world. The sound ID must correspond to an existing sound entry in the database,
    otherwise the audio effect may not play correctly or may produce errors.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with multiple players as it
    may cause performance issues if used excessively. Also, ensure that the target
    player is valid and exists before calling this method.
