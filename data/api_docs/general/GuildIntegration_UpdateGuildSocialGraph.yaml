api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: UpdateGuildSocialGraph
  signature: void GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildSocialGraph(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the social graph data for a specified guild, including member relationships
    and interactions.
  description: The UpdateGuildSocialGraph method refreshes and synchronizes the social
    network data within a guild. This includes tracking member connections, communication
    patterns, and relationship dynamics between guild members. The method ensures
    that the internal representation of guild social structures remains consistent
    with current in-game interactions and membership changes. It typically triggers
    updates to cached social data structures and may propagate changes to related
    systems such as guild chat channels or social interaction logs.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose social graph needs to be
      updated. Must correspond to an existing guild in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildSocialGraph(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Guilds
    code: "std::vector<uint32> guildIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : guildIds)\n\
      {\n    GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildSocialGraph(id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive if the guild has many members
    or complex social interactions. It's recommended to call this method during low-traffic
    periods or as part of scheduled maintenance tasks.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid guildId (non-existent) may result
    in undefined behavior or database errors. Always validate the guild ID before
    invoking this function.
