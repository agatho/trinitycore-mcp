  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: IsOptimalInterruptTime
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::IsOptimalInterruptTime(const InterruptContext
    & context) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current interrupt action occurs at an optimal timing
    based on the provided interrupt context.
  description: The IsOptimalInterruptTime method evaluates if a spell interruption
    action is occurring at the most effective time within the game's mechanics. This
    typically involves checking factors such as the caster's current state, the target's
    vulnerability, and the timing of the interrupt relative to the spell's cast phase.
    The method uses the provided InterruptContext to make this determination, which
    likely contains data about the spell being interrupted, the caster, and the environment.
    It returns true if the interrupt is considered optimal for gameplay balance and
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial in maintaining game fairness and
    ensuring that players cannot exploit timing mechanics to gain unfair advantages.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the interrupt action occurs
    at an optimal time. True indicates optimal timing, while false suggests the interrupt
    might be too early or too late in the spell's execution cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nInterruptContext context;\n// ...\
      \ populate context with relevant data ...\nbool isOptimal = interruptAction.IsOptimalInterruptTime(context);\n\
      if (isOptimal) {\n    // Proceed with optimal interrupt logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game timing systems and may be
    used in conjunction with spell casting state checks. Developers should ensure
    that the InterruptContext passed to this method is properly initialized with relevant
    data about the spell, caster, and target states.
  warnings: Improperly configured InterruptContext data could lead to incorrect return
    values, potentially causing gameplay imbalance or unexpected behavior during spell
    interruptions. Ensure all required fields in the context are populated before
    calling this method.
