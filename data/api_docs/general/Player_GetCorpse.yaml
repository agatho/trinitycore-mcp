  description: The GetCorpse method retrieves the unique identifier of the player's
    corpse. This identifier is used to reference the player's corpse in the game world,
    typically when the player dies and their body becomes available for looting or
    resurrection. The method returns an integer value representing the GUID of the
    corpse object, which can be used for various operations including corpse retrieval,
    resurrection, and looting. This method is essential for handling player death
    mechanics and corpse-related gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the player's
    corpse object. This value corresponds to the GUID of the corpse that was created
    upon player death.

    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other corpse-related methods
    like GetCorpse() and GetCorpseType() to determine the state of a player's corpse.
    The returned value may be zero if no corpse exists or if the player has not died
    yet.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is dead or has died
    recently; calling it while the player is alive will return an invalid value or
    zero.
