  class: GatheringManager
  method: SetPrioritizeSkillUps
  signature: void GatheringManager::SetPrioritizeSkillUps(bool prioritize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether gathering activities should prioritize skill ups over other
    considerations.
  description: The SetPrioritizeSkillUps method configures the GatheringManager to
    prioritize skill advancement during gathering operations. When enabled, the system
    will attempt to select nodes or resources that provide the highest potential for
    skill gain, potentially at the expense of resource quantity or efficiency. This
    setting affects all subsequent gathering actions performed by the manager instance.
    The behavior is typically used in crafting and gathering systems where players
    want to maximize their skill progression rather than simply collect materials.
  parameters:
  - name: prioritize
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to prioritize skill ups (true) or
      not (false). When true, gathering operations will favor nodes that offer the
      best skill gain potential.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Skill Up Prioritization
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->SetPrioritizeSkillUps(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Skill Up Prioritization
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->SetPrioritizeSkillUps(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This setting is typically used in conjunction with other gathering configurations
    such as node selection preferences or resource type filters. The effect of this
    method may vary depending on the specific gathering system implementation and
    the availability of skill-advancing resources.
