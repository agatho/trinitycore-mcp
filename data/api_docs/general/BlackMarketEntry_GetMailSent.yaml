  signature: bool BlackMarketEntry::GetMailSent() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a mail notification has been sent for the black market item.
  description: The GetMailSent method determines if a notification email has already
    been dispatched to the player regarding this black market entry. This is typically
    used to prevent duplicate mail notifications when processing auction house transactions
    or black market listings. The method returns true if the mail has been sent, and
    false otherwise. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this flag helps manage communication between the game server and players for black
    market item updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a mail notification has been sent for this black market
    entry; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Mail Was Sent Before Sending
    code: "if (!blackMarketEntry->GetMailSent()) {\n    // Send mail notification\n\
      \    blackMarketEntry->SetMailSent(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with SetMailSent() to track the
    state of mail delivery for black market items. It's important to ensure that mail
    is only sent once per item to avoid spamming players.
