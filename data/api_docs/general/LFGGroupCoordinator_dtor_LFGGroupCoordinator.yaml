documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LFGGroupCoordinator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LFGGroupCoordinator class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated to the coordinator object. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures, removing references to players or groups,
    and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    LFG (Looking For Group) system, this method ensures that when a group coordinator
    is no longer needed, it properly disengages from the LFG framework without leaving
    behind any lingering state or memory leaks. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LFGGroupCoordinator
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = new LFGGroupCoordinator();\n\
      \    // ... use the coordinator ...\n    delete coordinator; // Destructor is\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based destruction of LFGGroupCoordinator
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;\n    //\
      \ ... use the coordinator ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when coordinator\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is important to ensure that all references to this coordinator are
    removed before destruction to prevent use-after-free errors. The implementation
    likely handles cleanup of internal LFG state, such as group assignments, player
    tracking, and communication with the LFG queue system.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you are managing object lifetime
    manually. Calling it on an already destroyed object will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that no other components are referencing this coordinator before allowing
    it to be destroyed.
