  signature: uint32 CharacterCache::GetCharacterAccountIdByName(const std::string
    & name) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account identifier associated with a given character name from
    the cache.
  description: The GetCharacterAccountIdByName method looks up and returns the unique
    account identifier (AccountID) for a specified character name stored within the
    CharacterCache. This method is typically used to determine which account owns
    a particular character, enabling operations such as account-specific permissions
    checks or player-related data retrieval. The method operates on cached data, meaning
    it will only return results for characters that have been previously loaded into
    memory and cached by the system. If the character name does not exist in the cache,
    the behavior is undefined and may result in a zero or invalid ID being returned.
    This function is part of the TrinityCore's character management infrastructure
    and is essential for maintaining player session integrity and access control.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The exact name of the character to look up. Must be a valid, non-empty
      string matching an existing character in the database.
  returns: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the account identifier (AccountID)
    associated with the specified character name. If the character is not found in
    the cache, it returns zero, indicating either no match or an invalid lookup result.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterAccountIdByName(\"PlayerName\"\
      );\nif (accountId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with account-based operations\n \
      \   printf(\"Account ID for PlayerName is: %u\\n\", accountId);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Handle case where character was not found in cache\n    printf(\"Character\
      \ 'PlayerName' not found in cache.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 GetAccountIdForCharacter(const std::string& charName)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ accountId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterAccountIdByName(charName);\n    if\
      \ (accountId == 0)\n    {\n        // Optionally trigger a database lookup if\
      \ not in cache\n        // This is an example of how you might extend functionality\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Character '%s' not found in character cache.\", charName.c_str());\n\
      \        return 0;\n    }\n    return accountId;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal CharacterCache being populated with valid
    character data. It's important to ensure that the cache is properly initialized
    and updated before calling this function. The method performs a fast lookup in
    memory, so performance is generally good, but it will fail if the character name
    is not present in the cache.
  warnings: This method assumes the character exists in the cache. If used without
    verifying that the character has been cached first, it may return an invalid or
    zero AccountID. Additionally, this function should not be called during database
    operations that modify character data, as it could lead to inconsistent results
    due to race conditions.
