documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the container of RBAC permissions for the account manager.
  description: The GetRBACPermissionList method returns a constant reference to the
    internal container that holds all Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions
    associated with the account manager. This container is used to manage and enforce
    access control rights for various game features, commands, and administrative
    functions within the TrinityCore framework. The returned container is read-only,
    ensuring that permission data cannot be modified directly through this interface.
    This method is typically invoked during authentication or privilege checking processes
    to validate user permissions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an rbac::RBACPermissionsContainer which contains
    all RBAC permissions assigned to the account manager. The container provides methods
    for checking if a specific permission is granted, iterating through permissions,
    and managing access control lists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check RBAC Permissions
    code: "const rbac::RBACPermissionsContainer& permissions = AccountMgr::GetRBACPermissionList();\n\
      if (permissions.contains(RBAC_PERM_ACCOUNT_GM)) {\n    // Player has GM privileges\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Player is a Game Master\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only view of the RBAC permissions container.
    Modifications to permissions should be done through dedicated permission management
    APIs rather than direct manipulation of this container. The returned reference
    remains valid for the lifetime of the AccountMgr instance.
