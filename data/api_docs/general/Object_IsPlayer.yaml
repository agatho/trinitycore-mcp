documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object represents a player character in the game world.
  description: The IsPlayer method checks if the current Object instance is a player-controlled
    character rather than an NPC or other non-player entity. This method is commonly
    used in game logic to differentiate between player and non-player objects, particularly
    when processing actions or events that should only affect players. The method
    returns true if the object is a player, false otherwise, and is typically used
    in conjunction with other player-specific methods or checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object represents a player character, false if it represents
    an NPC or other non-player entity. This boolean value indicates the type of object
    being checked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Check
    code: "if (object->IsPlayer()) {\n    // Handle player-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Player vs NPC Logic
    code: "if (object->IsPlayer()) {\n    // Perform player-specific actions\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle NPC-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal object type flags and is typically implemented
    using the Object::GetTypeId() method. Performance considerations are minimal as
    it simply performs a type check, but developers should be aware that this method
    may not work correctly with objects that have been modified or restructured in
    certain ways.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an object is a player without
    checking the object's type first, as it may return false positives if the object
    has been modified incorrectly. Also, avoid using this method on objects that are
    not fully initialized.
