  method: hasGameObjectQuestActiveEventExcept
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::hasGameObjectQuestActiveEventExcept(uint32 quest_id,
    uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object quest is active in any event except the specified
    event.
  description: The hasGameObjectQuestActiveEventExcept method determines whether a
    specific quest associated with a game object is currently active within any active
    game event, excluding a particular event ID. This functionality is crucial for
    managing quest availability and event-based content in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server. The method evaluates the current state of game events and their associated
    quests to ensure proper quest gating and event synchronization. It is typically
    used during quest interaction checks or when determining if a quest should be
    available to players based on active events.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check for activity. This must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: event_id
    description: The event ID to exclude from the check. If the quest is active in
      any event except this one, the method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest is active in any game event except
    the excluded event ID; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that the quest should be considered available for interaction based on active
    events.
  examples:
  - title: Check Quest Availability Excluding Specific Event
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->hasGameObjectQuestActiveEventExcept(12345, 678)) {\n\
      \    // Quest 12345 is active in some event except event 678\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal game event system and requires that events
    have been properly initialized. The method performs lookups against active events
    and their associated quests, so performance may be impacted during high-traffic
    periods. It is recommended to cache results when checking frequently accessed
    quests.
  warnings: Ensure that quest_id and event_id parameters are valid identifiers to
    prevent unexpected behavior. This method should not be called during critical
    server initialization phases where event data might not be fully loaded.
