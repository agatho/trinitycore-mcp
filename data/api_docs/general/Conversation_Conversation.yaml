  signature: void Conversation::Conversation()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new conversation instance with default values.
  description: The Conversation constructor initializes a new conversation object,
    setting up internal state and default properties required for managing in-game
    dialogues. This method is typically invoked when creating a new conversation session
    between a player and an NPC or other interactive entity within the World of Warcraft
    environment. The initialization process includes allocating necessary memory,
    setting default dialogue states, and preparing the conversation structure for
    subsequent operations such as adding dialogue lines, handling responses, and managing
    conversation flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new conversation instance
    code: 'Conversation* conv = new Conversation();

      // The conversation is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using conversation in a quest handler
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    Conversation*\
      \ conv = new Conversation();\n    conv->AddDialogLine(12345, \"Hello there,\
      \ adventurer!\");\n    // Proceed with conversation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers; instead,
    it's invoked automatically when creating Conversation objects through the TrinityCore
    API. The object should be properly managed for memory allocation and deallocation
    to prevent leaks. Developers should ensure that conversation instances are initialized
    before any dialogue operations are performed.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the internal
    structure of the Conversation class. Improper initialization can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes during dialogue execution. Always verify that the conversation
    object is properly constructed before adding dialog lines or triggering dialogue
    events.
