  class: CooldownManager
  method: SetCooldownMultiplier
  signature: void CooldownManager::SetCooldownMultiplier(float multiplier)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the global cooldown multiplier for the CooldownManager instance.
  description: The SetCooldownMultiplier method configures a scaling factor that affects
    all cooldowns managed by this CooldownManager instance. This multiplier is applied
    to cooldown durations, allowing for dynamic adjustment of ability recovery times.
    The method modifies internal state to reflect the new multiplier value, which
    will influence subsequent cooldown calculations. This is commonly used in game
    mechanics such as haste effects, temporary buff/debuff modifications, or custom
    gameplay rules that alter cooldown behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: multiplier
    description: A floating-point value representing the cooldown multiplier. A value
      of 1.0 maintains normal cooldowns, values less than 1.0 reduce cooldown duration
      (faster recovery), and values greater than 1.0 increase cooldown duration (slower
      recovery). Must be non-negative.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply 50% faster cooldowns
    code: cooldownManager.SetCooldownMultiplier(0.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Restore normal cooldowns after haste effect ends
    code: cooldownManager.SetCooldownMultiplier(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal multiplier state of the CooldownManager.
    Changes take immediate effect on all subsequent cooldown calculations, but do
    not retroactively affect already active cooldowns. The implementation likely stores
    this value as a member variable and applies it during cooldown duration computations.
  warnings: Setting the multiplier to zero or negative values may produce unexpected
    behavior or infinite cooldowns. Ensure that any external logic properly validates
    input values before calling this method.
