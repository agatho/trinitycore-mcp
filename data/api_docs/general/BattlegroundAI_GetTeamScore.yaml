  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetTeamScore
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundAI::GetTeamScore(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the score of a specific team within the battleground.
  description: The GetTeamScore method returns the current score for a specified team
    in the battleground. This method is typically used by battleground AI systems
    to determine the progress or status of teams during gameplay. The method takes
    an integer pointer as a parameter which likely represents the team ID or player
    index, and returns a uint32 value representing the score. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this method would be integral to tracking team-based objectives
    such as capturing flags, defeating players, or completing mission goals that contribute
    to the overall battleground score.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player or team identifier.
      The value pointed to is typically used to determine which team's score should
      be retrieved.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current score for the specified
    team. A return value of 0 typically indicates no points have been scored, while
    higher values reflect increasing scores based on battleground objectives.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Team Score
    code: "uint32 teamScore = bgAI->GetTeamScore(&playerId);\nif (teamScore > 0) {\n\
      \    // Process the score\n    printf(\"Team score: %u\\n\", teamScore);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetTeamScore in Score Comparison Logic
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nuint32 playerScore = bgAI->GetTeamScore(&playerId);\n\
      playerId = 1;\nuint32 enemyScore = bgAI->GetTeamScore(&playerId);\n\nif (playerScore\
      \ > enemyScore) {\n    // Player's team is winning\n    printf(\"Player team\
      \ is leading with %u points\\n\", playerScore);\n} else if (enemyScore > playerScore)\
      \ {\n    // Enemy team is winning\n    printf(\"Enemy team is leading with %u\
      \ points\\n\", enemyScore);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    during active battleground gameplay. The parameter 'player' likely refers to a
    team identifier rather than an individual player, as battlegrounds typically track
    team scores rather than individual scores. Implementation details may vary depending
    on the specific battleground type (e.g., Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin).
  warnings: Ensure that the pointer passed to this method is valid and points to a
    meaningful team identifier. Passing an invalid or uninitialized value could lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect score retrieval.
