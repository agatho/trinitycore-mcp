  class: Map
  method: IsRemovalGrid
  signature: bool Map::IsRemovalGrid(const Position & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is within the removal grid area of the
    map.
  description: This method checks if a specified Position falls within the boundaries
    of the removal grid for the current map. The removal grid represents an area where
    objects are considered to be removed from the game world, typically used for managing
    object despawn behavior and preventing memory leaks in large maps. This function
    is essential for determining whether a position should trigger removal logic during
    object updates or movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the given position lies within the removal grid boundaries
    of the map, false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the position is
    considered part of the area where objects are removed from the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Map* map = new Map();\nPosition pos;\nbool result = map->IsRemovalGrid(pos);\n\
      if (result)\n    // Position is within removal grid\nelse\n    // Position is\
      \ outside removal grid"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal map grid boundaries and may be affected by
    map-specific configurations. Performance considerations include checking against
    potentially large coordinate values, which could impact efficiency if used frequently
    in loops.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general position checking without understanding
    the specific removal grid boundaries of the map. Using it outside of intended
    contexts may lead to incorrect behavior or memory management issues.
