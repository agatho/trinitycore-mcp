  signature: bool BotPacketRelay::ShouldRelayOpcode(uint32 opcode)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a packet opcode should be relayed by the bot system
  description: The ShouldRelayOpcode method evaluates whether a given packet opcode
    should be processed and forwarded by the bot packet relay system. This method
    is crucial for filtering out unnecessary or potentially harmful packets that bots
    should not forward, ensuring efficient network communication and preventing abuse.
    The method typically checks against an internal whitelist or blacklist of opcodes
    based on game mechanics and security considerations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the opcode should be relayed by the bot system, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling logic
    code: "if (botPacketRelay->ShouldRelayOpcode(opcode)) {\n    // Forward the packet\n\
      \    SendPacketToBot(packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other bot relay logic to maintain
    proper packet flow. It's important to note that the implementation may vary based
    on the specific bot configuration and security policies.
