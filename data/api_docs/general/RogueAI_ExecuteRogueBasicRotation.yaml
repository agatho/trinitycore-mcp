  method: ExecuteRogueBasicRotation
  signature: void RogueAI::ExecuteRogueBasicRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the basic rogue AI rotation logic for target selection and ability
    usage.
  description: The ExecuteRogueBasicRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a rogue AI character. It evaluates the current combat state, selects
    an appropriate target from the available targets, and determines which abilities
    or spells to use based on rogue class mechanics such as energy management, combo
    points, and ability cooldowns. This method is typically called during the AI's
    update cycle to perform routine combat actions. The method assumes that the rogue
    has valid target information and that the AI system is properly initialized with
    necessary data structures for decision making.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID or index within
      the AI's target list. This parameter allows the method to access and manipulate
      the selected target's state during rotation execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n    \n    int targetId = GetTargetId();\n    ExecuteRogueBasicRotation(&targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rogue AI Logic
    code: "void RogueAI::ExecuteRogueBasicRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target < 0)\n        return;\n    \n    Unit* targetUnit = GetUnit(*target);\n\
      \    if (!targetUnit || !targetUnit->IsAlive())\n        return;\n    \n   \
      \ // Basic rotation logic here\n    if (me->HasAura(12345)) // Example aura\
      \ check\n        DoCast(targetUnit, 67890); // Example spell cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should be called only when the
    rogue AI is in combat mode. It assumes that target selection has already been
    handled by higher-level logic, and it focuses solely on executing the rotation
    sequence. Performance considerations include minimizing expensive operations like
    spell checks or aura evaluations during frequent calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    target before calling. Passing an invalid or uninitialized target can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Also, avoid calling this method outside of combat
    context unless properly validated.
