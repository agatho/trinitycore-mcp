  description: The IsVellum method checks if the current item is a vellum, which is
    a specific type of material used in World of Warcraft for enchanting recipes.
    Vellums are typically used to create enchantments on items and are distinguished
    from regular materials by their unique properties and usage in crafting. This
    method returns true when the item has the vellum type, indicating it can be used
    for enchanting purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is a vellum, false otherwise. The method checks
    the item's class and sub-class to determine if it matches the vellum type criteria.

    code: "if (item->IsVellum()) {\n    // Item is a vellum, can be used for enchanting\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's class and sub-class values to determine
    if it is a vellum. The implementation may vary based on how the item was created
    or loaded in memory.
  warnings: Be aware that not all items with vellum-like properties are actually vellums;
    some items might have similar properties but be classified differently. This method
    should be used carefully when checking for specific enchanting materials.
