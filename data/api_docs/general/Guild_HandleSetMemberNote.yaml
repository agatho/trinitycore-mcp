    note, int guid, bool isPublic)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the private or public note for a guild member
  description: The HandleSetMemberNote method updates either a guild member's private
    note or public note based on the isPublic flag. This functionality allows guild
    leaders and officers to maintain personal or shared information about members
    within the guild. The method processes a note string provided by the WorldSession,
    validates the target member's GUID, and stores the note in the guild member's
    record. It ensures that only authorized individuals can modify notes and handles
    both private (visible only to officers) and public (visible to all members) note
    types.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      making the request. Used to verify permissions and identify the requesting player.
  - name: note
    description: String view containing the note text to be set for the guild member.
      The note can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, up to the maximum allowed length
      by the game client.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer representing the global unique identifier (GUID) of the target
      guild member whose note is being modified. Must correspond to an active guild
      member.
  - name: isPublic
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to set the public note (true) or
      private note (false). Public notes are visible to all guild members, while private
      notes are only visible to officers.
  returns: No return value. The method performs the note update operation directly
    and does not return any result.
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Public Note for a Guild Member
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = player->GetSession();\n    std::string_view note = \"Important member\"\
      ;\n    int targetGuid = 123456789;\n    guild->HandleSetMemberNote(session,\
      \ note, targetGuid, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Private Note for a Guild Member
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = player->GetSession();\n    std::string_view note = \"Needs attention\";\n\
      \    int targetGuid = 123456789;\n    guild->HandleSetMemberNote(session, note,\
      \ targetGuid, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling session has appropriate permissions
    to modify notes for the specified guild member. It likely checks if the requesting
    player is a guild leader or officer before allowing modifications. The implementation
    may involve database updates and synchronization with the client UI.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter refers to an actual guild member, as invalid
    GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or errors. Note that note length limits
    are enforced by the client, so extremely long notes might be truncated upon display.
