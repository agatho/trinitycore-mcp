  method: ShouldKite
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldKite() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit should perform a kiting behavior
    based on current combat conditions and threat levels.
  description: The ShouldKite method evaluates the current state of an AI-controlled
    unit to decide if it should engage in kiting behavior, which typically involves
    maintaining distance from enemies while dealing damage or avoiding harmful attacks.
    This decision is influenced by factors such as the unit's health percentage, proximity
    to enemies, available threat levels, and the presence of beneficial auras or abilities
    that may affect combat effectiveness. The method returns true when kiting is deemed
    advantageous for survival or optimal damage output, and false otherwise. It serves
    as a core component in adaptive AI decision-making systems within TrinityCore's
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit should initiate or continue kiting behavior; returns
    false if kiting is not recommended under current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EnemyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() && adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldKite())\n\
      \    {\n        // Initiate kiting behavior\n        DoKite();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "bool EnemyAI::CanEngage()\n{\n    if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldKite())\n\
      \    {\n        // Avoid direct engagement when kiting is preferred\n      \
      \  return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the AI unit, including health
    status, threat levels, and positional data. It should be called regularly during
    AI update cycles to ensure responsive behavior adjustments. The implementation
    may consider factors like enemy attack speed, spell casting times, and the unit's
    own movement capabilities.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or AI update contexts as it
    may return unpredictable results due to uninitialized state variables. Ensure
    that the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance is properly initialized before invoking
    this method.
