documentation:
  brief: Forces an immediate update of all active game events in the world.
  description: The ForceGameEventUpdate method triggers an immediate recalculation
    and synchronization of all currently active game events within the TrinityCore
    world instance. This function is typically used when game event states need to
    be refreshed without waiting for the next scheduled update cycle. It ensures that
    any changes to event conditions, timers, or activation states are instantly reflected
    across all connected clients. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    its operation on the global game event system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Trigger Immediate Game Event Update
    code: World::instance()->ForceGameEventUpdate();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it can cause performance overhead
    by forcing immediate updates to all active game events. It is primarily intended
    for administrative commands or during server maintenance when immediate synchronization
    is required.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently may impact server performance and could
    cause unnecessary network traffic as all clients receive updated event states.
    Avoid using in high-frequency loops or automated systems.
