documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of the game object.
  description: This method retrieves the respawn time of a GameObject, which represents
    the moment when the object will respawn in the world. The returned value is a
    time_t type that indicates the Unix timestamp when the object will reappear. This
    is useful for determining how long a GameObject has been gone or when it will
    return to its original state. In World of Warcraft context, this is typically
    used for managing game object respawns and ensuring proper synchronization with
    server time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the GameObject
    will respawn. This value represents the exact moment in time when the object will
    reappear in the world, or returns 0 if the object has not been set to respawn
    yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = gameobject->GetRespawnTime();\nif (respawnTime > 0)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Respawn time: \" << respawnTime << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not require any special handling. It returns
    the actual Unix timestamp rather than a relative time, making it suitable for
    comparisons with current time values.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with game objects that
    may have been destroyed or removed from the world, as it will return 0 if no respawn
    time has been set. Also note that this value might not reflect actual respawn
    times in all cases, particularly for objects with dynamic respawn timers.
