  method: ThrottleDpsThreat
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ThrottleDpsThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Reduces threat generated by DPS players to prevent excessive aggro buildup.
  description: The ThrottleDpsThreat method applies a throttling mechanism to limit
    the amount of threat that Damage Per Second (DPS) players generate. This is typically
    used in encounter design to ensure that DPS classes do not accumulate too much
    threat too quickly, which could lead to unintended mechanics or unbalanced encounters.
    The method modifies the threat generation rate for DPS players, usually by reducing
    their threat multiplier or applying a cap on threat gains within a specified time
    window. It's commonly invoked during boss fights or scripted events where controlled
    threat distribution is required.

  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Script
    code: "void BossEncounter::OnEngage()\n{\n    // Start throttling DPS threat when\
      \ boss is engaged\n    threatCoordinator.ThrottleDpsThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal threat calculation logic for DPS classes.
    It may be called at specific points during an encounter to adjust difficulty or
    enforce game balance. The throttling effect is usually temporary and reverted
    after the encounter ends.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced encounters or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that threat throttling aligns with the intended encounter design
    and does not inadvertently prevent players from fulfilling their role in combat.
