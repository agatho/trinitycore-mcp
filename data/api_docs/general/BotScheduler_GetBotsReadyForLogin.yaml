  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetBotsReadyForLogin
  signature: int BotScheduler::GetBotsReadyForLogin(uint32 maxCount)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bots ready to log in, up to a specified maximum count.
  description: The GetBotsReadyForLogin method retrieves the count of bots that are
    prepared and eligible to initiate a login process. This method is typically used
    within the context of automated bot management systems in TrinityCore-based World
    of Warcraft servers. It ensures that only bots which have completed their initialization
    steps and are awaiting login are considered. The returned value represents how
    many bots can be logged in at this moment, subject to the provided maximum limit.
    This method does not perform the actual login; it merely evaluates readiness and
    returns a count.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of bots that are ready for login, up
    to the specified maximum count. If no bots are ready or an error occurs, zero
    is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int readyBots = scheduler->GetBotsReadyForLogin(10);

      std::cout << "Number of bots ready to log in: " << readyBots << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Login Logic
    code: "int maxLogins = 5;\nint readyCount = scheduler->GetBotsReadyForLogin(maxLogins);\n\
      if (readyCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with login logic for up to 'readyCount'\
      \ bots\n    for (int i = 0; i < readyCount; ++i)\n    {\n        // Login bot\
      \ at index i\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may interact
    with internal queues or states to determine readiness. It's important to understand
    that this method does not modify any bot state directly; it only evaluates and
    reports the current status.
