documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RoleBasedCombatPositioning instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the RoleBasedCombatPositioning class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources used by the instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and combat system, this class likely
    manages positioning logic based on player roles (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer)
    during combat encounters. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur and
    that any internal data structures are properly deallocated before the object is
    removed from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning* positioning = new RoleBasedCombatPositioning();

      // ... use positioning ...

      delete positioning; // Triggers ~RoleBasedCombatPositioning()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing
    low-level memory management. The class likely contains pointers or containers
    that require proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
