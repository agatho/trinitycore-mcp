  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: SelectByLevelRange
  signature: ZoneChoice BotWorldPositioner::SelectByLevelRange(uint32 level, int faction)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Selects a zone choice based on the specified level and faction for bot positioning.
  description: The SelectByLevelRange method determines an appropriate zone choice
    for a bot based on its level and faction. This method is used in the context of
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to assist with intelligent bot placement
    within game zones. It evaluates available zones and selects one that best matches
    the given criteria, considering both the bot's level range and faction alignment.
    The method ensures that bots are placed in zones where they can effectively engage
    with content appropriate for their level and faction.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot for which to select a zone choice. This determines
      the appropriate zone difficulty and content availability.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the bot (e.g., 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde). Used
      to ensure the selected zone is appropriate for the bot's faction.
  returns: Returns a ZoneChoice object that represents the selected zone choice. This
    object contains information about which zone has been chosen based on level and
    faction criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectByLevelRange
    code: ZoneChoice choice = positioner.SelectByLevelRange(10, 0); // Selects a zone
      for a level 10 Alliance bot
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SelectByLevelRange with different faction
    code: ZoneChoice choice = positioner.SelectByLevelRange(25, 1); // Selects a zone
      for a level 25 Horde bot
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal zone data structures and may cache results
    for performance. The ZoneChoice object returned should be used immediately as
    it might not persist across multiple calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the level parameter is within valid game range to avoid unexpected
    behavior. The faction parameter must correspond to valid faction IDs in the game
    context.
