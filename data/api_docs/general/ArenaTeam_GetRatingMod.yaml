  class: ArenaTeam

  signature: int32 ArenaTeam::GetRatingMod(uint32 ownRating, uint32 opponentRating,
    bool won)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the rating modification for an arena team based on match outcome
    and ratings.
  description: The GetRatingMod method computes the change in rating that should be
    applied to an arena team after a match, taking into account both the team's own
    rating and their opponent's rating. This calculation is used in the World of Warcraft
    arena system to adjust player ratings following competitive matches. The method
    considers whether the team won or lost the match when determining the magnitude
    of the rating change. It implements a standard Elo-like rating adjustment algorithm
    that adjusts for the relative strength of opponents.
  parameters:
  - name: ownRating
    description: The current rating of the arena team performing the calculation
  - name: opponentRating
    description: The rating of the opposing arena team
  - name: won
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the team won (true) or lost (false) the
      match
  returns: Returns the integer change in rating that should be applied to the team.
    Positive values indicate a rating increase, negative values indicate a rating
    decrease. The exact magnitude depends on the relative ratings of both teams and
    whether the match was won or lost.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate rating change for a win
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = ...; // Get reference to arena team

      int32 ratingChange = team->GetRatingMod(1500, 1600, true);

      // ratingChange will be positive since the team won against a higher-rated opponent'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate rating change for a loss
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = ...; // Get reference to arena team

      int32 ratingChange = team->GetRatingMod(1800, 1700, false);

      // ratingChange will be negative since the team lost against a lower-rated opponent'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core arena matchmaking and rating system. The
    implementation likely uses a modified Elo rating system where the expected outcome
    is calculated based on the rating difference between teams, and the actual outcome
    determines the adjustment factor. The exact formula may vary depending on the
    specific arena bracket (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) and game version.
  warnings: This method should only be called after a match has been completed and
    results are finalized. Calling it with invalid ratings or before match completion
    will produce incorrect rating adjustments that could break the arena system's
    balance.
