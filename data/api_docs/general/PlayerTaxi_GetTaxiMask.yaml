documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the player's taxi path mask, which determines
    accessible flight paths.
  description: The GetTaxiMask method retrieves the internal bitmask that represents
    the set of taxi paths (flight paths) known and available to the player. This mask
    is used by the game engine to determine which nodes in the flight map the player
    can access. The returned reference points to an integer value that encodes this
    information using bit flags, where each bit corresponds to a specific taxi path
    or node in the game's flight system. This method does not modify any state and
    is typically used for checking flight path availability or synchronization purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the player's taxi path
    mask. Each bit in this integer corresponds to a specific taxi path, with set bits
    indicating that the player has access to that particular flight path.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific taxi path is available
    code: "if (player->GetTaxiMask() & (1 << 5)) {\n    // Taxi path 5 is available\n\
      \    printf(\"Taxi path 5 is accessible\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug print all known taxi paths
    code: "int mask = player->GetTaxiMask();\nprintf(\"Taxi mask: %d (0x%x)\\n\",\
      \ mask, mask);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\n    if (mask & (1 << i)) {\n\
      \        printf(\"  Path %d is known\\n\", i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The taxi mask is typically populated during character creation and updated
    when players learn new flight paths through quest completion or vendor purchases.
    The bitmask format is internal to TrinityCore's implementation and may vary between
    different versions of the game client. This method returns a const reference,
    so modifying the returned value will not affect the player's actual taxi path
    data.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly manipulating the bitmask values returned by
    this method, as it could lead to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior in
    the flight path system. The mask should be treated as read-only for most use cases.
