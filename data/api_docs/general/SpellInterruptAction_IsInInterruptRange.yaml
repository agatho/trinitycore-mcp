  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: IsInInterruptRange
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::IsInInterruptRange(BotAI * ai, ::Unit * target,
    float requiredRange) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is within the spell interrupt range for the bot AI.
  description: The IsInInterruptRange method determines whether a specified target
    unit is within the required range to interrupt a spell cast by the bot's AI. This
    functionality is crucial for determining when a bot should attempt to interrupt
    enemy spellcasters, such as during combat situations where stopping an opponent's
    spell is necessary. The method evaluates the distance between the bot's AI and
    the target unit using the provided required range parameter, returning true if
    the target is within range and false otherwise. This check is typically used in
    conjunction with other AI decision-making logic to ensure that interrupt actions
    are only attempted when feasible.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and decision-making
      process.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit that may
      be interrupted.
  - name: requiredRange
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which the target must be to
      be considered in interrupt range.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within the specified required range
    for spell interruption, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.IsInInterruptRange(ai, target, 20.0f)) {\n   \
      \ // Attempt to interrupt the target's spell\n    ai->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional interrupt logic
    code: "float interruptRange = 15.0f;\nif (spellInterruptAction.IsInInterruptRange(ai,\
      \ target, interruptRange)) {\n    if (target->IsCasting()) {\n        ai->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data from the AI and target units.
    Performance is generally good as it only performs distance calculations, but frequent
    calls in tight loops should be avoided for optimal efficiency.
