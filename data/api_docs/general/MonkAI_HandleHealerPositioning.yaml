  signature: void MonkAI::HandleHealerPositioning()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the positioning behavior of a Monk AI healer to optimize healing
    effectiveness and safety.
  description: The HandleHealerPositioning method is responsible for controlling how
    a Monk AI character positions itself while performing healing duties. This includes
    determining optimal distance from targets, identifying safe zones to avoid incoming
    damage, and ensuring proper orientation towards the healing target. The method
    evaluates the current combat situation, target health status, and environmental
    factors to make real-time positioning decisions that enhance the monk's ability
    to maintain effective healing output while minimizing vulnerability. It typically
    integrates with the broader AI decision-making system to coordinate movement and
    positioning strategies.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    HandleHealerPositioning();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may interact
    with movement handlers and threat management systems. The positioning decisions
    made by this method are context-dependent and rely on accurate target information
    and environmental awareness.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to ineffective healing
    or unnecessary exposure to danger. The method should not be called in situations
    where the AI character is already engaged in combat actions that might conflict
    with positioning adjustments.
