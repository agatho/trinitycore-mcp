documentation:
  brief: Updates projectile states and mechanics awareness for the current game tick
  description: The UpdateProjectiles method processes all active projectiles within
    the MechanicAwareness system, updating their state and checking for interactions
    with game mechanics such as spell effects, collision detection, and target validation.
    This method is typically called during the game loop's update cycle to ensure
    projectiles behave correctly according to World of Warcraft's combat mechanics.
    It handles projectile lifecycle management including expiration, hit detection,
    and cleanup of invalid projectiles.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    mechanicAwareness.UpdateProjectiles(getMSTime());\n\
      \    // ... more updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game update loop to maintain
    proper projectile behavior. The currentTime parameter is used to determine projectile
    expiration and timing-based effects. Performance is generally low as it only processes
    active projectiles, but can increase during high projectile density situations
    such as area-of-effect spells.
