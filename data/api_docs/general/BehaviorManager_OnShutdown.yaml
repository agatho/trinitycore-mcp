  method: OnShutdown
  signature: void BehaviorManager::OnShutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for all active AI behaviors managed
    by the BehaviorManager.
  description: The OnShutdown method is invoked during server shutdown to gracefully
    terminate and clean up all AI behaviors currently managed by the BehaviorManager.
    This method ensures that any ongoing behavior execution is properly halted, resources
    are released, and state information is preserved where necessary. It typically
    iterates through all registered behaviors and calls their respective cleanup routines.
    The method is designed to be called once during server shutdown sequence to prevent
    memory leaks and ensure proper resource deallocation. No parameters are required
    as the method operates on internal managed behavior instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "void WorldServer::Shutdown()\n{\n    sBehaviorManager->OnShutdown();\n\
      \    // Other shutdown procedures...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown sequence to avoid
    unexpected behavior. It's expected that all behaviors have already been notified
    of the impending shutdown through other mechanisms before this method is invoked.
