  class: ObjectGuid
  method: IsAnyTypeCreature
  signature: bool ObjectGuid::IsAnyTypeCreature() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents any type of creature.
  description: The IsAnyTypeCreature() method checks if the ObjectGuid instance refers
    to a creature object within the World of Warcraft game world. This includes all
    forms of creatures such as NPCs, pets, and hostile or friendly mobs. The method
    evaluates the type portion of the GUID to determine if it matches any of the creature-related
    object types defined in the TrinityCore framework. It is commonly used in game
    logic to filter or process only creature objects from a collection of ObjectGuids.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a creature (including pets, NPCs,
    and mobs), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a GUID represents a creature
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Unit>(12345);\nif (guid.IsAnyTypeCreature())\
      \ {\n    // Process creature-specific logic\n    std::cout << \"This is a creature\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle non-creature objects\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"This is not a creature\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering creatures from a list of ObjectGuids
    code: "std::vector<ObjectGuid> allObjects = GetWorldObjects();\nstd::vector<ObjectGuid>\
      \ creatureObjects;\nfor (const auto& guid : allObjects) {\n    if (guid.IsAnyTypeCreature())\
      \ {\n        creatureObjects.push_back(guid);\n    }\n}\n// Now creatureObjects\
      \ contains only creature GUIDs"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal type encoding of ObjectGuids in TrinityCore.
    The implementation checks against predefined creature type constants and may need
    to be updated if new creature types are added to the codebase. Performance is
    generally fast as it's a simple bitwise comparison operation.
  warnings: Be aware that this method will return false for player GUIDs, even though
    players are technically creatures in some game mechanics. If you specifically
    need to distinguish between player and creature objects, consider using IsPlayer()
    or other more specific type checking methods alongside this one.
