  class: LootDistribution
  method: SetPlayerLootStrategy
  signature: void LootDistribution::SetPlayerLootStrategy(uint32 playerGuid, LootDecisionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot decision strategy for a specific player in the loot distribution
    system.
  description: The SetPlayerLootStrategy method configures how a particular player
    should make loot decisions during group loot scenarios. This method allows administrators
    or game logic to define whether a player will use automatic, master, or other
    loot strategies when participating in loot rolls. The strategy affects how the
    player's actions are interpreted within the context of group loot distribution,
    such as determining whether they will roll need, greed, or pass on items. This
    is particularly relevant for custom loot systems or when implementing specific
    game mechanics that override default behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose loot strategy is
      being set. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: The LootDecisionStrategy enum value that defines how the player will
      make loot decisions. Valid values typically include automatic, master looter,
      need/greed/pass, or other custom strategies defined by the TrinityCore implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's Loot Strategy to Need/Greed
    code: LootDistribution::SetPlayerLootStrategy(12345, LOOT_STRATEGY_NEED_GREED);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Master Looter Strategy for a Player
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      LootDistribution::SetPlayerLootStrategy(playerGuid, LOOT_STRATEGY_MASTER_LOOTER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state within the LootDistribution system
    and may require synchronization with other systems that manage loot assignments.
    It's important to ensure that the player GUID is valid and that the strategy enum
    value corresponds to an implemented decision type in the current TrinityCore version.
  warnings: Setting invalid player GUIDs or unsupported strategy values could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all parameters are validated before calling
    this method, especially in custom modules or scripts.
