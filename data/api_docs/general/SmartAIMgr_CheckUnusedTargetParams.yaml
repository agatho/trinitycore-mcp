  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: CheckUnusedTargetParams
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::CheckUnusedTargetParams(const SmartScriptHolder & e)
documentation:
  brief: Validates that all target parameters in a SmartScriptHolder are properly
    configured and unused.
  description: The CheckUnusedTargetParams method evaluates whether all target parameters
    within a given SmartScriptHolder structure are correctly initialized and not conflicting
    with each other. This function is crucial for ensuring that AI scripts in TrinityCore
    do not contain invalid or redundant target configurations that could lead to unexpected
    behavior during NPC or creature AI execution. It typically runs as part of the
    script validation process before AI scripts are executed in the game world, helping
    maintain consistency and prevent runtime errors caused by malformed target parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all target parameters in the SmartScriptHolder are valid
    and properly configured; returns false if any parameter is invalid, unused, or
    conflicts with others.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script Validation
    code: "SmartScriptHolder scriptHolder;\n// ... populate scriptHolder with target\
      \ parameters ...\nif (sSmartAIMgr->CheckUnusedTargetParams(scriptHolder)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with AI execution\n    sSmartAIMgr->LoadScriptFromHolder(scriptHolder);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log error and skip execution\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid\
      \ target parameters in SmartScriptHolder\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the initialization phase of AI scripts
    to ensure that all target-related fields are properly set before attempting to
    execute any AI actions. It's part of TrinityCore's internal validation system
    and should not be called directly by external modules unless implementing custom
    AI validation logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method on incomplete or uninitialized SmartScriptHolder
    objects, as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all target
    parameters are properly initialized before passing them to this function.
