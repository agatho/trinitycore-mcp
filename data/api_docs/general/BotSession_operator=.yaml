  brief: Moves resources from a source BotSession to this BotSession, leaving the
    source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for BotSession transfers all resources
    owned by the source BotSession to this instance. This operation is typically used
    to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other resources
    without performing deep copies. After the move, the source BotSession will be
    left in a valid state, but its contents are unspecified and should not be relied
    upon. The method is part of the C++ move semantics standard and allows for efficient
    resource management when assigning one BotSession object to another.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to this BotSession instance after the move assignment has completed,
    enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'BotSession session1;

      BotSession session2 = std::move(session1); // Move session1''s resources to
      session2

      // session1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'BotSession session1, session2, session3;

      session3 = std::move(session2) = std::move(session1); // Chained move assignments

      // session1 and session2 are now in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using std::swap or direct resource transfer.
    It's important to note that after a move operation, the source object should not
    be used unless explicitly reset or reassigned. The implementation assumes that
    BotSession manages resources such as memory buffers, file handles, or other system
    resources that can be efficiently transferred rather than copied.
  warnings: Using the source BotSession after a move assignment results in undefined
    behavior. Developers must ensure that no further operations are performed on the
    moved-from object unless it's subsequently reinitialized. This is a common pitfall
    when implementing move semantics.
