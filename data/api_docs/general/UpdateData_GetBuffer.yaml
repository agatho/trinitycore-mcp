  class: UpdateData
  method: GetBuffer
  signature: int & UpdateData::GetBuffer()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal buffer size integer used for tracking
    update data serialization.
  description: The GetBuffer method provides access to an internal integer member
    that represents the current size of the update data buffer. This buffer is used
    in TrinityCore's packet serialization system to track how much data has been written
    during object updates. The returned reference allows direct modification of this
    buffer size value, which is crucial for maintaining accurate packet construction
    and ensuring proper network communication with clients. This method is typically
    used internally by the update system and should be handled carefully to avoid
    corrupting packet data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current buffer size in bytes.
    Modifying this value directly affects the serialized packet size and should only
    be done when managing update data construction.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Buffer Size for Debugging
    code: 'UpdateData updateData;

      // ... populate updateData with data ...

      int& bufferSize = updateData.GetBuffer();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("misc", "Update buffer size: %d bytes", bufferSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Buffer Size During Packet Construction
    code: 'UpdateData updateData;

      // ... prepare update data ...

      int& currentSize = updateData.GetBuffer();

      currentSize += sizeof(uint32); // Account for additional data

      // ... continue with packet construction ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a direct reference to an internal member variable, so
    modifications affect the object's state immediately. The buffer size typically
    represents the total serialized data length and should be managed carefully during
    packet assembly operations.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned reference can corrupt update packet
    data structures if not handled properly. Always ensure that buffer size changes
    align with actual data written to the buffer to maintain packet integrity.
