  class: MonkAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void MonkAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Monk AI behavior when entering combat
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Monk AI creature begins
    combat with a target. This method sets up the initial state and behavior for the
    monk's combat routine, including initializing any necessary variables, resetting
    cooldowns, and preparing the AI to execute combat abilities according to the monk's
    class-specific mechanics. The method ensures that the AI is properly configured
    to engage in combat using appropriate monk abilities such as punches, kicks, and
    defensive maneuvers.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that triggered the start of combat.
      This parameter represents the unit the monk is now fighting against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic OnCombatStart Usage
    code: "void MonkAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    // Initialize combat state\n\
      \    m_combatStarted = true;\n    m_target = target;\n    \n    // Reset any\
      \ cooldowns or counters\n    m_comboPoints = 0;\n    m_lastAbilityTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    \n    // Begin combat routine\n    DoCombatAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a creature enters
    combat. Developers should ensure that all necessary initialization occurs before
    calling any combat-specific functions. The target parameter may be null if the
    combat start was triggered without a valid target.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI system as it may
    cause undefined behavior. Always let the core system handle calling OnCombatStart
    when appropriate.
