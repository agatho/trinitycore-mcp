  class: IBotSession
  method: SimulatePacketReceive
  signature: void IBotSession::SimulatePacketReceive(const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Simulates the reception of a WorldPacket by the bot session, processing it
    as if it were received from the game server.
  description: The SimulatePacketReceive method allows a bot session to artificially
    inject and process a WorldPacket as if it were received from the game server.
    This is commonly used for testing, debugging, or implementing custom bot behaviors
    that require simulating server responses. The method processes the packet through
    the normal packet handling pipeline, invoking appropriate handlers and updating
    internal state as needed. It's particularly useful in development environments
    where you want to test how a bot reacts to specific server messages without requiring
    actual network communication.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPacket object to simulate receiving. This packet should
      contain valid opcode and data that matches the expected format for the target
      server protocol.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Simulation
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345);

      botSession->SimulatePacketReceive(packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Simulating a Server Greeting Packet
    code: 'WorldPacket greeting(SMSG_MOTD, 0);

      greeting.WriteString("Welcome to the server!");

      botSession->SimulatePacketReceive(greeting);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method bypasses normal network reception and directly injects the packet
    into the session's processing queue. It does not send any actual network traffic,
    making it ideal for unit testing or controlled simulation scenarios.
  warnings: Using this method can potentially disrupt normal session state if the
    simulated packet is malformed or inappropriate for the current session state.
    Ensure that packets being simulated are valid and appropriate for the context
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
