  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: GetTrackedRares
  signature: int AdvancedBehaviorManager::GetTrackedRares() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of tracked rare creatures within the AdvancedBehaviorManager's
    scope.
  description: The GetTrackedRares method returns an integer value representing the
    number of rare creatures currently being monitored or tracked by the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    instance. This functionality is typically used in AI behavior scripting to determine
    how many rare NPCs are active in a given area or scenario, which can influence
    decision-making processes for quest tracking, loot distribution, or event activation.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature. It assumes
    that the manager has been properly initialized with tracked rares and that the
    tracking system is functional.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total count of tracked rare creatures.
    A return value of zero means no rare creatures are currently being tracked, while
    positive values represent the actual number of tracked entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Tracked Rares Count
    code: "int trackedCount = behaviorManager.GetTrackedRares();\nif (trackedCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic that depends on rare creatures being tracked\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Currently tracking %d rare creatures.\", trackedCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance
    degradation during regular gameplay. It's recommended that this method be called
    sparingly in high-frequency loops to avoid unnecessary overhead. The returned
    value reflects only those rares explicitly added to the tracking system by the
    manager.
  warnings: The method assumes that internal tracking structures are valid and initialized.
    Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured AdvancedBehaviorManager
    instance may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
