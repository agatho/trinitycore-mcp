documentation:
  brief: Manages the evoker's essence spending behavior for balance abilities.
  description: The BalanceEssenceSpending method controls how an evoker AI spends
    its essence resources when using balance-oriented spells and abilities. This method
    evaluates the current state of the evoker's essence pool, determines optimal usage
    timing, and executes appropriate essence-based actions to maintain effective gameplay
    balance. It is typically invoked during the AI's update cycle to ensure proper
    resource management for balance class mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   BalanceEssenceSpending();\n    // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the evoker's core AI decision-making process and should
    be called regularly during the AI update loop. The implementation likely considers
    factors such as target health, available essence amount, spell cooldowns, and
    combat situation to make optimal spending decisions.
