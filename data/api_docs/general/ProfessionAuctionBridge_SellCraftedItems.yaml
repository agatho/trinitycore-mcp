  method: SellCraftedItems
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SellCraftedItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sells crafted items from a player's inventory through the auction house system.
  description: The SellCraftedItems method processes and auctions crafted items owned
    by a specified player. It iterates through the player's inventory, identifies
    crafted items that are eligible for auction, and creates auction listings for
    them on the auction house. This method is typically invoked during auction house
    operations or when a player attempts to sell their crafted goods. The method handles
    item validation, pricing calculations, and auction creation within the TrinityCore
    framework. It ensures that only valid crafted items are auctioned and respects
    auction house rules and cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's crafted items will be processed
      for auction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionAuctionBridge bridge;

      bridge.SellCraftedItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID is valid and that the player object
    exists in the game world. The actual auction creation process may involve database
    transactions and network updates. Performance may be impacted when processing
    large inventories or during high-traffic server periods.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player is online and has a valid session
    before invoking this method. The method does not validate item quality or enchantments,
    so crafted items must be properly configured before auctioning.
