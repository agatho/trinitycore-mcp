  signature: void EvokerAI::CastDreamBreath(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Dream Breath spell cast for the evoker AI, targeting the specified
    unit.
  description: The CastDreamBreath method is responsible for executing the Dream Breath
    ability within the EvokerAI class. This method handles the logic required to cast
    the Dream Breath spell on a designated target, which is typically a player or
    creature within the evoker's vicinity. The implementation likely includes checks
    for valid targets, spell cooldowns, mana requirements, and proper targeting mechanics.
    It is part of the evoker's core AI behavior system, enabling the NPC to utilize
    this specific ability during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This parameter specifies which entity will be targeted by the Dream Breath spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastDreamBreath
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      this->CastDreamBreath(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked internally by the evoker AI's decision-making
    process, possibly in response to combat conditions or specific event triggers.
    The actual spell casting behavior and targeting logic would be handled by underlying
    TrinityCore systems.
