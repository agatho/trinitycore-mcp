documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum and maximum X-axis values for a specified curve ID
    from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetCurveXAxisRange method fetches the range of X-axis values associated
    with a given curve identifier from the DB2 database. This is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft's animation and data systems where curves define various properties
    such as movement speed, health regeneration, or spell effects over time. The returned
    pair represents the lower and upper bounds of the X-axis for that specific curve,
    which helps determine valid input ranges when evaluating curve functions. The
    method assumes the curve ID exists within the loaded DB2 data structures and will
    return a default range if not found.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<float, float> where the first element is the minimum X-axis
    value and the second element is the maximum X-axis value for the specified curve.
    If no valid data exists for the curve ID, both values may be zero or undefined.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve X-axis range for a curve
    code: 'uint32 curveId = 12345;

      std::pair<float, float> range = sDB2Manager->GetCurveXAxisRange(curveId);

      printf("X-axis range: [%f, %f]\n", range.first, range.second);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data caching and assumes that the curve
    data has already been loaded into memory. Performance is generally fast due to
    in-memory lookups but depends on how many curves are cached.
