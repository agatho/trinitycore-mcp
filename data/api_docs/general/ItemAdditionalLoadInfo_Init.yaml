  class: ItemAdditionalLoadInfo
  method: Init
  signature: void ItemAdditionalLoadInfo::Init(int * loadInfo, int artifactResult,
    int azeriteItemResult, int azeriteItemMilestonePowersResult, int azeriteItemUnlockedEssencesResult,
    int azeriteEmpoweredItemResult)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the ItemAdditionalLoadInfo object with artifact and azerite-related
    data.
  description: The Init method prepares an ItemAdditionalLoadInfo object for use by
    loading and storing various artifact and azerite-related data from the provided
    integer parameters. This method is typically called during item loading processes
    in TrinityCore to ensure that artifact powers, azerite item properties, and related
    milestone information are correctly initialized. The method does not return any
    value but sets internal state based on the input parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: loadInfo
    description: Pointer to an array of integers containing general load information
      for the item.
  - name: artifactResult
    description: Integer representing the artifact result data, likely containing
      artifact power or trait information.
  - name: azeriteItemResult
    description: Integer containing azerite item specific data such as azerite levels
      or item properties.
  - name: azeriteItemMilestonePowersResult
    description: Integer storing milestone power data for the azerite item, indicating
      unlocked powers at certain milestones.
  - name: azeriteItemUnlockedEssencesResult
    description: Integer representing unlocked azerite essences associated with the
      item.
  - name: azeriteEmpoweredItemResult
    description: Integer containing data related to empowered azerite item properties
      or effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of ItemAdditionalLoadInfo
    code: 'int loadInfo[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

      ItemAdditionalLoadInfo info;

      info.Init(loadInfo, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal item loading system in TrinityCore. It's
    typically invoked during database loading or when a player interacts with an artifact
    or azerite item. The parameters are expected to be properly formatted integers
    from the game's data sources.
