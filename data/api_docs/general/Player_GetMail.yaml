documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific mail item from the player's mailbox by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetMail method allows players to retrieve a specific mail item
    from their mailbox using its unique identifier (GUID). This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft development to access mail items that have been received
    by the player, particularly when handling mail-related events or processing mail
    data. The method returns a pointer to the Mail object if found, or nullptr if
    no mail with the specified ID exists in the player's mailbox.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Mail object corresponding to the given ID, or
    nullptr if no such mail exists in the player's mailbox. The returned Mail object
    contains all relevant information about the mail item including sender, subject,
    content, and associated items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Mail *mail = player->GetMail(123456789012345678ULL);\nif (mail != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process mail\n    std::cout << \"Mail found: \" << mail->GetSubject()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mailbox-related methods
    to manage player mail. It's important to note that the returned Mail object may
    be nullptr if no mail exists with the specified ID, so proper null checking should
    always be performed before accessing any mail properties.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to memory access
    violations if used improperly. Ensure that the mail ID is valid and that the player's
    mailbox has been properly initialized before calling this method. Also note that
    this method does not automatically remove the mail from the mailbox, so developers
    should be aware of potential memory leaks.
