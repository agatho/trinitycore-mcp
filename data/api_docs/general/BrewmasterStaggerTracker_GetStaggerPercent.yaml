  method: GetStaggerPercent
  signature: float BrewmasterStaggerTracker::GetStaggerPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current stagger percentage of the Brewmaster.
  description: The GetStaggerPercent method computes the percentage of stagger damage
    currently applied to the Brewmaster character. This value represents how much
    of the character's maximum health is being affected by the stagger effect, which
    occurs when the Brewmaster takes damage while under the influence of the Stagger
    effect. The returned value is a floating-point number between 0.0 and 100.0, where
    0.0 indicates no stagger and 100.0 indicates maximum stagger. This method is typically
    used for UI display purposes or to determine when certain abilities should be
    triggered based on the stagger level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current stagger percentage, ranging from
    0.0 (no stagger) to 100.0 (maximum stagger).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for UI Display
    code: "float staggerPercent = player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker()->GetStaggerPercent();\n\
      // Use staggerPercent to update a UI element showing stagger level\nif (staggerPercent\
      \ >= 50.0f)\n{\n    // Trigger visual warning or alert\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "BrewmasterStaggerTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker();\n\
      float percent = tracker->GetStaggerPercent();\nif (percent >= 75.0f)\n{\n  \
      \  // Activate a defensive ability that reduces stagger\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_STAGGER_REDUCTION, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no direct calculations but relies on internal state
    tracking of the Brewmaster's stagger damage. The value returned may be cached
    or updated only at specific intervals during combat. The method is safe to call
    from any thread context, though it should generally be called from the main game
    thread for consistency.
  warnings: The returned percentage may not immediately reflect changes in stagger
    status if the internal state has not been updated yet. In high-frequency scenarios,
    consider caching the result to avoid redundant calls to this method.
