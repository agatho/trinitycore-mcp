  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the combat behavior integration state to its initial conditions.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the internal state of
    the CombatBehaviorIntegration class, typically clearing any active combat-related
    flags, timers, or tracked data. This method is commonly invoked when a creature
    or player enters a new combat phase, transitions between states, or when the AI
    system requires a clean slate for behavior execution. It ensures that all combat-related
    variables are reset to their default values, allowing the integration to properly
    respond to subsequent combat triggers and events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration combatBehavior;

      combatBehavior.Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new combat interaction or
    after completing one to ensure clean state management. It is typically invoked
    internally by the AI system but can also be manually triggered during custom behavior
    implementations.
