documentation:
  brief: Sends the bank list for a specified guild tab to the player's client.
  description: The SendBankList method is responsible for transmitting the contents
    of a specific guild bank tab to a connected player's client. This method is typically
    invoked when a player opens their guild bank interface or requests a refresh of
    a particular tab's contents. It ensures that the client displays the correct items,
    their quantities, and positions within the specified tab. The method supports
    both full updates and partial updates depending on the 'fullUpdate' parameter.
    This functionality is integral to the World of Warcraft guild banking system,
    allowing players to manage shared resources effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the connected player's
      session. Used to identify which client should receive the bank list data.
  - name: tabId
    description: The identifier of the guild bank tab to send. Valid values range
      from 0 to the maximum number of tabs configured for the guild, typically up
      to 9 (0-8). Tab ID 0 usually represents the main bank tab.
  - name: fullUpdate
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send a full update (true) or a
      partial update (false). A full update sends all items in the tab, while a partial
      update may only send changes since the last update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Full Bank List for Tab 0
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendBankList(player->GetSession(),\
      \ 0, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Partial Update for Tab 2
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendBankList(player->GetSession(),\
      \ 2, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles serialization of item data and packet construction
    for transmission. It is designed to be called from within the game's main thread
    context. The tabId parameter should always be validated against the guild's actual
    number of tabs to prevent out-of-bounds access.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid tabId can lead to undefined behavior
    or client-side crashes. Ensure that tabId is within valid range (0 to max_tabs
    - 1). Also, note that sending a full update for large bank tabs may cause performance
    degradation if not handled carefully.
