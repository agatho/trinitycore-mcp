documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the spawn priority queue is empty
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if the SpawnPriorityQueue contains any
    elements. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation to manage object spawning priorities, particularly for creatures,
    game objects, and other entities that need to be spawned in a specific order based
    on priority levels. The method performs a constant-time check by examining the
    internal state of the queue without modifying it. It returns true if no items
    are present in the queue, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spawn priority queue contains no elements; returns
    false if the queue has one or more elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check queue state
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue queue;\nif (queue.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Handle case when\
      \ queue is empty\n    printf(\"Queue is empty\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ case when queue has elements\n    printf(\"Queue contains elements\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty in spawn logic
    code: "void ProcessSpawns() {\n    static SpawnPriorityQueue spawnQueue;\n   \
      \ \n    if (spawnQueue.IsEmpty()) {\n        // No more spawns to process\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Process next spawn from queue\n    auto\
      \ nextSpawn = spawnQueue.Pop();\n    // ... handle spawn logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the server
    code where checking queue state needs to be fast. The implementation likely uses
    a simple counter or boolean flag internally for O(1) time complexity. It's safe
    to call from multiple threads if the underlying queue structure is thread-safe.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where race conditions
    might occur. If another thread modifies the queue between checking IsEmpty and
    performing an operation, the state may have changed. Consider using locks or atomic
    operations for thread safety in multi-threaded contexts.
