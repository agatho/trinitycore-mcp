  signature: void Guild::SendEventPresenceChanged(WorldSession * session, bool loggedOn,
    bool broadcast) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event presence changed message to the specified session.
  description: The SendEventPresenceChanged method is used to notify a player's session
    about changes in their guild member's online status. This method is typically
    invoked when a player logs in or out of the game, or when their presence in the
    guild changes in some way. It allows the client to update the guild roster and
    member status indicators accordingly. The broadcast parameter determines whether
    this notification should be sent to all guild members or just the specific session
    provided.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player who will receive the presence
      change notification. This session must be valid and associated with a logged-in
      player.
  - name: loggedOn
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player is currently logged in
      (true) or logged out (false).
  - name: broadcast
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the presence change should be broadcast
      to all guild members (true) or only sent to the specified session (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send presence change for a logged-in player
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendEventPresenceChanged(player->GetSession(),\
      \ true, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast presence change to all guild members
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendEventPresenceChanged(player->GetSession(),\
      \ false, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild management system and should only
    be called when a player's presence status changes. It does not directly modify
    any persistent data but rather sends a network message to update client-side UI
    elements.
  warnings: Ensure that the session pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null session could lead to undefined behavior. Also, avoid calling this
    method excessively during login/logout sequences to prevent network flooding.
