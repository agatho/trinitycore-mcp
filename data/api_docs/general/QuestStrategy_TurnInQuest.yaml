  method: TurnInQuest
  signature: void QuestStrategy::TurnInQuest(BotAI * ai, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a specified quest for the bot character using the provided AI context.
  description: The TurnInQuest method is responsible for handling the completion of
    a quest by a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a BotAI
    instance and a quest identifier as inputs, and performs the necessary actions
    to turn in the quest, such as interacting with quest givers, submitting required
    items, or fulfilling quest objectives. This method is typically used in automated
    questing scripts or AI behaviors where bots need to progress through quests without
    manual player intervention. The method assumes that the bot has already met all
    prerequisites for completing the quest and focuses solely on the finalization
    process.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot character's behavior
      and decision-making process. This AI context provides access to the bot's inventory,
      location, and other relevant state information needed for quest completion.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to be turned in. This value corresponds
      to the Quest ID used internally by the TrinityCore database to identify specific
      quests within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: "void MyQuestingAI::CompleteQuest(BotAI* ai, uint32 questId)\n{\n    QuestStrategy\
      \ strategy;\n    strategy.TurnInQuest(ai, questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In
    code: "void AdvancedQuestingAI::ProcessQuestCompletion(BotAI* ai, uint32 questId)\n\
      {\n    if (ai->GetBot()->HasQuest(questId))\n    {\n        QuestStrategy strategy;\n\
      \        strategy.TurnInQuest(ai, questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation to check if the bot has completed
    all quest requirements before attempting to turn in the quest. It is expected
    that the calling code ensures the quest can be turned in. The implementation may
    involve multiple internal steps including NPC interaction, item submission, and
    quest status updates within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the bot meets all quest completion
    criteria may result in unexpected behavior or failed quest completion. Additionally,
    this method should not be called from within a context where quest completion
    might cause race conditions or state inconsistencies.
