  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: Update
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt coordinator's internal state based on the elapsed game
    time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing interrupt-related
    logic within the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class. It typically handles the timing
    and execution of interrupts, such as spell interruptions or ability cancellations,
    based on the delta time (diff) passed to it. This method is called regularly by
    the game loop to ensure that interrupt conditions are checked and applied in a
    timely manner. The implementation likely manages cooldowns, interrupt timers,
    and state transitions for various interruptible actions within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed for interrupt timing calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetGameTimeDiff();\n    interruptCoordinator.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Interrupt Logic
    code: "class MyInterruptHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Process interrupt conditions based on time passed\n       \
      \ if (interruptTimer > 0)\n        {\n            interruptTimer -= diff;\n\
      \            if (interruptTimer <= 0)\n            {\n                HandleInterrupt();\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    uint32 interruptTimer = 0;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or AI update cycle.
    It's crucial that the diff parameter accurately reflects the actual time passed
    to maintain consistent interrupt behavior across different frame rates and system
    performance conditions.
