  class: Creature
  method: ReleaseSpellFocus
  signature: void Creature::ReleaseSpellFocus(const int * focusSpell, bool withDelay)
documentation:
  brief: Releases spell focus for a creature, allowing it to continue with normal
    spell casting behavior.
  description: This method releases the spell focus that was previously set on a creature,
    enabling it to resume normal spell casting operations. The method allows for optional
    delay handling, which can be used to control when the release occurs. It is typically
    used in conjunction with spell focus management to ensure proper creature behavior
    during spell casting sequences. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    game mechanics integrity and preventing conflicts between spell focus states and
    normal casting behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: focusSpell
    description: Pointer to the spell ID that was previously set as focus. This parameter
      determines which specific spell focus is being released, allowing for precise
      control over the release process.
  - name: withDelay
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply a delay before releasing
      the spell focus. When true, the release occurs after a specified delay; when
      false, the release happens immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->ReleaseSpellFocus(nullptr, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Delay Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->ReleaseSpellFocus(&spellId, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects spell casting behavior.
    It is recommended to ensure that the spell focus has been properly set before
    calling this method. The implementation may involve thread synchronization depending
    on how the spell focus is managed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent spell casting behavior
    or unexpected creature actions during spell execution. Care must be taken when
    dealing with spell focus states to avoid conflicts with normal casting operations.
