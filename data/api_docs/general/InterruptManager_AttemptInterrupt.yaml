  method: AttemptInterrupt
  signature: InterruptResult InterruptManager::AttemptInterrupt(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interrupt a target's current spell casting.
  description: The AttemptInterrupt method evaluates whether a given target can be
    interrupted based on game mechanics and internal state checks. It returns an InterruptResult
    indicating success or failure of the interruption attempt. This method is typically
    used during combat when a player or creature needs to break another unit's ongoing
    spell cast, such as when taking damage or being affected by certain abilities.
    The method considers factors like spell type, casting time, and interruptibility
    rules defined in the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an InterruptResult enum value that indicates whether the interruption
    was successful, failed due to immunity, or failed for other reasons such as the
    target not being in a castable state. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED_IMMUNE,
    FAILED_NOT_CASTING, or similar based on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Attempt
    code: "InterruptTarget target = GetTarget();\nInterruptResult result = interruptManager.AttemptInterrupt(target);\n\
      if (result == InterruptResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Handle successful interruption\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Spell interrupted!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against target's current spell state,
    including whether they are casting a spell that can be interrupted. The implementation
    may involve checking for specific spell attributes or aura effects that prevent
    interruption.
  warnings: Ensure the target is valid and in a proper state before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. Calling this on invalid targets could
    lead to undefined behavior.
