  method: SetActive
  signature: void GroupFormation::SetActive(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates the group formation system
  description: The SetActive method enables or disables the group formation system
    within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality controls whether players
    can form groups, join existing groups, or participate in group-based activities
    such as raids or dungeons. When activated, the system allows normal group operations;
    when deactivated, group creation and joining is typically restricted or disabled.
    The method directly modifies an internal state flag that governs group formation
    behavior across the server.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the group formation system
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Group Formation
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = sObjectMgr->GetGroupFormation();

      formation->SetActive(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate Group Formation During Maintenance
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = sObjectMgr->GetGroupFormation();

      formation->SetActive(false);

      // Prevents new groups from being created during server maintenance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies an internal flag that affects group creation and management
    throughout the server. It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments
    where group operations are ongoing. Changes take effect immediately without requiring
    a restart or reload of any subsystem.
  warnings: Calling this method while active groups exist may cause unexpected behavior
    or errors if not properly synchronized with ongoing group operations. Ensure that
    no players are actively forming or joining groups when toggling this setting.
