  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: OnSpawnCompleted
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::OnSpawnCompleted(bool success, int guid, const
    int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Handles completion of bot spawning operations and updates internal state
    accordingly
  description: The OnSpawnCompleted method is invoked when a bot spawning operation
    has finished, either successfully or with failure. It processes the result of
    the spawn attempt, updating the orchestrator's internal tracking of spawned bots
    and potentially triggering subsequent actions based on the success or failure
    of the operation. This method plays a crucial role in the bot management system
    by ensuring proper state transitions and cleanup after spawn operations. The method
    is typically called as a callback from asynchronous spawn processes within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the bot spawning operation completed
      successfully (true) or failed (false)
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the spawned bot entity, or -1 if
      the operation failed
  - name: request
    description: Reference to an integer representing the original spawn request identifier
      used to track this specific spawning operation
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn completion handler
    code: "void BotSpawnOrchestrator::OnSpawnCompleted(bool success, int guid, const\
      \ int & request)\n{\n    if (success)\n    {\n        // Mark bot as successfully\
      \ spawned\n        m_spawnedBots[guid] = true;\n        sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ with GUID %d spawned successfully.\", guid);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n   \
      \     // Handle spawn failure\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to spawn bot\
      \ for request %d\", request);\n        m_pendingRequests.erase(request);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from asynchronous contexts, so thread
    safety considerations should be taken into account when accessing shared data
    structures. The method assumes that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an actual bot entity if success is true.
  warnings: Ensure that all internal state updates are properly synchronized if this
    method can be called from multiple threads. Failure to handle race conditions
    may lead to inconsistent bot tracking or memory corruption.
