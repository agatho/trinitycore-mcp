  class: GuildBankManager
  method: CleanupBankTabs
  signature: void GuildBankManager::CleanupBankTabs(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Cleans up guild bank tabs by removing invalid or orphaned entries from the
    database.
  description: The CleanupBankTabs method is responsible for maintaining data integrity
    within the guild bank system by identifying and removing invalid or orphaned bank
    tab entries. This typically occurs when a guild member leaves the guild, or when
    there are inconsistencies in the bank tab data structure that could lead to errors
    or data corruption. The method ensures that only valid bank tabs associated with
    active guild members are retained in the database. It may also handle cleanup
    of related item data and update internal references accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID or GUID. This parameter
      is used to identify which specific player's bank tab data should be cleaned
      up, though its exact usage may depend on implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.CleanupBankTabs(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or during guild member removal
    to maintain database consistency. The cleanup process may involve database transactions
    and could impact performance if dealing with large amounts of data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper player identification may result
    in unintended data loss. Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid guild
    member before calling this function.
