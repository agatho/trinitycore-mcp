  method: IsGhoulActive
  signature: bool UnholyPetTracker::IsGhoulActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unholy ghoul pet is currently active and under the
    player's control.
  description: The IsGhoulActive method checks the current state of the player's unholy
    ghoul pet, returning true if the ghoul is actively summoned and controlled by
    the player, and false otherwise. This method is typically used in the context
    of Death Knight specialization, where the unholy tree grants access to a ghoul
    that can be commanded to perform various actions such as attacking enemies or
    following the player. The method does not consider whether the ghoul is in combat
    or idle, only whether it exists in an active state within the game world. This
    check is essential for determining valid interactions with the pet and ensuring
    proper behavior of abilities that rely on the ghoul's presence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unholy ghoul is currently active and under player control,
    false if the ghoul is not summoned or has been dismissed/deactivated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check ghoul status
    code: "if (player->GetUnholyPetTracker()->IsGhoulActive()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ that require an active ghoul\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_GHOUL_ATTACK,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Death Knight ability check
    code: "void DeathKnight::HandleGhoulAbility() {\n    if (UnholyPetTracker* tracker\
      \ = GetUnholyPetTracker()) {\n        if (tracker->IsGhoulActive()) {\n    \
      \        // Execute ghoul-based spell or action\n            CastSpell(SPELL_GHOUL_FRENZY);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Handle case where ghoul is not active\n  \
      \          SendSystemMessage(\"Your ghoul is not active.\");\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the pet within the UnholyPetTracker
    class. It may return false if the ghoul has been dismissed, died, or if the player
    has switched to a different specialization that does not support unholy pets.
    The method does not account for temporary invisibility or other visual states
    of the pet, only its active summoning status.
  warnings: Do not assume that an active ghoul will remain active throughout all game
    states. The ghoul may be dismissed by certain abilities, environmental effects,
    or player actions. Always verify the ghoul's active state before performing actions
    that depend on its presence to avoid potential errors or unexpected behavior.
