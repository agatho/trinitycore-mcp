documentation:
  brief: Moves the LFGBotManager instance to another LFGBotManager object, transferring
    ownership of resources.
  description: The operator= method implements move assignment for the LFGBotManager
    class. It transfers all resources and state from the source LFGBotManager object
    (passed as an rvalue reference) to the current object. This operation is typically
    used when assigning one LFGBotManager instance to another, allowing efficient
    resource transfer without deep copying. The source object becomes invalid after
    the move operation and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG
    (Looking for Group) system, this method facilitates efficient management of LFG
    bot instances during assignment or reassignment operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another LFGBotManager instance whose resources
      will be moved to this object. After the operation, param0 will be left in a
      valid but unspecified state.
  returns: A reference to the current LFGBotManager object (this) after the move assignment
    has completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LFGBotManager manager1;

      LFGBotManager manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses operator=

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "LFGBotManager createManager() {\n    LFGBotManager mgr;\n    // Initialize\
      \ manager...\n    return mgr; // Move semantics used during return\n}\n\nLFGBotManager\
      \ mainManager = createManager(); // Move assignment occurs here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's designed
    to be efficient and avoid unnecessary copying of resources. The LFGBotManager
    class likely manages dynamic memory or system resources that benefit from move
    semantics rather than copy semantics.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source object (param0) should not be
    used as its state becomes undefined. Attempting to use the moved-from object may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes.
