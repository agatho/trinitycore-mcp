  brief: Processes loot roll events for bot characters in the game world
  description: The ProcessLootRoll method handles loot distribution decisions when
    a bot character participates in a loot roll. It evaluates the current loot event,
    considers the bot's inventory status and loot preferences, and makes appropriate
    decisions such as rolling need, greed, or pass on items. This method integrates
    with TrinityCore's loot system to ensure bots behave appropriately during group
    loot scenarios, taking into account item quality, player class, and configured
    bot settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI processing loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_lootEvent)\n    {\n        ProcessLootRoll(*m_lootEvent);\n\
      \        m_lootEvent = nullptr;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle when a loot event
    is pending. It assumes that the bot has proper access to the loot context and
    that the LootEvent object contains valid data about the item being rolled for,
    including item quality, required skill levels, and available roll options.
  warnings: Improper handling of loot events may cause bots to make invalid rolls
    or miss opportunities to acquire valuable items. Ensure that the LootEvent is
    properly initialized before calling this method, as accessing invalid data can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
