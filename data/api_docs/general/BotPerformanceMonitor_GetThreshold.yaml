  signature: uint64_t BotPerformanceMonitor::GetThreshold(MetricType type, AlertLevel
    level) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threshold value for a specified performance metric and alert
    level.
  description: 'The GetThreshold method retrieves the configured threshold value for
    a given performance metric type and alert level. This method is used by the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class to determine when performance metrics have crossed acceptable limits, triggering
    appropriate alerts or actions. The method takes two parameters: MetricType which
    specifies the type of performance metric being monitored (e.g., CPU usage, memory
    consumption, update time), and AlertLevel which indicates the severity level (e.g.,
    warning, critical) for which the threshold should be retrieved. The returned uint64_t
    value represents the threshold limit in the appropriate units for that specific
    metric type. This method is typically called during performance monitoring checks
    to compare current values against established thresholds.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64_t value representing the threshold limit for the specified
    metric type and alert level. The actual meaning of this value depends on the metric
    type (e.g., milliseconds for time-based metrics, bytes for memory metrics, percentage
    for utilization metrics). A return value of 0 typically indicates that no threshold
    has been configured for the given combination of metric type and alert level.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve CPU usage warning threshold
    code: uint64_t cpuWarningThreshold = monitor.GetThreshold(MetricType::CPU_USAGE,
      AlertLevel::WARNING);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check memory consumption thresholds for different alert levels
    code: 'uint64_t memWarning = monitor.GetThreshold(MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE, AlertLevel::WARNING);

      uint64_t memCritical = monitor.GetThreshold(MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE, AlertLevel::CRITICAL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a lookup operation in an internal configuration
    map or table. The performance of this method should be minimal since it's typically
    just a map lookup. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify
    the state of the BotPerformanceMonitor object. It's expected that valid MetricType
    and AlertLevel values are passed to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid MetricType or AlertLevel values may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect threshold values. Ensure that only valid enum
    values from the MetricType and AlertLevel enumerations are used. The returned
    value should not be interpreted without understanding the specific units and meaning
    associated with each metric type.
