  brief: Dumps the contents of the combat event queue to the console or log for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending combat events currently
    stored in the CombatEventBus queue. This utility function is primarily used for
    debugging and development to inspect the state of active combat events without
    modifying them. The method does not alter the contents of the queue and simply
    serializes the event data for display. It is typically invoked during development
    or when troubleshooting combat-related issues within the TrinityCore framework.
