  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetDeathKnightDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the defensive cooldowns for a Death Knight player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetDeathKnightDefensiveCooldowns method retrieves the current defensive
    cooldown values for a Death Knight class player within PvP combat scenarios. This
    method is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to determine the availability
    of defensive abilities such as Death Strike, Bone Shield, or other defensive spells
    that are crucial for survival in player-versus-player encounters. The returned
    value represents the number of active defensive cooldowns or a status code indicating
    the state of these abilities. This functionality is integral to AI decision-making
    processes in PvP situations where timing and resource management are critical.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or internal
      state. This parameter is expected to contain a valid player reference that the
      method uses to query defensive cooldown information.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of active defensive cooldowns
    for the Death Knight, or a status code if no cooldowns are available or an error
    occurs. A positive value indicates active cooldowns, zero means no cooldowns,
    and negative values may indicate errors or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerID = 12345;\nint cooldownCount = ai->GetDeathKnightDefensiveCooldowns(&playerID);\n\
      if (cooldownCount > 0) {\n    // Death Knight has defensive cooldowns active\n\
      \    printf(\"Active defensive cooldowns: %d\\n\", cooldownCount);\n} else if\
      \ (cooldownCount == 0) {\n    // No defensive cooldowns are active\n    printf(\"\
      No defensive cooldowns active\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerID = 12345;\nint result = ai->GetDeathKnightDefensiveCooldowns(&playerID);\n\
      if (result < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Error retrieving defensive\
      \ cooldowns: %d\\n\", result);\n} else if (result == 0) {\n    // No cooldowns,\
      \ safe to use defensive abilities\n    printf(\"All defensive abilities available\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Some cooldowns are active\n    printf(\"Defensive cooldowns\
      \ active: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and assumes that the player
    parameter points to a valid Death Knight in a PvP context. The actual implementation
    may vary based on TrinityCore's AI framework version and specific PvP combat rules.
    Performance-wise, this call should be lightweight as it only queries internal
    cooldown states.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active Death
    Knight in a PvP environment; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results
    or cause undefined behavior. The returned integer values should be interpreted
    carefully as they might represent different states depending on the AI implementation.
