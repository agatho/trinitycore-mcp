  class: GenericMovementGenerator
  method: MovementInform
  signature: void GenericMovementGenerator::MovementInform(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the movement generator that a movement has completed for the specified
    unit.
  description: The MovementInform method is called when a unit's movement has been
    completed, typically as part of the AI or movement system. It allows the movement
    generator to react to the completion of a specific movement action, such as reaching
    a destination or finishing a path. This method is crucial for chaining movements,
    triggering follow-up actions, or updating the state of the unit's AI behavior.
    The method accepts a pointer to the Unit that has completed its movement and is
    expected to handle any necessary cleanup or state transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit instance whose movement has been completed. This
      parameter represents the target unit for which the movement inform event is
      being triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom movement generator
    code: "class CustomMovementGenerator : public GenericMovementGenerator\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    void MovementInform(Unit* unit) override\n    {\n        // Handle the\
      \ completion of movement for the given unit\n        if (unit)\n        {\n\
      \            // Perform actions after movement is complete\n            unit->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_IMMUNE_TO_PC);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core movement system when a movement
    operation finishes. It should be implemented to handle state transitions or trigger
    subsequent AI behaviors without blocking the main thread. The unit pointer passed
    in must be valid and not null, as it represents the entity whose movement has
    concluded.
  warnings: Do not assume that the unit is still alive or in a valid state when this
    method is called. Ensure proper null checks and validity checks before performing
    operations on the unit. Improper handling of this callback may lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior.
