  brief: Adds a loot roll to the player's loot list for processing.
  description: The AddLootRoll method is used to add a LootRoll object to the player's
    internal loot tracking system. This method allows players to participate in loot
    rolling for items that are being distributed, typically within a group or raid
    context. The method ensures that the loot roll is properly registered and will
    be processed according to the game's loot distribution rules. It is commonly used
    during loot generation and distribution events where players need to add their
    rolls to the system.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      LootRoll* roll = new LootRoll();

      player->AddLootRoll(roll);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot generation events, such as when
    a player receives a loot item or when a group member participates in a loot roll.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly handle the loot distribution
    itself; it merely adds the roll to the system for processing.
