documentation:
  brief: Caches frequently accessed vendor data to improve performance during item
    transactions.
  description: The CacheFrequentVendorData method prepares and stores essential vendor-related
    information in memory for quick access during player interactions with vendors.
    This includes caching item lists, prices, and availability status to reduce database
    queries and enhance responsiveness when players browse or purchase items. The
    method is typically invoked during vendor initialization or when significant data
    changes occur, ensuring that frequently requested vendor data remains readily
    available without repeated expensive lookups.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vendor Initialization
    code: "void VendorInteraction::InitializeVendor()\n{\n    // Other initialization\
      \ code...\n    CacheFrequentVendorData();\n    // Continue with vendor setup\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after vendor data has been loaded or modified
    to ensure cached values reflect current state. It's designed to minimize database
    overhead by pre-fetching commonly accessed vendor information.
