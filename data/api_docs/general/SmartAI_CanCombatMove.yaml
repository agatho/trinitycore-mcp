  method: CanCombatMove
  signature: bool SmartAI::CanCombatMove() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI unit can perform movement actions during combat.
  description: The CanCombatMove method checks if the SmartAI-controlled creature
    or unit is allowed to move while engaged in combat. This flag typically controls
    whether the AI will attempt to reposition, chase targets, or use mobility-based
    abilities during battle. The check considers various factors such as the unit's
    current state, combat behavior settings, and any restrictions imposed by the AI
    script or game mechanics. This method is commonly used internally by the SmartAI
    system to make decisions about movement during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI unit is permitted to move during combat; returns
    false if movement is restricted or disabled during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Check Combat Movement Permission
    code: "if (smartAI->CanCombatMove()) {\n    // Unit can move during combat\n \
      \   // Proceed with movement-based actions\n}\nelse {\n    // Unit cannot move\
      \ during combat\n    // Use stationary tactics instead\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Movement Logic
    code: "void OnCombatEnter() {\n    if (CanCombatMove()) {\n        // Enable dynamic\
      \ positioning\n        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_MOVE);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Stick to defensive positioning\n        DoCast(SPELL_DEFENSIVE_STANCE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the SmartAI framework and may
    be influenced by various AI configuration parameters, spell effects, or scripted
    conditions. The result can change dynamically based on combat state transitions
    or external modifiers.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's return value in critical movement
    logic, as it may not account for all possible movement restrictions that could
    be imposed by the game engine or custom scripts.
