  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::CacheFrequentlyAccessedData()
documentation:
  brief: Caches frequently accessed objective tracker data for improved performance.
  description: The CacheFrequentlyAccessedData method prepares and stores commonly
    used data from the ObjectiveTracker system in memory to reduce redundant computations
    and database lookups. This method is typically invoked during initialization or
    when the tracker's state changes significantly. It ensures that subsequent accesses
    to tracked objectives, quest progress, or related data can be fulfilled quickly
    without requerying the underlying systems. The caching mechanism helps optimize
    performance for UI elements that frequently update based on objective status.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->CacheFrequentlyAccessedData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any significant change to tracked objectives
    or quest data to ensure cached values remain accurate. It is not thread-safe and
    should only be invoked from the main game thread.
