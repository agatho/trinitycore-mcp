  class: Item
  method: DeleteRefundDataFromDB
  signature: void Item::DeleteRefundDataFromDB(int * trans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes refund data associated with the item from the database.
  description: The DeleteRefundDataFromDB method removes all refund-related information
    for the current item instance from the database. This typically occurs when an
    item is no longer eligible for refund, such as after a successful purchase or
    when the refund window has expired. The method operates on the item's internal
    database record and updates the corresponding entry to clear refund data. It may
    also update related transaction records and ensure consistency in the game's economy
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the transaction ID associated
      with the refund data to be deleted. If null, the method will attempt to use
      the item's internal transaction reference.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (item)\n{\n    int transactionId\
      \ = item->GetRefundTransactionId();\n    item->DeleteRefundDataFromDB(&transactionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Null Transaction Pointer
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->DeleteRefundDataFromDB(nullptr);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when refund data is no longer valid or
    has been processed. It directly modifies database entries and should be used carefully
    in transactional contexts to avoid data inconsistency.
  warnings: Calling this method with an incorrect transaction ID may result in unintended
    data removal from the database. Ensure that the transaction ID provided is valid
    and corresponds to the actual refund record before calling this method.
