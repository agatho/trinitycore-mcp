  signature: void MonkAI::HandleEmergencyHealing()
documentation:
  brief: Performs emergency healing for the monk's target or self when health drops
    below a critical threshold.
  description: The HandleEmergencyHealing method is responsible for triggering emergency
    healing abilities within the MonkAI class. This method evaluates the current health
    status of the monk and its target, determining whether an immediate healing spell
    should be cast to prevent death or reduce incoming damage. It typically activates
    when health falls below a predefined critical percentage, prioritizing life-saving
    abilities such as Effuse, Renewing Mist, or other emergency healing spells based
    on the monk's current spec and combat state. The method does not directly manage
    the casting logic but rather serves as a decision point that determines if emergency
    healing is necessary.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    HandleEmergencyHealing();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    used in conjunction with health checks. It assumes that the monk's target has
    been properly initialized and that the AI has access to valid combat state information.
  warnings: Ensure that emergency healing logic does not interfere with other priority-based
    actions such as damage mitigation or offensive abilities. Improper use may lead
    to inefficient resource allocation during high-intensity encounters.
