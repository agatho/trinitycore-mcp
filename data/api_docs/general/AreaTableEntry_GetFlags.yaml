  class: AreaTableEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int AreaTableEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with an area table entry for determining
    area properties and behaviors.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags of the AreaTableEntry. These flags define various properties and behaviors
    of the area, such as whether it's an instance, dungeon, raid, or has specific
    gameplay mechanics enabled. The returned value can be used in bitwise operations
    to check for specific area characteristics. This method is commonly used in game
    logic to determine how areas should behave in different contexts like player movement,
    quest handling, or combat restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask flags of the area. Each bit corresponds
    to a specific flag that defines area properties such as instance type, PvP zones,
    or special gameplay mechanics. Common flags include values like 1 (instance),
    2 (pvp), 4 (raid), etc., depending on the game's internal flag definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area is an Instance
    code: "AreaTableEntry const* area = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (area\
      \ && (area->GetFlags() & 1) != 0)\n{\n    // This area is an instance\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Area Type Using Multiple Flags
    code: "AreaTableEntry const* area = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(5678);\nif (area)\n\
      {\n    int flags = area->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 2) // PvP area\n     \
      \   printf(\"PvP Zone\\n\");\n    if (flags & 4) // Raid area\n        printf(\"\
      Raid Zone\\n\");\n    if (flags & 8) // Battleground area\n        printf(\"\
      Battleground Zone\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of each bit in the returned flag value is defined within
    the TrinityCore source code and may vary between different versions. Developers
    should consult the AreaTableEntry structure definition or related documentation
    for precise flag meanings. This method performs a simple data retrieval operation
    with no performance impact.
  warnings: Be aware that flag values are not standardized across all World of Warcraft
    expansions and may change between versions. Always validate that your flag checks
    are compatible with the target game version. Using incorrect bit positions in
    bitwise operations can lead to unexpected behavior.
