documentation:
  brief: Updates memory usage metrics for the bot's memory profile.
  description: The UpdateMemoryMetrics method collects and records current memory
    consumption data for a bot's memory profile. This method is typically invoked
    to refresh internal statistics about memory allocation, usage patterns, and resource
    consumption within the bot's operational context. It may be called periodically
    or in response to specific events that affect memory state. The updated metrics
    can be used for performance monitoring, debugging, or optimizing bot behavior
    based on memory constraints.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations or retrieves system memory
    information. It may be called automatically by the bot's core logic or manually
    during debugging sessions.
