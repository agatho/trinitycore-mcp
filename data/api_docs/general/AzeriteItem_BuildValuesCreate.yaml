  class: AzeriteItem
  method: BuildValuesCreate
  signature: void AzeriteItem::BuildValuesCreate(int * data, int flags, const int
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates the provided data array with Azerite item creation values for network
    transmission.
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for constructing the initial
    state data for an Azerite item that will be sent to clients when the item is created
    or spawned in the game world. This method populates a provided integer array with
    the necessary field values that define the Azerite item's properties, such as
    its current level, experience, and other relevant attributes. The method uses
    the specified flags to determine which fields should be included in the data packet
    and writes the resulting values into the target buffer. This is typically used
    during packet construction for object creation updates sent over the network.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the Azerite item creation values
      will be written. The array must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold
      all required field values.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that control which fields are included in the data
      packet. These flags determine the specific attributes and properties that should
      be serialized for the Azerite item's creation state.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a target integer array where the constructed values will
      be copied. This parameter may be used as a reference or base pointer for positioning
      within the data structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesCreate
    code: 'AzeriteItem azeriteItem;

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      azeriteItem.BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BuildValuesCreate with target buffer
    code: 'AzeriteItem azeriteItem;

      int* buffer = new int[200];

      int flags = 0x0F;

      azeriteItem.BuildValuesCreate(buffer, flags, buffer);

      delete[] buffer;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    constructing network packets for Azerite item creation. Developers should ensure
    that the target data array has sufficient capacity to hold all serialized fields.
    The exact field layout and meaning of flags may vary depending on the specific
    version of TrinityCore and the game client being targeted.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the flags parameter can result in incomplete or malformed
    data packets, potentially causing client-side errors or desynchronization issues.
    The target buffer must be properly allocated with sufficient size to avoid memory
    corruption.
