  method: CreateDemonHunterAI
  signature: int ClassAIFactory::CreateDemonHunterAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Demon Hunter AI instance for use in the game
    environment.
  description: The CreateDemonHunterAI method is responsible for instantiating a new
    Demon Hunter AI component within the TrinityCore framework. This function allocates
    memory for the AI structure, sets up default behaviors and attributes specific
    to Demon Hunters, and integrates the AI into the existing game state management
    system. The method typically handles initialization of combat routines, spell
    selection logic, and class-specific abilities. It is commonly invoked when spawning
    a new Demon Hunter NPC or bot within the World of Warcraft environment through
    the TrinityCore server architecture.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer that will receive the identifier of the newly
      created Demon Hunter AI instance. This parameter must point to a valid memory
      location where the function can store the resulting AI identifier.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as insufficient memory, invalid
    parameters, or system resource limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Demon Hunter AI Creation
    code: "int botId;\nint result = factory->CreateDemonHunterAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Demon Hunter AI created with ID: %d\\n\", botId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create Demon Hunter AI, error code: %d\\n\"\
      , result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and relies on proper initialization
    of the game environment. The returned bot identifier should be stored for future
    reference when managing or updating the AI instance. Memory management for the
    AI instance is handled internally by the framework.
  warnings: The parameter 'bot' must not be a null pointer; passing NULL will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crash. Ensure that the ClassAIFactory instance
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
