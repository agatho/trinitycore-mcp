  signature: bool HunterAI::IsInOptimalRange(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's current target is within optimal firing range.
  description: The IsInOptimalRange method evaluates whether the hunter's current
    target is positioned at an optimal distance for attacking with ranged weapons.
    This method considers the hunter's weapon range, the target's position, and any
    relevant game mechanics such as movement speed or positioning. It is commonly
    used in AI decision-making to determine if a shot should be fired or if the hunter
    needs to reposition. The method does not modify any internal state and can be
    called multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target is within optimal range for ranged attacks,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the hunter's current position allows for
    effective ranged combat with the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (hunterAI->IsInOptimalRange()) {\n    // Execute ranged attack\n   \
      \ hunter->CastSpell(target, RANGED_SPELL_ID);\n} else {\n    // Move closer\
      \ to target\n    hunter->MoveTowards(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI state tracking and may consider factors
    such as the hunter's current movement state, target's speed, and weapon range
    properties. It is expected to be called frequently during combat decision loops.
