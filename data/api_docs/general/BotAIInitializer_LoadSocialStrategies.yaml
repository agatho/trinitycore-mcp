  method: LoadSocialStrategies
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::LoadSocialStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads social behavior strategies for bot AI characters within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The LoadSocialStrategies method is responsible for loading predefined
    social interaction behaviors and strategies that govern how bot AI characters
    interact with other players and NPCs in the game world. This method typically
    initializes internal data structures or configuration settings that define the
    social tendencies, communication patterns, and relationship behaviors of bot characters.
    It may load data from configuration files, databases, or hardcoded values to establish
    the baseline social framework for bots. The method is generally called during
    the initialization phase of bot AI systems to ensure that social behaviors are
    properly configured before the bots begin interacting with the game environment.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadSocialStrategies();

      // Social strategies are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the setup phase of bot AI initialization.
    It may involve reading from configuration files or database entries that define
    social behavior parameters. The implementation might be thread-safe depending
    on how it accesses shared resources, but developers should verify concurrent access
    patterns in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure this method is called before any bot AI logic attempts to utilize
    social behaviors. Failure to load strategies properly may result in undefined
    behavior or lack of social interaction for bot characters.
