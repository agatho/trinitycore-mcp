documentation:
  brief: Initializes pet AI behavior when the pet becomes active in the world
  description: The JustAppeared method is called when a pet becomes active in the
    world, typically after being summoned or respawned. This method initializes the
    pet's AI behavior and sets up any necessary state for the pet to function correctly
    within the game environment. It is part of the PetAI class and is invoked during
    the pet's transition from inactive to active state, ensuring proper AI initialization
    before the pet begins executing its behavior routines.

  - title: Basic usage in custom pet AI implementation
    code: "class MyPetAI : public PetAI {\npublic:\n    void JustAppeared() override\
      \ {\n        PetAI::JustAppeared();\n        // Custom initialization logic\
      \ here\n        SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during pet summoning, respawn, or when a
    pet becomes active in the world. It should not be called manually by other systems
    unless implementing custom AI behavior that requires explicit initialization of
    pet state.
