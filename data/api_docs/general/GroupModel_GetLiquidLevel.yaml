  class: GroupModel
  method: GetLiquidLevel
  signature: bool GroupModel::GetLiquidLevel(const int & pos, float & liqHeight) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the liquid height at a specified position within the group model.
  description: The GetLiquidLevel method attempts to determine the height of the liquid
    surface at a given position within the GroupModel. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's terrain and water system to accurately place objects,
    handle collision detection with liquids, or determine if a point is submerged.
    The method takes a reference to an integer position identifier and outputs the
    corresponding liquid height through a float reference parameter. It returns true
    if the liquid level was successfully retrieved, or false if no liquid data exists
    for the specified position.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the position identifier
      within the group model. This typically corresponds to a specific coordinate
      or index in the terrain grid.
  - name: liqHeight
    description: A reference to a float that will be populated with the liquid height
      value if the method succeeds. This represents the Z-coordinate of the water
      surface at the specified position.
  returns: Returns true if the liquid level data was successfully retrieved for the
    given position; otherwise, returns false if no liquid information is available
    or the position is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int position = 12345;\nfloat liquidHeight;\nif (groupModel.GetLiquidLevel(position,\
      \ liquidHeight)) {\n    std::cout << \"Liquid height at position \" << position\
      \ << \" is \" << liquidHeight << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No\
      \ liquid data available for position \" << position << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with terrain or map loading
    systems where accurate liquid height information is required for gameplay mechanics
    such as swimming, water-based object placement, or underwater effects. The 'pos'
    parameter should correspond to a valid index within the GroupModel's internal
    structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this method corresponds
    to an actual location within the GroupModel to avoid undefined behavior. Calling
    this method with invalid positions may lead to incorrect results or crashes.
