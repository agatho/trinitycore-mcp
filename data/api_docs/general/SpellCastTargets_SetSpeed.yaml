  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetSpeed(float speed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the speed value for the spell cast targets.
  description: The SetSpeed method configures the movement speed modifier that will
    be applied to the spell's casting or projectile behavior. This is commonly used
    in spell effects that involve movement, such as teleportation spells, channeled
    abilities, or projectiles with custom speeds. The speed parameter typically represents
    a multiplier where values greater than 1 increase speed and values less than 1
    decrease it. This method directly modifies internal state within the SpellCastTargets
    object and affects how the spell behaves during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Faster Projectile Speed
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetSpeed(2.0f); // Double the speed of the spell''s projectile'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reducing Spell Movement Speed
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetSpeed(0.5f); // Half the normal speed for a slow-moving spell effect'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating the spell cast to ensure the
    speed is properly applied. The speed value is usually interpreted as a multiplier
    rather than an absolute speed, so values like 1.0 represent normal speed.
  warnings: Setting extremely high or low speed values may cause unexpected behavior
    in spell animations or collision detection. Ensure that speed modifiers are within
    reasonable bounds for gameplay balance.
