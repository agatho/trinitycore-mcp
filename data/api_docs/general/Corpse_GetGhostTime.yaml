documentation:
  brief: Returns the time when the corpse became a ghost state
  description: The GetGhostTime method retrieves the timestamp at which the corpse
    entered its ghost state. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, corpses
    remain in a 'ghost' state for a limited period before despawning. This method
    returns the Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the player's corpse transitioned
    into this ghost state, allowing scripts and systems to determine how long the
    ghost has existed. The returned value is typically used by the game engine to
    manage corpse expiration and cleanup routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the Unix timestamp (seconds
    since epoch) when the corpse became a ghost. This value can be compared against
    current time to determine remaining ghost duration or for logging/debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Check how long a corpse has been in ghost state
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    int ghostTime\
      \ = corpse->GetGhostTime();\n    int currentTime = time(nullptr);\n    int ghostDuration\
      \ = currentTime - ghostTime;\n    // ghostDuration now contains seconds since\
      \ corpse became ghost\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned timestamp is in Unix time format (seconds since January 1, 1970).
    This method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the value.
    The ghost state typically lasts for a configurable amount of time defined by server
    settings.
