documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of a character by their name from
    the cache.
  description: The GetCharacterGuidByName method searches for a character in the internal
    cache using their in-game name and returns the corresponding unique identifier
    (GUID). This method is typically used to quickly access character data without
    performing expensive database lookups. The method assumes that the character name
    is valid and exists in the cache, as it does not perform any validation or fallback
    mechanisms. It's commonly used in systems that require fast character identification
    based on names, such as chat systems, guild management, or player interaction
    handlers. The returned GUID can then be used to retrieve full character data or
    perform operations on the specific player.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The in-game name of the character to search for. Must be a valid,
      non-empty string that matches an existing character in the cache.
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the character if found in the cache.
    Returns 0 if no character with the specified name exists in the cache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int guid = CharacterCache::GetCharacterGuidByName(\"Shadowmoon\");\nif\
      \ (guid != 0) {\n    // Character found, use guid for further operations\n \
      \   printf(\"Found character with GUID: %d\\n\", guid);\n} else {\n    // Character\
      \ not found in cache\n    printf(\"Character 'Shadowmoon' not found.\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Player Operations
    code: "std::string playerName = \"Azerothian\";\nint playerGuid = CharacterCache::GetCharacterGuidByName(playerName);\n\
      if (playerGuid != 0) {\n    // Use the GUID to get player data or perform actions\n\
      \    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ playerGuid));\n    if (player) {\n        player->SendNotification(\"Hello\
      \ from cache lookup!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached data only and may not reflect real-time database
    changes. The cache must be properly populated before calling this method. Performance
    is optimized for frequent lookups, but the method will be slower if the character
    name is not found in the cache.
  warnings: The method returns 0 for both non-existent characters and potential GUID
    collisions with zero values. This can lead to ambiguity in error handling. Always
    verify that the returned GUID is valid before using it for operations.
