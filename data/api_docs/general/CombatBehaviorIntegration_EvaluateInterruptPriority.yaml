documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the urgency level of interrupting the current target
    based on combat behavior logic.
  description: The EvaluateInterruptPriority method determines how urgently a unit
    should interrupt its current action or spell when a new threat or opportunity
    arises. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes to prioritize
    actions such as spell interruption, ability usage, or movement adjustments during
    combat. It considers factors like the target's threat level, spell casting status,
    and potential damage output. The result is an ActionUrgency enum value that indicates
    whether the interrupt should be immediate, high priority, medium priority, or
    low priority. This method assumes the unit has a valid target and is in combat
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionUrgency enum value indicating the priority level for interrupting
    the current target. Possible values include IMMEDIATE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or NONE
    depending on the evaluation criteria such as threat level, spell casting status,
    and potential damage output.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "ActionUrgency urgency = combatBehavior->EvaluateInterruptPriority(target);\n\
      if (urgency >= ActionUrgency::HIGH) {\n    // Interrupt current spell or action\n\
      \    unit->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority to Decide Interrupt Strategy
    code: "ActionUrgency priority = combatBehavior->EvaluateInterruptPriority(target);\n\
      switch (priority) {\n    case ActionUrgency::IMMEDIATE:\n        // Immediately\
      \ interrupt and switch to defensive stance\n        unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEFENSIVE_STANCE);\n        break;\n    case ActionUrgency::HIGH:\n\
      \        // Prepare for interrupt but continue current action\n        unit->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // No immediate interrupt needed\n  \
      \      break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat behavior system and should only be
    called when the unit is actively engaged in combat. The evaluation logic may vary
    depending on the specific AI implementation and class type. Performance is generally
    good as it's designed for real-time decision making, but complex evaluations could
    impact frame rate in high-density combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer can cause crashes. The method
    assumes the unit is in a combat state; calling it outside of combat may produce
    undefined behavior or incorrect results.
