documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BattlePetManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BattlePetManager
    class, providing global access to the single instance of this manager. This method
    ensures that only one BattlePetManager object exists throughout the application
    lifecycle, centralizing battle pet related functionality and state management.
    The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage
    the lifetime of the object, as it is managed internally by the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of BattlePetManager. The method never
    returns NULL in a properly initialized TrinityCore environment, as the singleton
    is guaranteed to be created during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing BattlePetManager Singleton
    code: 'BattlePetManager* petManager = BattlePetManager::instance();

      // Use petManager to access battle pet functionality

      uint32 petCount = petManager->GetActivePetCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using the standard singleton
    pattern with lazy initialization. The BattlePetManager instance is created during
    server startup and remains valid for the entire runtime of the TrinityCore server
    process.
