documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination for the specified group ID
  description: The UpdateGroupCoordination method synchronizes group member positions
    and states within the player bot system. This method ensures that all group members
    are aware of each other's current locations and status, which is essential for
    coordinated bot behavior in group scenarios such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.
    The method typically triggers internal updates to group member data structures
    and may broadcast position information to maintain synchronization across the
    group.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group to update coordination for. This
      value should correspond to a valid group in the player bot system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      groupMgr->UpdateGroupCoordination(groupId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the player bot AI system when
    group membership changes or when position updates occur. It may involve network
    communication to synchronize data across multiple bots in a group.
