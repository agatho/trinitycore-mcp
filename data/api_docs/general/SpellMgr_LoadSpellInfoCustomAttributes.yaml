  method: LoadSpellInfoCustomAttributes
  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellInfoCustomAttributes()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads custom attributes for all spells within the SpellMgr
    system.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoCustomAttributes method is responsible for loading
    and initializing custom spell attributes from the database into the SpellMgr's
    internal data structures. This method ensures that each spell in the game has
    its associated custom properties, such as cooldowns, mana costs, or special flags,
    properly configured before the server begins processing spell-related actions.
    It typically runs during server startup or database reload operations to synchronize
    the in-memory spell information with the persistent spell attribute definitions
    stored in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::OnServerInit()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoCustomAttributes();\n\
      \    // Spell attributes are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or after
    a database reload. Repeated calls may result in duplicate data loading or memory
    leaks if not handled properly. The method relies on the database being properly
    connected and containing valid spell attribute records.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within high-frequency game loops as it may
    block execution while reading from the database. Ensure that all required database
    tables are populated with correct spell attribute data before invoking this method
    to prevent runtime errors or incorrect spell behavior.
