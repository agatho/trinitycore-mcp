  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateSpecialRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateSpecialRequirements(const Quest * quest,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all special requirements for a given quest.
  description: The ValidateSpecialRequirements method checks if a player has met any
    special conditions or prerequisites required to accept and progress through a
    specific quest. These special requirements may include faction standing, item
    possession, quest completion status, or other game-specific conditions that are
    not covered by standard quest flags or objectives. The method returns true if
    all special requirements are satisfied, otherwise false. This validation is typically
    used during quest acceptance, update checks, or when evaluating whether a player
    can interact with quest-related NPCs or objects.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the special requirements
      to be validated against the player.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose special
      requirements are being checked against the quest.
  returns: Returns true if all special requirements defined in the quest are met by
    the player, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the player
    does not satisfy one or more conditions required for the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Requirement Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateSpecialRequirements(quest, player)) {\n  \
      \  // Player meets all special requirements\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not meet requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateSpecialRequirements(quest,\
      \ this)) {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REAGENTS);\n      \
      \  return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n    AddQuest(quest);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against player data such as faction reputation,
    inventory items, completed quests, and other character-specific attributes. It
    is part of a larger validation system that ensures quest integrity in the game
    world. The method may be called frequently during quest interactions, so performance
    optimization is important.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and player parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid null pointer exceptions. Incorrect handling of special
    requirements can lead to quests being inaccessible or available when they shouldn't
    be.
