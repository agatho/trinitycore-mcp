    code: "if (player->IsImmuneToEnvironmentalDamage()) {\n    // Player is immune\
      \ to environmental damage\n    // Do something special\n}\nelse {\n    // Player\
      \ is not immune to environmental damage\n    // Handle normal damage\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player state checks
    and may be affected by buffs, debuffs, or game effects that modify player immunity.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other immunity checks such as
    immunity to magic or physical damage. It specifically relates to environmental
    damage types only.
