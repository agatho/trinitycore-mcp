  class: Guild
  method: GetMembersCount
  signature: uint32 Guild::GetMembersCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of members currently in the guild.
  description: The GetMembersCount method retrieves the current count of all players
    who are members of the guild. This value includes all ranks and roles within the
    guild, from regular members to officers and the guild master. The returned count
    is updated dynamically as players join or leave the guild, making it useful for
    real-time guild management operations such as displaying guild size, checking
    if a guild has reached its maximum member limit, or determining whether certain
    guild activities can proceed based on membership thresholds. This method does
    not distinguish between online and offline members; it counts all members regardless
    of their connection status.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of members currently in the
    guild. Returns zero if the guild has no members or if the guild object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Display Guild Size
    code: "void DisplayGuildSize(Guild* guild)\n{\n    uint32 memberCount = guild->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Guild has \" << memberCount << \" members.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Guild Capacity
    code: "bool IsGuildAtCapacity(Guild* guild)\n{\n    uint32 currentMembers = guild->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    uint32 maxMembers = 100; // Example maximum\n    return currentMembers\
      \ >= maxMembers;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup and should have minimal performance
    impact. It is safe to call from any thread, though in most cases it will be called
    from the game world thread or player interaction context.
  warnings: The returned count may change between calls if players join or leave the
    guild during execution of your code. If you need a consistent value for multiple
    operations, consider caching the result locally.
