  method: operator=
  signature: LfgPlayerData & LfgPlayerData::operator=(LfgPlayerData && right)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LfgPlayerData object to this instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all data members from the right-hand
    side LfgPlayerData object to this object, leaving the source object in a valid
    but unspecified state. This operation is typically used for efficient resource
    management when swapping or reassigning LfgPlayerData instances. The method adheres
    to standard C++ move semantics and is part of the TrinityCore's LFG (Looking for
    Group) system which manages player group finding data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to this LfgPlayerData object, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LfgPlayerData player1;

      LfgPlayerData player2;

      player1 = std::move(player2); // Moves player2''s data to player1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<LfgPlayerData> players;

      LfgPlayerData newPlayer;

      players.push_back(std::move(newPlayer)); // Efficiently moves newPlayer into
      vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented using move semantics, which means it should be
    more efficient than copy assignment when dealing with large objects. The source
    object after the operation will be in a valid but unspecified state and should
    not be used until reassigned.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object may lead to undefined
    behavior if the object's destructor or other methods are called afterward without
    reinitialization.
