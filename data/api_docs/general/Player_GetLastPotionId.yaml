  class: Player
  method: GetLastPotionId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetLastPotionId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the ID of the last potion used by the player.
  description: The GetLastPotionId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) of
    the last potion that was used by the player. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with the player's inventory or spell system to track potion usage
    and ensure proper cooldown handling. The returned ID corresponds to the specific
    potion item that was last consumed, which can be useful for determining whether
    a potion is still on cooldown or for tracking player behavior related to consumable
    items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 ID of the last potion used by the player. This ID represents
    the unique identifier of the potion item that was last consumed, and will be zero
    if no potion has been used recently or if the player's potion usage tracking is
    not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 lastPotionId = player->GetLastPotionId();\nif (lastPotionId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // A potion was used recently\n    std::cout << \"Last potion ID: \"\
      \ << lastPotionId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other potion-related methods
    such as GetLastPotionId() and may be affected by cooldowns. The implementation
    relies on tracking the last potion used, which can be influenced by various game
    mechanics including spell casting, item usage, and player behavior.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not always reflect
    actual potion usage due to potential synchronization issues or game state changes.
    Also, if the player has not used any potions recently, the returned ID might be
    zero, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about potion usage.
