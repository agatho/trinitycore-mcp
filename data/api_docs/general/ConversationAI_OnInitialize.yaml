documentation:
  brief: Initializes the conversation AI system and prepares it for handling player
    interactions.
  description: The OnInitialize method is called during the initialization phase of
    a ConversationAI object, setting up internal state and preparing the AI for processing
    conversation events. This method typically configures necessary data structures,
    registers event handlers, and ensures that all required resources are available
    before the AI begins responding to player inputs. It's part of the standard AI
    lifecycle in TrinityCore's conversation system and is invoked automatically when
    a conversation is created or loaded. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations, serving instead as a setup hook for
    the AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ConversationAI* conversation = new ConversationAI();

      conversation->OnInitialize();

      // AI is now ready to handle player interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a ConversationAI
    instance. It's typically invoked by the core engine when a conversation is initialized,
    not manually by developers unless implementing custom AI logic.
