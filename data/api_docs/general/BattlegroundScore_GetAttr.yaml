documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific attribute value from the battleground score object by
    index.
  description: The GetAttr method retrieves an integer attribute value from a BattlegroundScore
    object using a zero-based index. This method is typically used to access various
    statistics or metrics associated with a player's performance in a battleground,
    such as damage dealt, healing done, or honorable kills. The method assumes that
    the underlying data structure maintains a collection of attributes in a predefined
    order, and the index parameter specifies which attribute to retrieve. It is commonly
    used during battleground result processing and scoring calculations within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the attribute at the specified index.
    If the index is out of bounds or the attribute is not initialized, the method
    may return 0 or a default value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Damage Dealt Attribute
    code: "BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();\nint damageDealt\
      \ = score->GetAttr(0);\n// Assuming index 0 corresponds to total damage dealt\n\
      if (damageDealt > 0)\n{\n    // Process the damage value\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player dealt %d damage in battleground.\", damageDealt);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through All Attributes
    code: "BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();\nfor (int i\
      \ = 0; i < MAX_BATTLEGROUND_SCORE_ATTRIBUTES; ++i)\n{\n    int attrValue = score->GetAttr(i);\n\
      \    if (attrValue != 0)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Attribute %d: %d\"\
      , i, attrValue);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground scoring system and assumes that attributes
    are stored in a fixed-size array or similar structure. The exact meaning of each
    index should be determined by examining the implementation or documentation of
    the specific battleground type. Performance is generally O(1) for direct access,
    but bounds checking may add minimal overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the index parameter does not exceed the maximum number of
    attributes defined for the battleground score structure. Accessing invalid indices
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect data retrieval. This method should
    only be called on valid BattlegroundScore objects that have been properly initialized.
