documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes threat levels between bot group members to maintain consistent
    aggro distribution.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupThreat method ensures that all bots within a group
    maintain synchronized threat levels with respect to their current target. This
    is crucial for proper group dynamics in World of Warcraft, particularly when using
    TrinityCore's bot system. The method typically updates each bot's threat table
    based on the group's overall threat state, preventing individual bots from gaining
    excessive aggro or losing it unnecessarily. It helps maintain balanced combat
    behavior and prevents situations where one bot might pull all the attention while
    others remain idle. This synchronization is especially important in encounters
    where multiple bots are engaged with the same target.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Update
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    if\
      \ (m_botThreatManager)\n        m_botThreatManager->SynchronizeGroupThreat();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during bot combat updates to maintain
    proper threat synchronization. The implementation likely involves iterating through
    all group members and adjusting their threat values based on the group's current
    target state. Performance impact is generally low as it only affects bots in active
    combat situations.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or when no group members are present
    may result in unnecessary processing. Ensure that group membership is properly
    validated before calling to avoid potential null pointer exceptions or invalid
    threat calculations.
