documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit that created a demon
  description: This method retrieves the Unit object that originally created or summoned
    a demon. It is commonly used in the context of creature AI and summoning mechanics,
    particularly for demons that are summoned by NPCs. The method returns a pointer
    to the creator unit, which may be null if no creator exists or if the demon was
    not summoned by an NPC. This functionality is essential for understanding the
    relationship between summoned creatures and their creators, especially in scenarios
    involving demon summoning and control.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit that created the demon. If no creator exists
    or the demon was not summoned by an NPC, this may return nullptr. The returned
    pointer is valid for the duration of the demon's existence and can be used to
    access the creator's properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Demon Creator Retrieval
    code: "Unit* creator = unit->GetDemonCreator();\nif (creator)\n{\n    // Demon\
      \ was summoned by a Unit\n    // Do something with creator\n}\nelse\n{\n   \
      \ // No creator exists or demon wasn't summoned by an NPC\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with summoning mechanics and
    AI behavior. The returned pointer may be null if the demon was not summoned by
    a Unit, or if the creator has been destroyed or removed from memory. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple pointer retrieval operation.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as the returned pointer may
    be invalid if the creator unit has been destroyed or removed from memory. Always
    check for null before using the returned pointer to avoid access violations.
