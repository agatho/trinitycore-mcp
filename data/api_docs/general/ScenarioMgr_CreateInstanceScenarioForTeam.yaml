  class: ScenarioMgr
  method: CreateInstanceScenarioForTeam
  signature: InstanceScenario * ScenarioMgr::CreateInstanceScenarioForTeam(InstanceMap
    * map, int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new instance scenario for the specified team within
    the given map.
  description: The CreateInstanceScenarioForTeam method is responsible for generating
    a new InstanceScenario object associated with a specific team and map. This function
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's scenario system, where
    different teams (such as Alliance or Horde) may have distinct scenario experiences
    within the same instance map. The method ensures that each team gets its own unique
    scenario instance, allowing for differentiated gameplay mechanics, objectives,
    and rewards based on faction or group composition. It is commonly invoked during
    the initialization phase of a scenario-based dungeon or raid encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the InstanceMap object representing the map where the
      scenario will be created. This parameter must not be null and should refer to
      an existing instance map.
  - name: team
    description: Integer identifier representing the team for which the scenario is
      being created. Valid values are typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, though
      custom team IDs may also be supported depending on implementation.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the newly created InstanceScenario object if successful;
    otherwise returns nullptr if the creation fails due to invalid parameters or internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "InstanceMap* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(1234, 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    InstanceScenario*\
      \ scenario = sScenarioMgr->CreateInstanceScenarioForTeam(map, 0);\n    if (scenario)\n\
      \    {\n        // Scenario successfully created\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "InstanceMap* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(1234, 0);\nif (!map)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      scenario\", \"Failed to find instance map for scenario creation.\");\n    return;\n\
      }\n\nInstanceScenario* scenario = sScenarioMgr->CreateInstanceScenarioForTeam(map,\
      \ 1);\nif (!scenario)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"scenario\", \"Failed to create\
      \ scenario for team %u.\", 1);\n    return;\n}\n\n// Proceed with initializing\
      \ the scenario\nscenario->Initialize();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided map is already initialized and valid.
    The returned InstanceScenario object must be managed carefully to prevent memory
    leaks. It's recommended to check for null returns before using the pointer in
    further operations.
  warnings: Do not call this function with a null map pointer or invalid team ID,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the map is properly
    loaded and accessible before attempting to create a scenario instance.
