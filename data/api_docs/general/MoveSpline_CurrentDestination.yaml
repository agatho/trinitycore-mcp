  class: MoveSpline
  method: CurrentDestination
  signature: const Vector3 & MoveSpline::CurrentDestination() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current destination vector of the spline movement.
  description: The CurrentDestination method retrieves the target position that the
    MoveSpline object is currently moving towards. This method is commonly used in
    TrinityCore's movement system to determine where a unit (such as a player or creature)
    is headed during spline-based pathfinding or movement animations. The returned
    Vector3 represents the absolute world coordinates of the destination point, and
    it may change as the spline progresses through its waypoints or when new destinations
    are assigned. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call
    during active movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Vector3 structure representing the current destination
    coordinates in world space. The vector contains X, Y, and Z components that define
    the target location of the spline movement.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Current Destination for Debugging
    code: 'const Vector3& dest = unit->GetMoveSpline()->CurrentDestination();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Unit is moving to: X=%f, Y=%f, Z=%f", dest.x, dest.y,
      dest.z);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Unit Has Reached Destination
    code: "const Vector3& currentDest = unit->GetMoveSpline()->CurrentDestination();\n\
      const Vector3& unitPos = unit->GetPosition();\nfloat distance = unitPos.GetDistance(currentDest);\n\
      if (distance < 0.5f)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\", \"Unit has reached destination\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal Vector3 member, so modifications
    to the returned value will affect the spline's destination. The method is typically
    used in conjunction with other MoveSpline methods like SetDestination() or Update()
    to monitor movement progress. Performance-wise, this is a fast operation as it
    only returns a stored reference without complex calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned Vector3 directly, as it will alter
    the spline's destination. Always ensure that any changes made to the destination
    are valid world coordinates and within expected movement constraints. The returned
    reference becomes invalid if the spline is reset or destroyed.
