  class: BotAI
  method: GetAIState
  signature: BotAIState BotAI::GetAIState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current AI state of the bot.
  description: The GetAIState method returns the current operational state of the
    BotAI instance. This state indicates what mode or condition the bot's AI is currently
    in, such as idle, combat, moving, or following. The returned BotAIState enum value
    can be used to determine how the bot should behave or respond to various game
    events. This method provides a way for external systems or other parts of the
    AI logic to query the current state without directly accessing internal variables.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIState enum value representing the current AI state of the bot. Possible
    values may include states like IDLE, COMBAT, MOVING, FOLLOWING, etc., depending
    on the implementation and context of the bot's behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current AI State
    code: "BotAIState state = bot->GetAIState();\nif (state == BotAIState::COMBAT)\n\
      {\n    // Handle combat-specific logic\n    bot->AttackTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging or state-based decision making
    within the AI system. It's important to note that the returned value may change
    frequently depending on the bot's actions and environment. The method itself is
    read-only and does not modify any internal state.
