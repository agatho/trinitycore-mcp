  method: CommitUpdate
  signature: void ZoneCache::CommitUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Commits pending updates to the zone cache, ensuring all changes are applied
    and synchronized.
  description: The CommitUpdate method finalizes any pending modifications made to
    the ZoneCache object. It ensures that all queued updates are processed and written
    to the underlying data structures. This method is typically called at the end
    of a batch update operation or when the cache state needs to be made consistent
    with the current game world state. The method does not return any value, as it
    operates directly on the internal state of the ZoneCache instance. Precondition
    for calling this method is that there must be pending updates in the cache that
    require committing.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ZoneCache cache;

      // ... perform some updates on the cache ...

      cache.CommitUpdate(); // Apply all pending changes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after making multiple modifications to avoid
    performance penalties from frequent individual updates. It's typically used in
    scenarios where batch operations are performed on zone data.
