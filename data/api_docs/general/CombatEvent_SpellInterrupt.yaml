  class: CombatEvent
  method: SpellInterrupt
  signature: CombatEvent CombatEvent::SpellInterrupt(int interrupter, int victim,
    uint32 interruptedSpell, uint32 interruptSpell)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new CombatEvent object representing a spell interruption.
  description: The SpellInterrupt method generates a CombatEvent instance that signifies
    when one spell is interrupted by another. This event typically occurs when a character's
    casting is disrupted by incoming damage, movement, or other interruptible actions.
    The method takes the identifiers of the interrupting entity and victim, along
    with the spell IDs of both the interrupted and interrupting spells. It constructs
    and returns a properly initialized CombatEvent object that can be used for logging,
    processing, or triggering combat-related mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: interrupter
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that is interrupting the
      spell cast. This could be a player, NPC, or any game object capable of interrupting
      spells.
  - name: victim
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity whose spell casting is
      being interrupted.
  - name: interruptedSpell
    description: The Spell ID of the spell that was interrupted. This identifies which
      specific spell was stopped in its casting process.
  - name: interruptSpell
    description: The Spell ID of the spell that caused the interruption. This identifies
      what spell or effect led to the interruption.
  returns: A CombatEvent object representing the spell interruption event, initialized
    with the provided parameters and appropriate metadata for combat processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption Event Creation
    code: 'CombatEvent ev = CombatEvent::SpellInterrupt(playerGuid, targetGuid, 12345,
      67890);

      // Creates a combat event where player interrupts target''s spell with another
      spell'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell Interruption in Combat Handler
    code: "void HandleCombatInterrupt(uint64 interrupterGuid, uint64 victimGuid, uint32\
      \ interruptedSpellId) {\n    uint32 interruptSpellId = 54321; // Example interrupting\
      \ spell\n    CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellInterrupt(interrupterGuid,\
      \ victimGuid, interruptedSpellId, interruptSpellId);\n    // Process the combat\
      \ event for logging or effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat systems where spell casting can be
    disrupted by external factors. The returned CombatEvent object should be processed
    through the appropriate combat handling system to ensure proper game state updates
    and logging.
  warnings: Ensure that all GUIDs passed are valid and correspond to existing entities
    in the current world context, otherwise the event may not process correctly or
    could cause undefined behavior.
