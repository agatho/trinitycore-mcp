documentation:
  brief: Releases all allocated actions and clears the action pool
  description: The Cleanup method releases all resources held by actions within the
    ActionPool, ensuring proper deallocation of memory and cleanup of any associated
    game objects or data structures. This method is typically called when the action
    pool is no longer needed, such as during shutdown sequences or when cleaning up
    temporary action pools. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and that all actions
    are properly terminated before the pool itself is destroyed. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return value operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'ActionPool* pool = new ActionPool();

      // ... populate the action pool with actions ...

      pool->Cleanup();

      delete pool;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before deleting an ActionPool instance to ensure
    all resources are properly released. It is important to avoid calling Cleanup
    on a pool that is still in use by active game systems, as this may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
