  class: Creature
  method: CalculateDamageForSparring
  signature: uint32 Creature::CalculateDamageForSparring(int * attacker, uint32 damage)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates damage for sparring between creature and attacker.
  description: This method computes the damage dealt by a creature during sparring
    combat, taking into account various factors such as attacker's strength, weapon
    damage, and creature's level. It is used primarily in PvP scenarios or when creatures
    engage in combat with players or other creatures. The method returns the calculated
    damage value which can be used for further processing like applying damage to
    target or determining outcome of combat.
  parameters:
  - name: attacker
    description: Pointer to the attacker's data structure, typically containing information
      about the attacker's stats and attributes. This parameter is essential for calculating
      damage based on attacker's strength and weapon damage.
  - name: damage
    description: The base damage value that is passed in for calculation. This represents
      the initial damage amount before adjustments are made based on attacker's characteristics.
  returns: Represents the calculated damage value after applying all relevant modifiers
    and calculations. The returned value may vary depending on the attacker's strength,
    weapon type, and creature's level, and can be used for further combat processing
    or display purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 damage = creature->CalculateDamageForSparring(&attacker, base_damage);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including weapon speed,
    attacker's strength, and creature's level. Performance considerations include
    potential overhead from calculating multiple parameters for each call. Thread
    safety is not an issue as this method is typically called within single-threaded
    contexts during combat processing.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in PvP scenarios as incorrect
    damage calculations can lead to imbalances in combat outcomes. Ensure that attacker
    data is properly initialized before calling this method.
