documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DangerZone instance with default settings and prepares
    it for use in the game world.
  description: The DangerZone constructor initializes a new instance of the DangerZone
    class, setting up internal state variables and preparing the object for integration
    into the game world's danger zone system. This method is typically called when
    creating a new danger zone entry, such as during map loading or dynamic zone creation.
    The constructor ensures that all required fields are properly initialized with
    default values, and it may register the zone with relevant subsystems like AI
    behavior managers or player detection systems. It does not perform any complex
    operations or external calls directly; instead, it focuses on establishing a valid
    object state ready for further configuration or activation.

  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of DangerZone
    code: 'DangerZone* zone = new DangerZone();

      // The zone is now initialized and ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or network calls.
    It only initializes internal member variables to their default states. Developers
    should ensure that additional configuration methods are called after instantiation
    if specific behavior is required.
