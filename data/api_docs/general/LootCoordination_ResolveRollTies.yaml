  signature: void LootCoordination::ResolveRollTies(Group * group, uint32 rollId)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves ties in loot rolling by determining the final winner among tied
    players.
  description: The ResolveRollTies method handles the scenario where multiple players
    in a group have rolled the same highest value for an item during a loot roll.
    It ensures that only one player receives the item by applying tie-breaking rules,
    typically based on player order or other internal criteria. This method is invoked
    after all rolls are completed and ties are detected within the group's loot coordination
    system. The method operates on a specified group and roll ID to manage the resolution
    process.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who participated in
      the loot roll. Must be a valid group with active members.
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific loot roll being resolved. Used
      to track and manage the correct set of tied rolls within the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot resolution
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 rollId = 12345;

      lootCoord.ResolveRollTies(group, rollId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot system when ties are
    detected during a group loot roll. It assumes that all players in the group have
    already rolled and that ties exist for a specific item. The implementation may
    vary depending on the game's loot rules (e.g., random selection, first-to-roll
    wins, etc.).
  warnings: Ensure that the provided group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Also, verify that the rollId corresponds
    to an actual ongoing or recently completed roll.
