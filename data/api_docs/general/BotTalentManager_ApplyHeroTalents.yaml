  class: BotTalentManager
  method: ApplyHeroTalents
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::ApplyHeroTalents(Player * bot, uint8 specId, uint32
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Applies hero talents to a specified bot player for the given specialization
    and level.
  description: The ApplyHeroTalents method is responsible for assigning hero talents
    to a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This function typically handles
    the logic required to grant appropriate talent points based on the specified specialization
    ID and character level. It ensures that the bot's talent tree is properly updated
    according to game mechanics, including any restrictions or requirements tied to
    the talent system. The method may also validate whether the operation is allowed
    given the current state of the player and the specified parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to which hero talents
      will be applied.
  - name: specId
    description: Identifier for the talent specialization (0 for first spec, 1 for
      second spec, etc.).
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the bot player; used to determine how many talent
      points are available.
  returns: Returns true if the hero talents were successfully applied to the bot,
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Apply Hero Talents to a Bot
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized\nbool success = BotTalentManager::ApplyHeroTalents(myBot,\
      \ 0, 60);\nif (success)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Hero talents applied\
      \ successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal talent point tracking and may
    require the bot to be in a valid state for talent changes. It's recommended that
    this function is called after verifying that the player has sufficient level and
    available talent points.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the bot's state or parameters
    might lead to inconsistent talent trees or unexpected behavior in the game logic.
