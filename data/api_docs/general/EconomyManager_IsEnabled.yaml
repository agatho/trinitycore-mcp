  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool EconomyManager::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the economy system is enabled in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the economy system, which governs
    in-game currency transactions, item sales, and other financial mechanics, is currently
    active on the server. This check is essential for modules or systems that rely
    on economy functionality to ensure they only operate when the economy is properly
    initialized and functional. The method performs a simple boolean check against
    an internal flag that indicates the global economy state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the economy system is enabled, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether financial operations such as buying/selling items, currency exchanges,
    or auction house functionality are available for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Economy Check
    code: "if (EconomyManager::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with economy-related\
      \ operations\n    Player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_GOLD_COIN, 10);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Economy is disabled, handle accordingly\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Economy system\
      \ is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Auction House Access
    code: "void Player::HandleAuctionHouseQuery() {\n    if (EconomyManager::IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        // Open auction house interface\n        SendAuctionHouseWindow();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Disable auction functionality\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Auction House is not available at this time.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during initialization or runtime checks to
    prevent invalid operations when the economy system has been disabled via configuration
    or admin command. It's a lightweight check that reads from an internal boolean
    state variable and does not involve database queries or complex logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that all economy-related functions will behave correctly
    if this method returns false. Always implement fallback behavior or disable dependent
    systems when the economy is disabled to avoid unexpected errors or data corruption.
