documentation:
  brief: Sets the plateau threshold for learning analytics to determine when training
    has reached a stable performance level.
  description: The SetPlateauThreshold method configures the number of episodes used
    to evaluate whether a learning model has plateaued in its performance. This is
    commonly used in reinforcement learning scenarios within the TrinityCore framework
    to monitor training stability and decide when further training is no longer beneficial.
    The threshold determines how many recent episodes are considered when calculating
    performance trends. A higher threshold provides more stable but potentially slower
    detection of plateaus, while a lower threshold may trigger false positives. This
    method does not return any value and directly modifies internal state used by
    the learning analytics system.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LearningAnalytics* analytics = new LearningAnalytics();

      analytics->SetPlateauThreshold(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Threshold for Stable Detection
    code: "LearningAnalytics* analytics = sWorld->GetLearningAnalytics();\nif (analytics)\n\
      {\n    analytics->SetPlateauThreshold(500);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that affects how learning analytics tracks
    performance trends. It should be called before starting training sessions to ensure
    proper plateau detection behavior. The threshold value should be chosen based
    on the expected convergence rate of the specific learning model being used.
  warnings: Setting an extremely low threshold may cause frequent false positives
    for plateau detection, leading to premature termination of training. Conversely,
    setting a very high threshold might delay plateau detection, potentially wasting
    computational resources.
