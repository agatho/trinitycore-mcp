documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can be cast while moving.
  description: This method checks if a specific spell can be cast while the unit is
    in motion. It evaluates the spell's properties and movement restrictions to determine
    if casting is allowed during movement. The method is commonly used in spell validation
    logic to ensure proper gameplay mechanics are maintained during player movement.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining game balance and preventing exploits
    related to spell casting during movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can be cast while moving, false otherwise. The
    return value depends on the spell's properties and movement restrictions defined
    in the SpellInfo structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->CanCastSpellWhileMoving(spellInfo)) {\n    // Allow spell casting\
      \ during movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking spell properties such as movement
    restrictions and whether the spell allows casting while moving. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method involves simple property checks. Thread safety is ensured
    through proper locking mechanisms in the underlying system.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a spell can be cast
    during movement without considering all relevant spell properties. Incorrect usage
    may lead to gameplay imbalances or exploit opportunities.
