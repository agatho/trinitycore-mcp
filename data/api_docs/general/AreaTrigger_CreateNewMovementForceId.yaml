  class: AreaTrigger
  method: CreateNewMovementForceId
  signature: int AreaTrigger::CreateNewMovementForceId(int * map, uint32 areaTriggerId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new movement force ID for an area trigger, returning a unique identifier
    for tracking movement forces.
  description: The CreateNewMovementForceId method generates and returns a unique
    identifier for a movement force associated with an area trigger. This ID is used
    internally by the TrinityCore server to track and manage movement-related effects
    that are triggered by area triggers. The method takes a pointer to a map and an
    area trigger ID as parameters, and it returns an integer representing the newly
    created movement force ID. This functionality is essential for implementing dynamic
    movement mechanics in World of Warcraft such as pulling enemies, moving objects,
    or creating force fields within specific areas.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to a map object where the area trigger is located. This parameter
      determines the context and scope of the movement force being created.
  - name: areaTriggerId
    description: Unique identifier for the area trigger that will be associated with
      this movement force. Must correspond to an existing area trigger in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the newly created movement force ID. A
    positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative or zero value may
    indicate failure or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CreateNewMovementForceId
    code: "int forceId = areaTrigger->CreateNewMovementForceId(&map, 12345);\nif (forceId\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Movement force created successfully\n    printf(\"Created movement\
      \ force ID: %d\\n\", forceId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create movement force\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with area trigger event handling
    and movement force management systems. The returned ID should be stored for future
    reference when applying or modifying the movement force behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the map parameter points to a valid map object and that the
    areaTriggerId corresponds to an existing area trigger; otherwise, the method may
    return invalid results or cause undefined behavior.
