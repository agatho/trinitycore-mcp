documentation:
  brief: Applies available poisons to the rogue's weapons based on current inventory
    and combat state
  description: The ApplyPoisons method is responsible for managing the application
    of poison effects to a rogue character's melee weapons. This method evaluates
    the rogue's current inventory for applicable poisons, checks weapon compatibility,
    and applies the most effective available poison to the main and off-hand weapons.
    The method typically executes during AI decision-making cycles and ensures that
    the rogue maintains optimal poisoning status for combat effectiveness. It considers
    factors such as poison availability, weapon type, and combat readiness to determine
    which poisons to apply.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    ApplyPoisons();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the rogue's AI update cycle and
    should only be invoked when the rogue is in a combat-ready state. The implementation
    may vary based on the specific rogue class specialization (e.g., Subtlety, Assassination,
    Combat). It assumes that poison items are already in the rogue's inventory and
    properly equipped.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat contexts may result
    in unexpected behavior or failed poison applications. Ensure that the rogue has
    sufficient poison items available before invoking this method to avoid potential
    errors or performance issues.
