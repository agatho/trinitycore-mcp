  brief: Removes completed quest turn-in data from the player's quest log
  description: The CleanupCompletedTurnIns method is responsible for cleaning up and
    removing all completed quest turn-in records from a player's active quest log.
    This method ensures that finished quests are properly marked as completed and
    their associated data is cleared to prevent duplication or conflicts in subsequent
    quest interactions. The cleanup process typically occurs after a player has successfully
    turned in all required quest items and completed the necessary objectives for
    a given quest. This method helps maintain the integrity of the quest system by
    ensuring that completed quests do not interfere with ongoing quest progression.

  - title: Basic Quest Cleanup Usage
    code: "void Player::HandleQuestComplete()\n{\n    // ... quest completion logic\
      \ ...\n    m_questTurnIn.CleanupCompletedTurnIns();\n    // ... continue with\
      \ reward distribution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    a player successfully completes a quest. It's important to note that this cleanup
    operation does not remove the quest from the player's completed quests list, but
    rather cleans up temporary data structures used during the turn-in process. The
    method may also trigger additional cleanup operations for related quest objectives
    or dependencies.
  warnings: Developers should ensure that all quest completion logic is properly executed
    before calling this method, as it permanently removes turn-in data and cannot
    be undone. Calling this method prematurely may result in loss of quest progress
    information and potential quest system inconsistencies.
