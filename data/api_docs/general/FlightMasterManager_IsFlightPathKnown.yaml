  method: IsFlightPathKnown
  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::IsFlightPathKnown(uint32 nodeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player knows a specific flight path node.
  description: The IsFlightPathKnown method determines if a player has learned or
    discovered a particular flight path node within the FlightMasterManager. This
    is used primarily in World of Warcraft's flight path system to control which nodes
    are visible and usable by players. The method typically checks against the player's
    known flight paths database, ensuring that only accessible nodes can be selected
    for travel. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the flight
    master interface and preventing invalid or unauthorized flight path selections.
  parameters:
  - name: nodeId
    description: The unique identifier of the flight path node to check. This corresponds
      to the NodeID field in the dbc flight paths database entries.
  returns: Returns true if the player knows the specified flight path node, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the node is available for selection
    in the flight master interface and can be used for travel.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Knows a Flight Path Node
    code: "if (flightMasterManager.IsFlightPathKnown(12345)) {\n    // Node 12345\
      \ is known, allow player to use it\n    player->AddToFlightPath(12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Node 12345 is not known, inform player or handle accordingly\n \
      \   player->SendSystemMessage(\"You do not know this flight path.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Flight Path Validation
    code: "void ValidateFlightPath(uint32 startNode, uint32 endNode) {\n    if (!flightMasterManager.IsFlightPathKnown(startNode))\
      \ {\n        // Handle invalid starting node\n        return;\n    }\n    if\
      \ (!flightMasterManager.IsFlightPathKnown(endNode)) {\n        // Handle invalid\
      \ ending node\n        return;\n    }\n    // Both nodes are known, proceed\
      \ with flight path validation\n    // ... flight path logic here ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal player data structures that
    track known flight paths. It may involve database lookups or in-memory caches
    depending on the TrinityCore version and implementation details. The method should
    be called before attempting to use a flight path node to avoid errors or unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method without verifying that the FlightMasterManager
    instance is properly initialized for the player context. Incorrect nodeId values
    may lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies if not handled properly.
