documentation:
  brief: Summons a tyrant demon to assist the player in combat.
  description: The SummonTyrant method is responsible for creating and deploying a
    tyrant demon, which serves as a powerful summoned creature for the Demonology
    warlock class. This method typically handles the logic for spawning the demon,
    setting its initial attributes, and integrating it into the player's current combat
    scenario. The summoned tyrant will engage enemies and provide damage output or
    support based on the warlock's abilities and talents. This method is generally
    invoked when the player activates their Demonology specialization's tyrant summoning
    ability, such as through a spell or talent that triggers demon summoning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker = player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker();

      tracker->SummonTyrant();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's pet system and may require
    the player to have sufficient resources (such as soul shards) to summon the tyrant.
    The summoned demon is typically bound to the player's current target or area of
    effect.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has a valid DemonologyDemonTracker instance before
    calling this method, otherwise it may result in a crash or undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called during appropriate combat states where summoning
    is allowed.
