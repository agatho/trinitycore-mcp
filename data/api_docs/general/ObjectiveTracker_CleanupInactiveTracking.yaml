  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::CleanupInactiveTracking()
documentation:
  brief: Removes inactive objective tracking entries from the tracker.
  description: The CleanupInactiveTracking method iterates through all active objective
    tracking entries and removes those that are no longer valid or relevant. This
    typically occurs when objectives have been completed, abandoned, or are no longer
    applicable to the player's current state. The method ensures that the objective
    tracker remains clean and efficient by eliminating stale data that could otherwise
    clutter the UI or consume unnecessary resources. It is commonly invoked during
    periodic cleanup routines or when transitioning between different game states.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->CleanupInactiveTracking();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game engine during regular
    update cycles. Developers should not need to invoke it manually unless implementing
    custom tracking logic or debugging purposes. The cleanup process may involve checking
    objective completion status, player quest state, and other contextual factors.
