  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: SetCombatConfig
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::SetCombatConfig(const CombatAIConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the combat behavior settings for the enhanced bot AI instance.
  description: The SetCombatConfig method allows developers to define and apply specific
    combat-related parameters to an EnhancedBotAI instance. This method takes a CombatAIConfig
    object that encapsulates various tactical behaviors, such as targeting preferences,
    spell usage patterns, and engagement strategies. The configuration is applied
    immediately to the bot's current combat state, affecting how it interacts with
    enemies during battle. This functionality is essential for customizing bot behavior
    in automated testing scenarios or for creating specialized AI-driven NPC companions.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A constant reference to a CombatAIConfig object containing the desired
      combat behavior settings. This includes parameters like targeting priority,
      spell casting rules, and engagement distance thresholds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Setup
    code: 'CombatAIConfig config;

      config.targetingPriority = TARGETING_PRIORITY_NEAREST;

      config.spellCastChance = 0.75f;

      config.engagementDistance = 30.0f;

      botAI.SetCombatConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Tactical Configuration
    code: 'CombatAIConfig advancedConfig;

      advancedConfig.targetingPriority = TARGETING_PRIORITY_HIGHEST_DAMAGE;

      advancedConfig.spellCastChance = 0.9f;

      advancedConfig.engagementDistance = 25.0f;

      advancedConfig.useDefensiveSpells = true;

      advancedConfig.minHealthPercent = 0.3f;

      botAI.SetCombatConfig(advancedConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the EnhancedBotAI instance
    and should be called before initiating combat to ensure proper configuration.
    The configuration is applied instantly without requiring a restart or reinitialization
    of the AI system.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat may cause unexpected behavior
    in the bot's current engagement. Ensure that all configuration parameters are
    valid and within acceptable ranges to prevent undefined behavior.
