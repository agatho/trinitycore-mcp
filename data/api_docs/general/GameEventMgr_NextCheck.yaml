  class: GameEventMgr
  method: NextCheck
  signature: uint32 GameEventMgr::NextCheck(uint16 entry) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the time until the next game event check for the specified event
    entry.
  description: The NextCheck method determines when the next scheduled check will
    occur for a given game event. This is used internally by the GameEventMgr to manage
    event timing and ensure events are properly triggered or updated at the correct
    intervals. The returned value represents a time offset in seconds from the current
    moment, indicating how long to wait before performing the next check. This method
    is essential for maintaining proper event synchronization within the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of seconds until the next
    scheduled check for the specified game event. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    that no further checks are needed or that the event is currently active and requires
    immediate processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 eventId = 42;\nuint32 nextCheckTime = sGameEventMgr->NextCheck(eventId);\n\
      if (nextCheckTime > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule next event check after nextCheckTime\
      \ seconds\n    sWorld->ScheduleEvent([eventId]() {\n        sGameEventMgr->UpdateServerTime();\n\
      \        sGameEventMgr->CheckEventConditions(eventId);\n    }, nextCheckTime\
      \ * IN_MILLISECONDS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the GameEventMgr to determine
    when to next process a specific game event. The implementation likely caches timing
    information for performance reasons and may return different values based on event
    state (active, inactive, pending). Developers should be aware that this method
    does not modify any event state but only calculates the next check time.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid game event entries; passing
    invalid entry IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect timing calculations.
    The returned value is relative to the current server time and should be converted
    appropriately for scheduling purposes.
