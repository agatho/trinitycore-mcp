  class: Garrison
  method: ActivateBuilding
  signature: void Garrison::ActivateBuilding(uint32 garrPlotInstanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a building in the garrison using the specified plot instance ID.
  description: The ActivateBuilding method is used to activate a building within a
    player's garrison. It takes a garrPlotInstanceId parameter which identifies the
    specific plot where the building resides. This method typically triggers the building
    to become functional, allowing players to interact with it for various garrison
    activities such as training, crafting, or resource production. The activation
    process usually involves updating the building's state in the database and notifying
    the client about the change. Precondition for this method is that the specified
    plot instance must exist and contain a valid building that can be activated.
  parameters:
  - name: garrPlotInstanceId
    description: The unique identifier of the garrison plot instance where the building
      to be activated is located. This ID corresponds to a specific plot within the
      player's garrison layout.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a Building in Player's Garrison
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ plotId = 12345; // Example plot instance ID\n    garrison->ActivateBuilding(plotId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database updates to mark the building as active
    and may trigger additional events or callbacks. It should only be called when
    the player has appropriate permissions and the plot instance exists.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid garrPlotInstanceId may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the plot ID corresponds to a valid, existing plot
    within the garrison before invoking this method.
