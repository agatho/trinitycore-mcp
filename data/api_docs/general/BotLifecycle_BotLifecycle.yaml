  class: BotLifecycle
  method: BotLifecycle
  signature: void BotLifecycle::BotLifecycle(int botGuid, std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bot lifecycle with the specified GUID and session.
  description: The BotLifecycle constructor initializes a new bot lifecycle instance
    for a given bot GUID and associated session. This method sets up the necessary
    internal state for managing the bot's behavior, including establishing communication
    channels, initializing session data, and preparing the bot for execution within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method is typically called when a new bot is created
    or loaded into the game world, ensuring that all required resources are properly
    allocated and configured for the bot to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character. This value must
      be a valid, non-zero GUID that uniquely identifies the bot within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object associated with this bot
      lifecycle. The session contains all runtime data and configuration for the bot's
      operations, including player state, behavior settings, and communication handles.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Lifecycle Initialization
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(botGuid);

      BotLifecycle lifecycle(botGuid, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Bot Lifecycle with Existing Session
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 54321;\nstd::shared_ptr<BotSession> existingSession =\
      \ GetBotSession(botGuid);\nif (existingSession) {\n    BotLifecycle lifecycle(botGuid,\
      \ existingSession);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the bot management system.
    Developers should not directly instantiate BotLifecycle objects unless implementing
    custom bot creation logic. The method assumes that the provided session is properly
    initialized and valid.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or zero GUID may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure
    that the session parameter is not null before calling this constructor, as it
    will cause a runtime error if not properly validated.
