  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckSubgroupChanges
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckSubgroupChanges(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Checks for changes in subgroup assignments within a player group and updates
    the group state accordingly.
  description: The CheckSubgroupChanges method is responsible for monitoring and updating
    the internal state of a player group when subgroup compositions change. It evaluates
    whether players have been moved between subgroups, disbanded from the group, or
    if new members have joined. This method ensures that the AI bot's understanding
    of the group structure remains accurate, which is crucial for proper tactical
    decision-making and coordination during raids or dungeons. The method takes a
    pointer to the Group object and a reference to a GroupState structure that holds
    the current state information. It performs necessary updates to maintain synchronization
    between the game's internal group data and the AI's representation of it.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group being monitored.
      This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid group instance.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState structure that holds the current state
      information of the group. The method modifies this structure to reflect any
      subgroup changes detected during execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    Group* group = GetPlayer()->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckSubgroupChanges(group,\
      \ m_groupState);\n        // Continue with bot logic using updated group state\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group event handling
    code: "void PlayerbotGroupScript::OnGroupChanged(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group\
      \ && group->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        GroupState state = GetGroupState(group);\n\
      \        CheckSubgroupChanges(group, state);\n        UpdateBotBehavior(state);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group update cycles in the AI system.
    It assumes that the Group object passed to it is valid and properly initialized.
    The method does not perform any direct modifications to the game world state,
    but rather updates internal AI representations of group structure. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls on large groups where subgroup
    changes are rare.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to this method as it will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the GroupState object is properly initialized
    before calling this method. The method may be called during critical game events,
    so ensure thread safety if used outside of the main game thread context.
