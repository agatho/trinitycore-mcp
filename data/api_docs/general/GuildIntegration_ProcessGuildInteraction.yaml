  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ProcessGuildInteraction
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ProcessGuildInteraction(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes guild-related interactions for a given player, handling all associated
    guild mechanics and updates.
  description: The ProcessGuildInteraction method is responsible for managing all
    guild-related activities and state changes for a specified player. This includes
    updating guild member information, processing guild invitations, handling guild
    chat messages, and synchronizing guild data with the game server. The method ensures
    that player guild memberships are properly maintained and that all guild-specific
    actions are executed correctly within the TrinityCore framework. It typically
    acts as a central hub for guild-related operations, coordinating between various
    subsystems such as guild management, member tracking, and communication systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's guild interactions should be
      processed. The value must be a valid player GUID or NULL to indicate no player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Interaction Processing
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ProcessGuildInteraction(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Guild Interactions for Multiple Players
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\n\
      for (int id : playerIds) {\n    guildInt.ProcessGuildInteraction(&id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game loop updates or when specific
    guild events occur. It may perform database operations to persist guild state
    changes and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of code.
    The method assumes that the player GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an
    existing player in the game world.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or NULL player pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the player GUID points to a valid, logged-in player before
    calling this method. This function should not be called from multiple threads
    simultaneously without proper synchronization.
