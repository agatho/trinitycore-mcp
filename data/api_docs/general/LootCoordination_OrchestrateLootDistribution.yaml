  class: LootCoordination
  method: OrchestrateLootDistribution
  signature: void LootCoordination::OrchestrateLootDistribution(Group * group, const
    int & items)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the loot distribution process for a group, coordinating item assignment
    according to group loot rules.
  description: The OrchestrateLootDistribution method is responsible for managing
    the distribution of loot among group members in a World of Warcraft instance using
    TrinityCore's framework. This method ensures that items are properly allocated
    based on group loot settings such as round-robin, free-for-all, or master loot.
    It coordinates with the group's loot master and handles the assignment of items
    to players according to the established loot rules. The method is typically invoked
    when a lootable item is acquired by a group member, triggering the distribution
    mechanism. This function plays a critical role in maintaining fair and consistent
    loot allocation across all group-based content in the game.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which loot
      distribution is being orchestrated. Must be a valid group with at least one
      member.
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of items to be
      distributed within the group's loot pool. This parameter determines how many
      items will be processed during the distribution cycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Distribution Initiation
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int lootItems = 3;

      lootCoordination->OrchestrateLootDistribution(playerGroup, lootItems);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Distributing Loot After Monster Kill
    code: "if (playerGroup && playerGroup->isLootMaster(player))\n{\n    int itemQuantity\
      \ = group->GetLoot()->GetItemCount();\n    lootCoordination->OrchestrateLootDistribution(playerGroup,\
      \ itemQuantity);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been properly initialized
    with valid members and that the loot system is active. The method does not directly
    handle item removal from the loot pool; it coordinates the assignment process.
    It should only be called when there are items ready for distribution within the
    group's loot context.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group pointer or with an invalid items
    count may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is in a
    valid state and that loot has been properly initialized before invoking this function.
