  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::ExecuteHitAndRun(const KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a hit-and-run kiting strategy based on the provided kiting context.
  description: The ExecuteHitAndRun method implements a kiting behavior where the
    AI character performs a quick attack followed by a retreat to maintain distance
    from enemies. This strategy is commonly used in World of Warcraft combat scenarios
    to avoid taking damage while dealing damage. The method evaluates the current
    kiting context, including target position, player health, and available abilities,
    to determine the optimal hit-and-run sequence. It returns a KitingResult indicating
    success or failure of the kiting maneuver.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingResult enum value indicating the outcome of the kiting execution.
    Possible values may include KITING_SUCCESS, KITING_FAILED, KITING_INTERRUPTED,
    or other status codes specific to the kiting system's implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteHitAndRun
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// Populate context with target and player data\n\
      KitingResult result = kitingManager.ExecuteHitAndRun(context);\nif (result ==\
      \ KITING_SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful kiting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI combat decision-making cycles.
    The effectiveness of the hit-and-run strategy depends heavily on accurate positioning
    and timing calculations within the kiting context.
