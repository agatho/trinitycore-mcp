  method: GetEnemiesInRange
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetEnemiesInRange(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of enemy units within a specified range of the combat specialization
    base.
  description: The GetEnemiesInRange method determines how many hostile units are
    located within a given radius around the CombatSpecializationBase. This functionality
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to assess threat levels or determine
    optimal targeting strategies. The method performs a spatial query using the internal
    positioning system of the base and its associated world objects, returning a count
    of all enemies found within the specified range. It does not consider line-of-sight
    or other environmental factors beyond simple distance calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of enemy units found
    within the defined range. A return value of zero indicates no enemies were detected
    in the vicinity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = combatSpecBase->GetEnemiesInRange(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with attack logic\n    printf(\"Detected %u enemies\
      \ within range\\n\", enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Range Check
    code: "float detectionRange = 25.0f;\nuint32 nearbyEnemies = combatSpecBase->GetEnemiesInRange(detectionRange);\n\
      switch (nearbyEnemies)\n{\n    case 0:\n        // No enemies, safe to move\n\
      \        break;\n    case 1:\n        // Single target, consider focusing fire\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Multiple enemies, evaluate AoE strategy\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the base's current position and the positions of all
    active enemy units in the same map instance. It performs a linear scan of nearby
    units, which may have performance implications in high-density combat scenarios
    with many units. The range parameter is interpreted as a Euclidean distance in
    world coordinates.
  warnings: The method does not account for obstacles or terrain that might block
    line-of-sight between the base and enemies. Additionally, it only considers units
    that are currently within the same map instance; cross-map detection is not supported.
