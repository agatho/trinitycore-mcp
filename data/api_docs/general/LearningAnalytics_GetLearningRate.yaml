  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetLearningRate
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetLearningRate(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the learning rate of a specified bot within the LearningAnalytics
    system.
  description: The GetLearningRate method returns a floating-point value representing
    the rate at which a specific bot learns or adapts within the TrinityCore environment.
    This value is typically used to quantify how quickly a bot acquires new skills,
    knowledge, or behaviors based on its interactions and training. The method takes
    a unique identifier (GUID) for the bot as input and calculates or retrieves its
    corresponding learning rate from internal data structures. It's commonly employed
    in AI-driven systems where bot performance and adaptability are monitored and
    optimized.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: A unique 32-bit identifier (GUID) that uniquely identifies the bot
      whose learning rate is to be retrieved. This value must correspond to an existing
      bot within the system, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  returns: A float value representing the learning rate of the specified bot. The
    exact interpretation depends on the internal implementation but typically ranges
    from 0.0 (no learning) to 1.0 (maximum learning capacity). Returns 0.0 if the
    bot GUID is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float rate = analytics.GetLearningRate(12345);\nif (rate > 0.0f)\n{\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Bot learning rate: \" << rate << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botId = 54321;\nfloat learningRate = analytics.GetLearningRate(botId);\n\
      if (learningRate <= 0.0f)\n{\n    // Handle invalid or unknown bot case\n  \
      \  LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Failed to retrieve learning rate for bot GUID: {}\"\
      , botId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Bot {} has a learning rate\
      \ of {}\", botId, learningRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LearningAnalytics system has been properly initialized
    and that the specified bot GUID exists in the active dataset. The returned value
    may be cached or computed dynamically depending on the internal design of the
    system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. Always validate the input GUID
    before invoking this method if possible.
