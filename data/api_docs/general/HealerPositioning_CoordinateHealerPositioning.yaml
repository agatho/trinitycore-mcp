  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CoordinateHealerPositioning
  signature: void HealerPositioning::CoordinateHealerPositioning(const int & healers,
    Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates healer positioning within a group based on specified number of
    healers.
  description: The CoordinateHealerPositioning method manages the strategic placement
    of healers in a group context, likely for optimal raid or dungeon performance.
    It takes the total number of healers and a pointer to the group object to determine
    appropriate positioning strategies. This method is crucial for maintaining effective
    healing coverage during encounters where healer positioning significantly impacts
    survival rates. The implementation may involve calculating positions relative
    to the group's center, considering player roles, and ensuring healers are distributed
    to cover all party members effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: healers
    description: An integer reference specifying the number of healers in the group.
      This value determines how many healer positions need to be coordinated and may
      influence positioning logic.
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to a Group object representing the current player group.
      This parameter provides access to group members and their positions, which are
      essential for determining optimal healer placement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic healer positioning coordination
    code: 'Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int numHealers = 3;

      healerPositioning.CoordinateHealerPositioning(numHealers, raidGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic healer coordination during encounter
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    int healerCount = player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    healerPositioning.CoordinateHealerPositioning(healerCount, player->GetGroup());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with group management systems and may require
    the group to be in a valid state before execution. It's designed for use in raid
    environments where healer positioning directly affects encounter success. The
    method might utilize internal pathfinding or spatial algorithms to determine optimal
    positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as it will likely cause undefined behavior if passed an invalid group
    reference. The method may assume certain group configurations and could behave
    unexpectedly in non-standard group setups.
