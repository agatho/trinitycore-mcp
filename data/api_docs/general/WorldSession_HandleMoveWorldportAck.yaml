  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleMoveWorldportAck
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleMoveWorldportAck()
documentation:
  brief: Processes a worldport acknowledgment message from the client after a teleportation
    request.
  description: The HandleMoveWorldportAck method is invoked when the client confirms
    receipt of a worldport (teleport) operation. This function typically validates
    that the player's teleportation was successful and updates internal session state
    accordingly. It serves as a handshake mechanism between the client and server
    to ensure proper handling of teleportation events, particularly in scenarios involving
    cross-zone or cross-map movement. The method may also perform cleanup operations
    related to pending teleportations or update player position tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveWorldportAck()\n{\n    // Process acknowledgment\
      \ of worldport\n    if (GetPlayer() && GetPlayer()->IsInWorld())\n    {\n  \
      \      // Confirm teleportation completion\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO,\
      \ \"Player %s completed worldport\", GetPlayer()->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore network
    handler when a client sends a worldport acknowledgment packet. Developers should
    not call this method directly unless implementing custom teleportation logic.
    The method assumes that the player object exists and is valid.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to players becoming stuck in
    teleportation states or experiencing incorrect position updates. Ensure all related
    session state is properly synchronized before and after calling this function.
