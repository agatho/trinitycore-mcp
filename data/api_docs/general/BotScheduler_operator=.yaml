  class: BotScheduler
  method: operator=
  signature: BotScheduler & BotScheduler::operator=(const BotScheduler & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotScheduler object to another, performing a
    deep copy of all managed data.
  description: The assignment operator for the BotScheduler class performs a deep
    copy of all internal state from the source BotScheduler object to the target object.
    This includes copying any scheduled tasks, bot references, and configuration settings.
    The method ensures that after assignment, both objects are independent copies
    with identical state. This is particularly important in TrinityCore's AI system
    where multiple scheduler instances may manage different sets of bots or tasks.
    The operation returns a reference to the assigned object to allow for chaining
    assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotScheduler object whose contents will be copied to this
      instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotScheduler object after assignment has been
    completed, enabling operator chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler1;

      BotScheduler scheduler2 = scheduler1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      scheduler2 = scheduler1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Example
    code: 'BotScheduler sched1, sched2, sched3;

      // ... initialize sched1 and sched2 ...

      sched3 = sched2 = sched1; // Chained assignment

      // Both sched2 and sched3 now contain copies of sched1''s state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    data structures like task queues, bot lists, or configuration maps are properly
    duplicated. In TrinityCore's context, this is crucial for maintaining proper AI
    behavior when copying scheduler configurations between different bot management
    systems.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large scheduler objects as the deep copy operation
    may have performance implications. Also ensure that any pointers or references
    within the scheduler's internal data structures are properly handled during the
    copy process to avoid dangling references.
