  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & ResourceEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics of the resource event bus.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that holds performance and usage metrics for the ResourceEventBus.
    This includes information such as the number of events processed, average processing
    time, and other relevant operational data. The returned statistics are updated
    in real-time as events are handled by the bus. This method is typically used for
    monitoring and debugging purposes to understand how the resource event system
    is performing within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing current metrics
    about the ResourceEventBus operations, including event counts, processing times,
    and other performance indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const auto& stats = resourceEventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Events processed: " << stats.eventsProcessed << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Resource Bus Performance
    code: "auto stats = resourceEventBus.GetStatistics();\nif (stats.averageProcessingTime\
      \ > 100) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Resource event bus processing time exceeded\
      \ threshold\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    The statistics are updated atomically, ensuring thread-safe access in multi-threaded
    environments. This method does not perform any expensive operations and returns
    immediately with a cached view of the current metrics.
  warnings: While the returned reference is const, developers should be aware that
    accessing statistics during high-frequency event processing may introduce slight
    performance overhead due to internal locking mechanisms. Avoid calling this method
    excessively in time-critical code paths.
