documentation:
  brief: Appends announcement data to a channel notification packet for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The Append method is used to populate a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with announcement-related data. This method is typically invoked when broadcasting
    channel announcements, such as server messages or system notifications, to players
    in a specific channel. It ensures that the appropriate data fields are set within
    the notification packet before it is sent to clients. The method operates on a
    const object and modifies the provided packet in-place without returning any value.
    This functionality is integral to the TrinityCore's channel messaging system and
    supports real-time communication between server and client.

    code: 'AnnouncementsOffAppend announcement;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      announcement.Append(notifyPacket);

      // The notifyPacket now contains the appended announcement data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the provided packet object directly and does not return
    a value. It is designed to be called within the context of channel messaging systems
    where announcements need to be broadcasted to players in a specific channel. The
    method assumes that the packet object has been properly initialized before being
    passed to it.
