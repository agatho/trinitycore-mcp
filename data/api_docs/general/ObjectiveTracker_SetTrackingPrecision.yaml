  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: SetTrackingPrecision
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::SetTrackingPrecision(uint32 botGuid, float precision)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the tracking precision for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The SetTrackingPrecision method configures the precision level used
    by the ObjectiveTracker for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This setting
    affects how accurately the tracker evaluates and reports objective progress, particularly
    in scenarios involving AI-driven quest or objective management. The precision
    value determines the granularity of tracking, with higher values indicating more
    precise tracking behavior. This method is typically used within AI systems to
    fine-tune how bots interpret and respond to objective states.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which tracking precision
      is being set. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: precision
    description: A floating-point value representing the desired tracking precision.
      Higher values indicate more precise tracking behavior, while lower values may
      result in coarser tracking granularity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      tracker.SetTrackingPrecision(12345u, 0.9f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Precision for AI Bot
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->SetTrackingPrecision(botGuid, 0.99f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal tracking state for a specific bot and should
    be called carefully to avoid unintended side effects in AI behavior. The precision
    value is interpreted as a relative measure and may be clamped or normalized internally
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the precision value may lead to unexpected tracking
    behavior, especially if values are outside expected ranges. Ensure that botGuid
    corresponds to an active bot entity before calling this method.
