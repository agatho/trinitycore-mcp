    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the disable gravity aura effect on a target.
  description: The HandleAuraDisableGravity method manages the application and removal
    of the disable gravity aura effect, which prevents a unit from being affected
    by gravitational forces. This is commonly used in game mechanics such as flight
    effects, levitation spells, or other abilities that allow units to float or move
    without being pulled down. The method is invoked through the aura application
    system and modifies the target's movement behavior based on the 'apply' parameter.
    It interacts with the unit's movement flags and physics simulation to achieve
    the desired effect.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state, caster,
      and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of the aura application, typically indicating whether this
      is an initial application or a periodic tick. Values are usually defined in
      the AuraApplication class or related enums.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the gravity disable effect. When true, the target will be affected by the gravity
      disabling aura; when false, normal gravity is restored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Disable Gravity Aura
    code: "void ApplyDisableGravityAura(Unit* target) {\n    if (target) {\n     \
      \   AuraApplication* aurApp = new AuraApplication(target, target, SpellInfo);\n\
      \        HandleAuraDisableGravity(aurApp, 0, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Disable Gravity Aura
    code: "void RemoveDisableGravityAura(Unit* target) {\n    if (target) {\n    \
      \    AuraApplication* aurApp = new AuraApplication(target, target, SpellInfo);\n\
      \        HandleAuraDisableGravity(aurApp, 0, false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the unit's movement flags internally to disable gravity
    effects. It is part of the aura handling system and should only be called from
    within the context of an aura application or removal process. The method does
    not directly manipulate physics but rather adjusts how the game engine treats
    the unit's movement in relation to gravity.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper aura application context,
    as it may lead to inconsistent state or undefined behavior. Ensure that the target
    unit is valid and properly initialized before applying or removing the effect.
