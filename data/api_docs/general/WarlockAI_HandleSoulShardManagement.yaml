  brief: Manages soul shard resources for warlock AI behavior
  description: The HandleSoulShardManagement method is responsible for overseeing
    the allocation, usage, and optimization of soul shards within the WarlockAI system.
    This method ensures that the warlock's AI correctly manages its soul shard inventory,
    determining when to consume shards for spells, when to accumulate them, and how
    to prioritize their use based on current combat situation and spell requirements.
    The method integrates with the broader AI decision-making framework to maintain
    optimal resource utilization for warlock abilities such as Soul Fire, Shadow Bolt,
    and other shard-dependent spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleSoulShardManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked directly from spell casting logic. The implementation assumes that
    the warlock's soul shard count is accessible through standard AI interfaces and
    that the AI has proper access to spell information for decision making.
  warnings: Improper handling of soul shards can lead to inefficient spell usage or
    resource depletion. This method should only be called when the AI is in a valid
    state where resource management decisions are appropriate, such as during active
    combat or when evaluating spell readiness.
