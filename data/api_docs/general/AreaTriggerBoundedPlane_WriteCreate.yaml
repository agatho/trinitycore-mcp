  class: AreaTriggerBoundedPlane
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerBoundedPlane::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for an area trigger bounded plane to a byte buffer for
    client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an AreaTriggerBoundedPlane
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is then sent to a specific player's client to
    inform them of the area trigger's creation. This method is typically used during
    network synchronization when a player enters the range of an area trigger or when
    the server needs to notify the client about a new or updated bounded plane area
    trigger. The serialized data includes relevant trigger parameters such as position,
    dimensions, and orientation, ensuring that the client accurately represents the
    visual and functional aspects of the area trigger in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer to which the creation data for the area trigger is
      written. This buffer will contain serialized data representing the bounded plane's
      properties.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this bounded plane.
      This parameter provides context about which area trigger this plane belongs
      to and its associated properties.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the creation data.
      This allows for player-specific adjustments or filtering of the data sent to
      each client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in area trigger initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AreaTriggerBoundedPlane boundedPlane;

      Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get a valid area trigger reference

      boundedPlane.WriteCreate(data, trigger, player);

      // Send ''data'' to the player''s client for synchronization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network synchronization system.
    It must be called with valid pointers to both the owner AreaTrigger and receiver
    Player objects. The ByteBuffer passed in should not be pre-populated as this method
    will overwrite its contents.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided 'owner' and 'receiver' parameters are valid and
    not null before calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also,
    be cautious about thread safety when accessing the data buffer from multiple threads.
