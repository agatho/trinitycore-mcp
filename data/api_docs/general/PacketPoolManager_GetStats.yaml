  method: GetStats
  signature: int PacketPoolManager::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the packet pool manager's current
    state and usage.
  description: The GetStats method provides detailed statistics regarding the packet
    pool manager's internal state, including memory usage, allocated packets, and
    overall performance metrics. This method is typically used for debugging, monitoring,
    or performance analysis purposes within the TrinityCore server environment. It
    returns an integer value representing the current status or count of pooled packets,
    which can be interpreted based on the implementation details of the packet pool
    manager. The returned value may indicate how many packets are currently in use,
    available, or total allocated depending on the specific design of the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing statistical data about the packet pool manager.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on the implementation but typically indicates
    either a count of active/pooled packets or a status code related to pool management
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int stats = packetPoolManager.GetStats();

      printf("Packet pool statistics: %d\n", stats);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's a read-only operation that retrieves
    current state information. It should not modify any internal data structures and
    is generally safe to call from multiple threads concurrently.
