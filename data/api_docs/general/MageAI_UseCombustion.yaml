documentation:
  brief: Activates the Combustion spell for the Mage AI, triggering its damage-over-time
    effect and associated mechanics.
  description: The UseCombustion method is responsible for activating the Combustion
    spell within the Mage AI system. This method typically manages the activation
    of the Combustion buff, which applies a damage-over-time effect to the target.
    It may also handle cooldown management, resource consumption, and interaction
    with other Mage abilities. The method is part of the general AI behavior for Mages
    and is usually invoked during combat when optimal conditions are met for using
    this powerful spell. This method does not take any parameters and returns no value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Activate Combustion when entering\
      \ combat\n    UseCombustion();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely interacts with internal Mage AI state tracking and may
    require the Mage to be in a valid combat state. It is expected that this method
    will only function if the spell is off cooldown and the necessary resources (mana,
    etc.) are available.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of appropriate combat or AI contexts
    as it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure proper preconditions such
    as valid target and spell availability before invoking.
