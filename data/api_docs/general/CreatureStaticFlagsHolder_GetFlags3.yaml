  class: CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
  method: GetFlags3
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags3() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the third set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags3 method returns the third group of static flags stored
    within the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder class. These flags are typically used to
    define specific behavioral or visual properties of creatures in the World of Warcraft
    environment. The returned integer value represents a bitmask containing multiple
    flag bits that control various aspects of creature functionality, such as movement
    patterns, AI behavior, or interaction states. This method is commonly used during
    creature initialization and runtime to determine how a creature should behave
    based on its configured static flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the third set of static flags. Each bit in
    this integer corresponds to a specific flag that defines certain properties or
    behaviors of the creature. The exact meaning of individual bits depends on the
    game's internal flag definitions and is typically used by the core engine to control
    creature behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\n// Assume flagsHolder has been\
      \ initialized with creature data\nint flags3 = flagsHolder.GetFlags3();\nif\
      \ (flags3 & CREATURE_FLAG3_NO_PVP)\n{\n    // Handle creature that cannot participate\
      \ in PvP\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specific Flag
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder* creatureFlags = GetCreature()->GetCreatureStaticFlagsHolder();\n\
      if (creatureFlags && (creatureFlags->GetFlags3() & 0x100))\n{\n    // Creature\
      \ has the specific flag set\n    // Perform special behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple getter operation and does not modify any internal
    state. The returned flags value should be interpreted using bitwise operations
    to check individual flag states. Developers should be aware that flag values may
    change between different versions of TrinityCore or patches, so hardcoded bitmasks
    should be used cautiously.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned value directly as it is a const reference to
    internal data. If you need to modify flags, use appropriate setter methods instead.
    Be cautious when checking flag values against hardcoded constants, as these may
    vary between different TrinityCore versions or custom modifications.
