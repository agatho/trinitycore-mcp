  signature: bool BotCharacterSelector::ValidateCharacter(int characterGuid, const
    int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a character GUID is acceptable for bot usage based on configured
    restrictions.
  description: The ValidateCharacter method checks whether a given character GUID
    meets all necessary criteria to be selected as a bot character. This includes
    verifying that the character is not already in use, is within allowed level ranges,
    and satisfies any other configured constraints such as faction, class, or account
    restrictions. The method returns true if the character is valid for bot usage,
    false otherwise. It's typically called during bot creation or assignment processes
    to ensure compliance with server rules and configuration settings.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to validate. This should
      be a positive integer representing a valid player character in the database.
  - name: request
    description: A reference to an integer value indicating the type or context of
      the validation request. The exact meaning depends on implementation but often
      represents a bot type, role, or configuration category.
  returns: Returns true if the character is valid for bot usage according to all configured
    rules and restrictions; false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    that the character is already in use, outside allowed level ranges, or violates
    other configured constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "int guid = 12345;\nint requestType = 1;\nbool isValid = selector.ValidateCharacter(guid,\
      \ requestType);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot creation or assignment\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in bot initialization
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    bool InitializeBot(int characterGuid,\
      \ int requestType)\n    {\n        if (!selector.ValidateCharacter(characterGuid,\
      \ requestType))\n        {\n            LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Invalid character\
      \ GUID {} for bot request type {}\", characterGuid, requestType);\n        \
      \    return false;\n        }\n        // Continue with bot initialization\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to check character status and
    configuration. It may cache results for performance optimization. The 'request'
    parameter allows for different validation logic depending on the intended use
    case, such as different bot types or roles.
  warnings: Ensure that characterGuid is a valid database entry before calling this
    method, as invalid GUIDs might cause undefined behavior or database errors. The
    method assumes proper initialization of the BotCharacterSelector instance and
    its configuration settings.
