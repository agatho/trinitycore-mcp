  class: PositionManager
  method: GenerateCircularPositions
  signature: int PositionManager::GenerateCircularPositions(const int & center, float
    radius, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of circularly positioned points around a specified center
    point.
  description: The GenerateCircularPositions method calculates and stores a series
    of evenly distributed positions along the circumference of a circle defined by
    a center coordinate and radius. This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as spell effects, area-of-effect targeting, or mob positioning where entities
    need to be placed in a circular formation. The method takes a center point identifier,
    a radius value, and the number of positions to generate, then populates internal
    data structures with the resulting coordinates. It returns an integer indicating
    success or failure of the operation, typically 0 for success and non-zero for
    errors.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: An integer identifier representing the center point around which
      circular positions will be generated. This is typically a reference to a specific
      location in the game world or an object's position index.
  - name: radius
    description: A floating-point value specifying the radius of the circle on which
      the positions will be placed. Must be a positive number greater than zero.
  - name: count
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating how many positions to generate
      along the circular path. The positions are distributed evenly around the circumference,
      with the first position typically aligned to a default orientation (e.g., north).
  returns: 'Returns an integer value: 0 on successful generation of all positions,
    or a non-zero error code indicating failure in processing the request. Possible
    errors may include invalid parameters such as negative radius or zero count.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Spell Effect
    code: "int result = positionManager.GenerateCircularPositions(1001, 5.0f, 8);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Positions successfully generated\n    // Use the\
      \ stored positions for spell effect visualization\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "const int centerPoint = GetPlayerPosition();\nconst float radius = 10.0f;\n\
      const uint32 numPositions = 12;\n\nint status = positionManager.GenerateCircularPositions(centerPoint,\
      \ radius, numPositions);\nif (status != 0) {\n    // Log error or handle failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to generate circular positions: %d\", status);\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with using the generated positions\n    for (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < numPositions; ++i) {\n        Position pos = positionManager.GetPosition(i);\n\
      \        // Apply effect at each position\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses trigonometric calculations (sine and cosine) to evenly
    distribute points around a circle. The internal storage mechanism for positions
    should be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments, though specific locking
    behavior is not guaranteed. Performance is generally O(n), where n is the count
    of positions generated.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter refers to a valid existing point; otherwise,
    undefined behavior may occur. Avoid using very large values for 'count' as it
    could lead to performance degradation or memory issues depending on internal implementation
    limits.
