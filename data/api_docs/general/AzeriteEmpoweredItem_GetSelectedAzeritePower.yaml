  method: GetSelectedAzeritePower
  signature: int AzeriteEmpoweredItem::GetSelectedAzeritePower(int tier) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the identifier of the selected Azerite power for the specified
    tier.
  description: The GetSelectedAzeritePower method returns the unique identifier (ID)
    of the currently selected Azerite power for a given tier within an Azerite Empowered
    item. This method is used to determine which Azerite power is active or selected
    at a specific tier level, allowing developers to query the current state of Azerite
    empowerment. The returned ID corresponds to an entry in the AzeritePower database
    table and can be used to fetch detailed information about the power's effects,
    prerequisites, and behavior. This method is typically called during item processing,
    tooltip generation, or when evaluating the active effects of an Azerite item.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the ID of the selected Azerite power for the specified
    tier. Returns 0 if no power is selected or if the tier is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Selected Power ID
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetAzeriteEmpoweredItem();\nint selectedPowerID\
      \ = item->GetSelectedAzeritePower(3);\nif (selectedPowerID > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the selected Azerite power\n    sLog->outString(\"Selected Azerite Power ID:\
      \ %d\", selectedPowerID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the item has been properly initialized with Azerite
    data. The tier parameter should be validated to ensure it falls within valid range
    (typically 1-5 for standard Azerite items). Performance is generally low as this
    involves accessing internal Azerite state data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid AzeriteEmpoweredItem
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the item actually contains Azerite
    data before calling this method to avoid incorrect results.
