  signature: uint32 Item::GetVisibleModifiedAppearanceId(const Player * owner) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the visible modified appearance ID for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier that represents the visual
    appearance of an item, including its modified appearance. The returned value corresponds
    to the ID used in the game client to display the item's appearance on players
    and NPCs. It is typically used in conjunction with player-specific data to determine
    how an item should be visually presented to a specific user. This method does
    not directly modify any item properties but rather accesses the stored appearance
    information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the visible modified appearance ID of the
    item, which corresponds to the ID used in game client visual data. If no modified
    appearance exists, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 1);

      uint32 appearanceId = item->GetVisibleModifiedAppearanceId(player);

      // Use appearanceId to determine visual representation

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the player's visible state
    to determine how an item should be displayed. It may return 0 if no modified appearance
    has been set or if the item does not support modified appearances.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the ID of the modified appearance;
    it does not modify or change any actual item properties. The returned value may
    vary based on player's visibility and game mechanics.
