  signature: void SpellCastTargets::RemoveSrc()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the source target from the spell cast targets collection.
  description: The RemoveSrc method removes the source target (the object or location
    from which a spell originates) from the SpellCastTargets container. This is typically
    used during spell casting logic to clear or modify the origin point of a spell
    before execution. The method does not take any parameters and performs no validation
    on whether a source target exists prior to removal. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this operation affects how the spell is interpreted in terms of its
    starting position or caster, particularly for spells that require a specific source
    location or object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Source Target Before Spell Cast
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetSrc(&caster);

      // ... other target setup

      // Remove the source before finalizing spell cast

      targets.RemoveSrc();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the SpellCastTargets object.
    It is typically called during spell preparation or validation phases, and should
    be used carefully to avoid unexpected behavior in spell targeting logic. The removal
    does not invalidate other targets (like dest or unit targets) within the same
    container.
  warnings: Calling RemoveSrc on a SpellCastTargets object that has not had a source
    set may result in no-op behavior, but it is still safe to call. Ensure that subsequent
    spell execution logic accounts for the absence of a source target if this method
    is used.
