  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: TransitionToPhase
  signature: void StartupSpawnOrchestrator::TransitionToPhase(StartupPhase newPhase)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the startup spawn orchestrator to a new phase in the initialization
    sequence.
  description: The TransitionToPhase method advances the internal state of the StartupSpawnOrchestrator
    to the specified phase, managing the sequential execution of game object spawning
    and initialization during server startup. This method ensures that entities are
    created and configured in the correct order based on their dependencies and initialization
    requirements. The orchestrator typically manages phases such as pre-spawn, spawn,
    post-spawn, and cleanup, with each phase performing specific tasks like loading
    templates, creating creatures/objects, and applying initial states. The method
    is designed to be called internally by the server's startup process and should
    not be invoked directly by external systems unless explicitly intended for custom
    initialization logic.
  parameters:
  - name: newPhase
    description: The target StartupPhase enum value to transition to. Valid values
      include phases such as PHASE_PRE_SPAWN, PHASE_SPAWN, PHASE_POST_SPAWN, and PHASE_CLEANUP.
      The method will validate that the new phase is a valid state in the initialization
      sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Transition
    code: 'StartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.TransitionToPhase(StartupPhase::PHASE_SPAWN);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sequential Phase Execution
    code: 'StartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.TransitionToPhase(StartupPhase::PHASE_PRE_SPAWN);

      orchestrator.TransitionToPhase(StartupPhase::PHASE_SPAWN);

      orchestrator.TransitionToPhase(StartupPhase::PHASE_POST_SPAWN);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the TrinityCore server's internal startup
    logic and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom initialization
    behavior. The method performs no validation on phase transitions beyond ensuring
    the new phase is a valid enum value, so calling it with an invalid phase may lead
    to undefined behavior or incomplete initialization.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid StartupPhase value can result in unexpected
    behavior or crashes during server startup. Ensure that only valid phases from
    the StartupPhase enumeration are used. Avoid calling this method outside of the
    intended initialization context as it may interfere with the normal startup sequence.
