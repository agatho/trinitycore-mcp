  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveTakeoff(uint32 id, const Position & pos, int tierTransitionId,
    int velocity, MovementWalkRunSpeedSelectionMode speedSelectionMode, int param5)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a takeoff movement for a creature or unit with specified parameters
    including position, velocity, and speed selection.
  description: The MoveTakeoff method is used to initiate a takeoff movement for a
    creature or unit in the World of Warcraft TrinityCore environment. This method
    typically triggers a flight animation or movement behavior that allows the unit
    to lift off from its current position. The movement is defined by a target position,
    velocity settings, and a speed selection mode. It's commonly used in AI behaviors
    for creatures that perform takeoff actions such as flying mobs or units with special
    movement capabilities. The method does not immediately execute the movement but
    rather queues it within the motion master system for processing.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this specific takeoff movement. Used to distinguish
      between different takeoff actions and can be referenced later for cancellation
      or modification.
  - name: pos
    description: Target position where the unit should take off from. This is a Position
      object containing X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation that defines the destination
      point.
  - name: tierTransitionId
    description: Identifier for tier transitions during takeoff. Used to determine
      which movement tier or phase this takeoff belongs to, particularly relevant
      in multi-tiered flight mechanics.
  - name: velocity
    description: Velocity value that controls the speed and direction of the takeoff
      movement. Positive values typically indicate upward or forward motion depending
      on context.
  - name: speedSelectionMode
    description: Enumeration value that determines how the movement speed is selected.
      This affects whether speed is calculated automatically, fixed, or based on specific
      criteria during takeoff.
  - name: param5
    description: Additional parameter for extended takeoff behavior configuration.
      The exact usage depends on implementation details and may control special effects
      or movement modifiers.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Takeoff Movement
    code: 'Position targetPos;

      targetPos.Relocate(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);

      MotionMaster* motionMaster = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      motionMaster->MoveTakeoff(1, targetPos, 0, 10, MovementWalkRunSpeedSelectionMode::DEFAULT,
      0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Takeoff with Custom Velocity and Speed Selection
    code: 'Position takeoffPos;

      takeoffPos.Relocate(500.0f, 300.0f, 150.0f);

      MotionMaster* motionMaster = unit->GetMotionMaster();

      motionMaster->MoveTakeoff(2, takeoffPos, 1, 25, MovementWalkRunSpeedSelectionMode::RUN,
      5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method integrates with the motion master's queue system and may not
    execute immediately. The actual movement behavior depends on the creature's AI
    state and movement capabilities. It's recommended to verify that the target position
    is valid and reachable before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling MoveTakeoff without proper validation of the target position or
    unit state may result in unexpected behavior or movement errors. Ensure that the
    unit has sufficient space for takeoff and that the movement parameters are within
    acceptable ranges.
