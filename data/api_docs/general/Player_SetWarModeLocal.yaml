documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's war mode state locally.
  description: This method enables or disables the player's war mode state within
    the local game environment. It controls whether the player is considered in a
    war mode state for gameplay mechanics purposes, such as combat behavior and PvP
    interactions. The method affects the player's local state without modifying the
    global server-wide war mode status. This functionality is typically used for managing
    player behavior in non-PvP zones or when transitioning between different game
    modes.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetWarModeLocal(true);

      // War mode enabled for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely modifies internal
    flags or state variables within the Player class to reflect war mode status. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it only updates local state variables, but thread
    safety should be considered when multiple threads access player objects simultaneously.
  warnings: This method does not affect global server-wide war mode settings; it only
    changes the local player state. Care must be taken when using this in conjunction
    with other war mode methods to avoid inconsistent behavior or unexpected PvP interactions.
