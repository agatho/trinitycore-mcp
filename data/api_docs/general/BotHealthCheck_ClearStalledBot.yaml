  signature: void BotHealthCheck::ClearStalledBot(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears a stalled bot from the health check system by its GUID.
  description: The ClearStalledBot method removes a specific bot identified by its
    GUID from the internal tracking system used for health checks. This function is
    typically invoked when a bot's health status has become stale or invalid, ensuring
    that the system does not continue to monitor or attempt to update the status of
    such bots. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's bot management
    system and is part of the BotHealthCheck class which handles monitoring of bot
    statuses. This action helps maintain system efficiency by preventing unnecessary
    processing of outdated or inactive bot entries.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be cleared from the health
      check system. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the system,
      otherwise the operation will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear a Stalled Bot by GUID
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      healthCheck.ClearStalledBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with valid bot GUIDs to avoid unintended
    behavior. The internal tracking mechanism may rely on the GUID being unique and
    properly registered in the system before this call is made.
