documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundScript instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundScript class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the lifetime of the battleground script. This method is automatically invoked
    when a BattlegroundScript object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It
    ensures proper resource deallocation and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore
    framework's battleground system. The destructor does not take any parameters and
    performs no specific game logic, serving purely as a cleanup mechanism for the
    script instance.

  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlegroundScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BattlegroundScript* bgScript = new BattlegroundScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete bgScript; // Destructor is called\
      \ here automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime through custom memory allocation strategies. In TrinityCore's
    context, battleground scripts are typically managed by the framework itself, so
    manual destruction is rare.
