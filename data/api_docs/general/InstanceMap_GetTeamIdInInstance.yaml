  method: GetTeamIdInInstance
  signature: int InstanceMap::GetTeamIdInInstance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team identifier associated with the instance map.
  description: The GetTeamIdInInstance method retrieves the team ID that is currently
    associated with this instance map. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    instances can be tied to specific teams (Alliance or Horde) for certain content
    types such as battlegrounds or world PvP zones. This method allows code to determine
    which faction's team owns or controls the instance. The returned value typically
    corresponds to either TEAM_ALLIANCE (0) or TEAM_HORDE (1), though custom implementations
    may use different values. This information is crucial for determining player access,
    rewards, and faction-specific mechanics within the instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the team ID associated with this instance map.
    Common return values are 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde. The method returns -1
    if no team is assigned or if the instance does not support team-based logic.
  examples:
  - title: Check Instance Team Ownership
    code: "InstanceMap* instance = player->GetInstance();\nif (instance)\n{\n    int\
      \ teamId = instance->GetTeamIdInInstance();\n    if (teamId == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n\
      \        SendSystemMessage(\"This instance is under Alliance control.\");\n\
      \    else if (teamId == TEAM_HORDE)\n        SendSystemMessage(\"This instance\
      \ is under Horde control.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in battleground and world PvP scenarios where
    instances have faction-specific ownership. It's important to note that not all
    instance types will have team associations, so checking for valid return values
    is recommended.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-negative return value always indicates a valid
    team assignment. Some instances might return -1 when no team is assigned or when
    the instance type doesn't support team-based logic.
