  class: Unit
  method: GetRaceMask
  signature: uint64 Unit::GetRaceMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the race mask of the unit, which determines the racial types and
    abilities available to the unit.
  description: The GetRaceMask method retrieves the race mask value associated with
    a Unit object, which represents the combination of all racial types that the unit
    can have. This value is used internally by TrinityCore to determine what racial
    abilities, skills, and traits are available for the unit. The race mask is typically
    derived from the unit's race and class, and it affects various gameplay mechanics
    such as skill points, talent trees, and race-specific abilities. This method is
    essential for determining the racial capabilities of a unit in the game context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the race mask of the unit, which encapsulates
    all possible racial types and their associated abilities. The value can be used
    to determine which races are available to the unit and how they interact with
    various game systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 raceMask = unit->GetRaceMask();\nif (raceMask & RACE_MASK_HUMAN)\
      \ {\n    // Handle human-specific behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other racial and class-related
    methods to determine the full set of capabilities available to a unit. It is important
    to note that race masks are not directly tied to player characters but also apply
    to NPCs and creatures in the game.
  warnings: The race mask returned by this method may vary depending on the unit's
    current state, such as whether it is a player or NPC, and can be affected by buffs
    or other gameplay effects. Care should be taken when using this value in conditional
    logic.
