  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CheckInterruptLineOfSight
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckInterruptLineOfSight(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the unit and the
    target for spell interruption purposes.
  description: The CheckInterruptLineOfSight method determines whether a direct visual
    path exists between the calling unit and a specified target unit, which is crucial
    for determining if spells or abilities can be interrupted by obstacles. This function
    evaluates the physical space between the two units to ensure no environmental
    or object-based barriers block the line of sight. It is typically used in spell
    casting systems where interruption mechanics rely on visual contact or unobstructed
    paths. The method returns true if there is a clear path, and false if any obstruction
    prevents direct line of sight.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the unit
    and the target, allowing for spell interruption effects to occur. Returns false
    if an obstacle blocks the line of sight, preventing such interruptions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Interruption Check
    code: "if (unit->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->CheckInterruptLineOfSight(target))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell interruption logic\n    target->InterruptSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying collision detection system and may be
    affected by terrain, objects, or other environmental factors. Performance can
    be impacted when checking many units simultaneously due to raycasting operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both the unit and target are valid pointers before calling
    this method, as invalid references may lead to undefined behavior. The method
    does not account for temporary invisibility effects or magical barriers beyond
    standard physical obstructions.
