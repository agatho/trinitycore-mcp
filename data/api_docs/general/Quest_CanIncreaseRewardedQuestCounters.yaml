documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest can increase rewarded quest counters
  description: This method checks if the current quest can contribute to increasing
    the player's rewarded quest counters. It evaluates various conditions related
    to quest completion and reward mechanics, including whether the quest is eligible
    for reward incrementation based on player's quest log status and game rules. The
    method returns true when the quest meets all criteria for increasing the counter,
    otherwise false. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate quest
    tracking and ensuring proper reward progression during quest completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest can increase rewarded quest counters, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the quest's reward conditions are met and the
    player's quest log allows for counter incrementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->CanIncreaseRewardedQuestCounters()) {\n    // Increment quest\
      \ counters\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest this method likely checks against player's
    quest log state and reward eligibility. Performance considerations include checking
    quest status before incrementing counters, which may involve multiple conditional
    checks.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining quest completion status
    directly; it only indicates whether the quest can contribute to counter increases.
    Common mistake is assuming this method implies quest completion when it actually
    only checks reward eligibility.
