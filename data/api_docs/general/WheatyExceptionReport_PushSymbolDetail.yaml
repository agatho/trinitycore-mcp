  method: PushSymbolDetail
  signature: SymbolDetail & WheatyExceptionReport::PushSymbolDetail()
documentation:
  brief: Adds and returns a new symbol detail entry to the exception report.
  description: The PushSymbolDetail method is used to append a new SymbolDetail object
    to the internal collection within the WheatyExceptionReport class. This method
    typically serves as part of an exception handling or crash reporting mechanism
    in TrinityCore, where detailed symbol information (such as function names, line
    numbers, and memory addresses) are collected for debugging purposes. It returns
    a reference to the newly added SymbolDetail object, allowing for immediate configuration
    or retrieval of its properties. The method is generally called during stack trace
    processing when an exception occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the newly created SymbolDetail object that was added to
    the report. This allows for direct manipulation of the symbol detail before or
    after insertion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handling
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report;

      SymbolDetail& detail = report.PushSymbolDetail();

      detail.SetFunctionName("SomeFunction");

      detail.SetLineNumber(123);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the crash reporting system and may
    not be intended for direct public use. The returned reference should be used carefully
    to avoid dangling references if the container is modified or destroyed.
  warnings: Ensure that the WheatyExceptionReport instance remains valid while using
    the returned SymbolDetail reference, as modifying or accessing it after destruction
    can lead to undefined behavior.
