  class: UnitAI
  method: GetData
  signature: uint32 UnitAI::GetData(uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves stored AI data value associated with the specified identifier.
  description: The GetData method retrieves a 32-bit unsigned integer value that has
    been previously stored using the SetData method within the UnitAI class. This
    functionality allows AI scripts and systems to maintain persistent state information
    for units during their lifecycle. The method is commonly used in custom AI implementations
    where unit-specific data needs to be accessed without relying on global variables
    or external storage mechanisms. It's important to note that this method only returns
    values that have been explicitly set using SetData, and attempting to retrieve
    data for an unset ID may return zero or undefined behavior depending on implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the 32-bit unsigned integer value associated with the provided
    identifier. If no value has been set for the given ID, the method typically returns
    zero, though this behavior may vary based on specific AI implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Custom AI State Data
    code: "uint32 currentPhase = me->GetAI()->GetData(1001);\nif (currentPhase ==\
      \ 2)\n{\n    // Execute phase 2 specific behavior\n    DoSomethingSpecial();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Data for Conditional AI Logic
    code: "Unit* target = me->GetAI()->GetTarget();\nuint32 attackCount = me->GetAI()->GetData(5001);\n\
      if (attackCount > 5)\n{\n    // Switch to aggressive mode\n    me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Continue with normal behavior\n    me->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GetData method is typically used in conjunction with SetData to maintain
    state within AI systems. It's designed for efficient access of small amounts of
    persistent data, making it suitable for tracking counters, flags, or simple state
    machines. The implementation may cache values for performance reasons, so changes
    made through SetData should be immediately reflected when calling GetData.
  warnings: This method assumes that the identifier passed to it has been properly
    set using SetData. Accessing unset identifiers may return unexpected values. Additionally,
    since this is part of the AI system, ensure thread safety considerations are taken
    into account when accessing data from different threads or during concurrent AI
    updates.
