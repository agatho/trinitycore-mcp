  class: Map
  method: GetEntrancePos
  signature: bool Map::GetEntrancePos(int32 & mapid, float & x, float & y)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entrance position coordinates for the current map.
  description: This method returns the entrance position coordinates (x, y) for the
    current map. It is used to determine where players should be teleported when entering
    a specific map instance. The method populates the provided parameters with the
    x and y coordinates of the entrance point, and returns true if successful, false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper map handling in World of Warcraft
    instances and is often used during player teleportation operations.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: Reference to the map ID where the entrance position is located. This
      parameter will be populated with the map ID value upon successful completion.
  - name: x
    description: Reference to the X coordinate of the entrance position. This parameter
      will be populated with the X coordinate value upon successful completion.
  - name: y
    description: Reference to the Y coordinate of the entrance position. This parameter
      will be populated with the Y coordinate value upon successful completion.
  returns: Returns true if the entrance coordinates are successfully retrieved, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if no entrance position is defined for
    the current map or if the coordinates cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nint32 mapid;\nfloat x, y;\nif (map->GetEntrancePos(mapid,\
      \ x, y)) {\n    // Use the coordinates for teleportation\n    printf(\"Map ID:\
      \ %d, X: %.2f, Y: %.2f\\n\", mapid, x, y);\n}\nelse {\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ get entrance position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with player teleportation logic
    and may be called during instance creation or when handling player entry into
    maps. The implementation relies on map-specific data structures and should be
    used carefully to avoid incorrect positioning.
  warnings: The method may return false if the map does not have an entrance defined,
    which could lead to incorrect teleportation behavior. Care must be taken when
    using this method in conjunction with other map-related functions.
