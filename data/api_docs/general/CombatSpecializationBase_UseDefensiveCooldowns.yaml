documentation:
  brief: Executes defensive cooldown usage logic for the combat specialization.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for activating and
    managing defensive cooldown abilities within a combat specialization. This method
    typically evaluates the current combat state, checks if defensive cooldowns are
    available and ready to use, and then applies them based on predefined conditions
    or triggers. It plays a crucial role in determining when and how defensive abilities
    such as shields, heals, or damage reduction effects are utilized during player
    or NPC combat encounters. The method is generally called by the AI system or combat
    logic during active combat scenarios.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat updates or AI decision-making
    cycles. It may be overridden in specialized combat specializations to implement
    custom defensive behavior logic.
