  signature: const int & Loot::GetLootMasterGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who has master looting
    rights for this loot object.
  description: The GetLootMasterGUID method retrieves the GUID of the player who is
    designated as the master looter for the current loot instance. In World of Warcraft's
    loot system, when a creature or container is looted, one player is selected to
    be the master looter, responsible for distributing the items among group members
    according to the group's loot rules (e.g., round-robin, free-for-all, etc.). This
    method allows access to that specific player's identifier. The returned GUID can
    be used to identify the master looter and perform operations such as checking
    permissions or sending loot-related messages. This method does not modify any
    internal state of the Loot object and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the GUID of the player
    who has master looting rights for this loot instance. If no master looter is assigned,
    it typically returns 0 or a default invalid GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use the loot master's GUID
    code: "Loot* loot = ...; // Assume loot object is initialized\nconst int& masterGUID\
      \ = loot->GetLootMasterGUID();\nif (masterGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Use the masterGUID\
      \ to identify the player\n    Player* masterPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ masterGUID));\n    if (masterPlayer)\n    {\n        // Perform actions with\
      \ the master looter\n        sLog->outString(\"Master looter is: %s\", masterPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid loot master has been assigned to the Loot
    object. The GUID returned corresponds to a player in the game world, and should
    be used carefully to avoid invalid memory access if the player is no longer present
    or has been deleted.
  warnings: Ensure that the Loot object is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as accessing an uninitialized or improperly set loot master may lead to
    undefined behavior. Also, be cautious when using the returned GUID in contexts
    where the player might have logged out or been removed from the game world.
