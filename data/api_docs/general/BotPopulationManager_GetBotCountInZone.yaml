  method: GetBotCountInZone
  signature: uint32 BotPopulationManager::GetBotCountInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of bots currently active within a specified zone.
  description: The GetBotCountInZone method returns the count of all bot characters
    that are currently present in the given zone. This functionality is typically
    used by bot management systems or administrative tools to monitor population density
    across different areas of the game world. The method operates on a per-zone basis
    and provides an aggregate count, which can be useful for balancing server resources,
    detecting overcrowding, or enforcing zone-specific bot limits. It's important
    to note that this count includes all bot types and does not differentiate between
    player-controlled bots and AI-driven ones unless specified otherwise by internal
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of bots currently active in
    the specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are present or if the zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 botCount = sBotPopulationManager->GetBotCountInZone(1234); // Gets\
      \ bot count in zone 1234\nif (botCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"There are\
      \ \" << botCount << \" bots in this zone.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Zone Population
    code: "void CheckZonePopulation()\n{\n    uint32 zoneId = 1519; // Eastern Kingdoms\n\
      \    uint32 currentBots = sBotPopulationManager->GetBotCountInZone(zoneId);\n\
      \    if (currentBots > 100)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Warning: High\
      \ bot population in zone %u with %u bots.\", zoneId, currentBots);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal data structures that track
    active bots per zone. It may involve iterating through a list of active bot instances
    or utilizing cached counts for performance reasons. The implementation might exclude
    bots that are in combat, dead, or otherwise inactive depending on the specific
    logic of the TrinityCore bot system.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided zone ID is valid and corresponds to an actual
    zone in the game world; invalid IDs may return unexpected results or cause errors.
    This method should not be called excessively in tight loops as it might involve
    internal lookups or calculations that could impact performance.
