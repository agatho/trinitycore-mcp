  class: World
  method: FindPlayerInZone
  signature: Player * World::FindPlayerInZone(uint32 zone)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a player object within the specified zone ID.
  description: The FindPlayerInZone method searches through all active players in
    the game world and returns a pointer to the first player found in the specified
    zone. This method is typically used for zone-based operations, such as sending
    zone-specific messages or triggering zone-related events. The method performs
    a linear search through the player list, which may have performance implications
    in high-player-density zones. It's important to note that this function returns
    only the first player found in the zone and not all players within it.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: The zone identifier (ZoneID) to search for players in. This corresponds
      to the zone ID defined in the game's database tables.
  returns: A pointer to a Player object if at least one player is found in the specified
    zone; otherwise, returns nullptr if no players are present in that zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a player in a specific zone
    code: "Player* player = sWorld->FindPlayerInZone(1234);\nif (player)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player found in zone 1234\n    player->SendNotification(\"Hello from zone\
      \ 1234!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No players found in zone 1234\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No players found in zone 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FindPlayerInZone for zone-based event triggering
    code: "void TriggerZoneEvent(uint32 zoneId)\n{\n    Player* player = sWorld->FindPlayerInZone(zoneId);\n\
      \    if (player)\n    {\n        // Perform zone-specific action\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 12345, true); // Example spell cast\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      No players in zone %u to trigger event.\", zoneId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all online players, so performance
    may degrade with large numbers of concurrent players. The returned Player pointer
    is valid only as long as the player remains in the zone and hasn't been deleted.
    This function does not account for sub-zones or instances; it searches based on
    the primary zone ID.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths,
    as it iterates through all players. Also, always check for nullptr before dereferencing
    the returned pointer to avoid crashes. The method only returns one player even
    if multiple exist in the same zone, so use with caution in scenarios requiring
    all players.
