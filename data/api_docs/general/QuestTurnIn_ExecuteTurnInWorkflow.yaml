  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteTurnInWorkflow(Player * bot, const QuestTurnInData
    & turnInData)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the quest turn-in workflow for a player, processing quest completion
    and reward distribution.
  description: The ExecuteTurnInWorkflow method handles the complete process of turning
    in a quest for a player character. It validates the quest requirements, checks
    if the player has completed all necessary objectives, processes any required items
    or currency, and distributes rewards such as experience points, gold, and items.
    This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with a quest giver NPC
    to turn in a completed quest. The workflow ensures proper state management and
    updates the player's quest log accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the quest turn-in
  - name: turnInData
    description: Reference to QuestTurnInData structure containing quest-specific
      turn-in information and requirements
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Execution
    code: 'QuestTurnInData data;

      data.questId = 12345;

      data.turnInType = TURN_IN_TYPE_NPC;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteTurnInWorkflow(playerBot, data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all prerequisite checks have been performed before
    invocation. It internally manages quest state transitions and reward distribution
    without requiring additional player interaction. The method may trigger quest
    completion events and update the player's quest log automatically.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of quest completion status
    may result in incorrect reward distribution or game state inconsistencies. Ensure
    that all quest objectives are properly validated before invoking this workflow.
