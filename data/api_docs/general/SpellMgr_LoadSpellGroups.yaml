documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell group definitions from the database into memory
  description: The LoadSpellGroups method is responsible for loading spell group data
    from the database tables into the SpellMgr's internal data structures. This method
    processes spell group associations, which define relationships between spells
    such as mutually exclusive groups, spell families, or other inter-spell dependencies.
    It typically executes during server startup or reload operations to ensure that
    all spell group configurations are properly loaded and available for spell validation
    and processing during gameplay. The method does not accept any parameters and
    performs no direct return value operations, but it modifies internal state within
    the SpellMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystems()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellGroups();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It should not be called repeatedly during normal gameplay as it may
    cause performance issues or duplicate data loading. The spell group data loaded
    by this method affects spell validation, cooldown handling, and certain spell
    interactions in the game.
  warnings: Calling LoadSpellGroups multiple times without proper cleanup can lead
    to memory leaks or inconsistent spell group states. This method should only be
    called when the database is fully initialized and accessible.
