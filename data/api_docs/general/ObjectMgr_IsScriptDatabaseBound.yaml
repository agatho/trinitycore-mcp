documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a script is bound to the database for the given identifier
  description: This method determines if a script associated with a specific identifier
    has been registered in the database. It is commonly used during object initialization
    or loading phases to verify that scripts are properly linked to their corresponding
    database entries. The check typically involves looking up the identifier in internal
    script binding tables or caches. This functionality ensures that only valid, database-bound
    scripts are executed, preventing runtime errors from orphaned or unregistered
    script references.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a script is bound to the database for the given identifier;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Script Binding Status
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsScriptDatabaseBound(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with script\
      \ execution\n    sLog->outString(\"Script is bound to database.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle unbound script case\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Script\
      \ not bound to database.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in an internal cache or registry of
    database-bound scripts. It may be called frequently during server startup or object
    creation, so performance is important. The method should be thread-safe if used
    in multi-threaded contexts.
