  class: Unit
  method: UpdateHeight
  signature: void Unit::UpdateHeight(float newZ)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the height (Z-coordinate) of the unit and adjusts its position accordingly.
  description: The UpdateHeight method modifies the vertical position (Z-coordinate)
    of a Unit object, typically used to adjust a creature or player's elevation in
    the game world. This method is commonly invoked during movement, jumping, falling,
    or when terrain height changes are detected. It ensures that the unit's collision
    detection and positioning remain accurate with respect to the surrounding environment.
    The method internally handles recalculating the unit's bounding box and may trigger
    updates to related systems such as visibility, pathfinding, or client-side rendering.
    This is a core part of TrinityCore's physics and positioning system.
  parameters:
  - name: newZ
    description: The new Z-coordinate value to set for the unit's vertical position.
      This represents the height above the ground level in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adjusting a Unit's Height After Jumping
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      float jumpHeight = 5.0f;

      player->UpdateHeight(player->GetPositionZ() + jumpHeight);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Unit to Ground Level
    code: 'Unit* npc = ...;

      float groundLevel = 100.0f;

      npc->UpdateHeight(groundLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the unit's physical
    position and may trigger cascading updates in movement, collision detection, and
    client synchronization. It is recommended to call this method only when necessary
    to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: Directly calling UpdateHeight without proper context or validation can
    cause issues with collision detection or visual positioning. Ensure that new Z-values
    are within valid bounds for the current map and zone.
