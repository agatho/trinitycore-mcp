  class: CooldownManager
  method: WillBeReadyIn
  signature: bool CooldownManager::WillBeReadyIn(uint32 spellId, uint32 timeMs) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell will be ready within the specified time frame.
  description: The WillBeReadyIn method determines whether a given spell will become
    available (ready) within the specified time interval. This is typically used to
    evaluate cooldown states for spells, abilities, or items in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment. The method checks the internal cooldown tracking system
    and returns true if the spell's cooldown will expire before the provided time
    limit, otherwise false. It is commonly used in spell validation logic, UI updates,
    and game state management.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check for readiness. This must
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: timeMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds to check against the spell's cooldown.
      If the spell will be ready within this time, the method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell will be ready within the given time
    frame (timeMs), otherwise false. A return value of true indicates that the spell
    is not currently on cooldown or that its cooldown period is less than the specified
    time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (cooldownManager.WillBeReadyIn(12345, 5000)) {\n    // Spell 12345 will\
      \ be ready in 5 seconds or less\n    SendSpellReadyMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Check for UI Updates
    code: "uint32 spellId = 98765;\nuint32 checkTime = 1000; // 1 second\nif (cooldownManager.WillBeReadyIn(spellId,\
      \ checkTime)) {\n    UpdateSpellButtonCooldown(spellId, 0); // Mark as ready\n\
      } else {\n    uint32 remainingTime = GetRemainingCooldown(spellId);\n    UpdateSpellButtonCooldown(spellId,\
      \ remainingTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the CooldownManager and assumes
    that all relevant cooldowns have been properly initialized. It does not modify
    any cooldown states but only performs a read-only check. The method may be used
    in performance-critical sections, so ensure proper caching or pre-computation
    where applicable.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with spells that do not have active
    cooldowns, as the behavior might vary depending on how the cooldown system handles
    inactive entries. Also, ensure that spellId is valid to avoid unexpected results
    or crashes.
