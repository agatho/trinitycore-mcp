api:
  class: BotCharacterCreator
  method: CanCreateCharacter
  signature: bool BotCharacterCreator::CanCreateCharacter(uint32 accountId, uint32
    & currentCount)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot character can be created for the specified account.
  description: The CanCreateCharacter method checks if the given account is allowed
    to create another bot character based on internal limits and game rules. It returns
    true if the character creation is permitted, and false otherwise. The method also
    updates the currentCount parameter with the number of bot characters currently
    associated with the account. This functionality is typically used in bot management
    systems within TrinityCore to enforce character creation limits per account.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which character creation
      is being checked. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  - name: currentCount
    description: Reference to an unsigned 32-bit integer that will be updated with
      the current number of bot characters associated with the specified account.
  returns: Returns true if the account is allowed to create another bot character,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to exceeding maximum character
    limits or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check character creation permission
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nuint32 currentCount = 0;\nBotCharacterCreator\
      \ creator;\nif (creator.CanCreateCharacter(accountId, currentCount)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with character creation\n    printf(\"Account %u can create a new\
      \ bot character. Current count: %u\\n\", accountId, currentCount);\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Account %u cannot create more bot characters. Current count: %u\\\
      n\", accountId, currentCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database storage to retrieve and update
    character counts for each account. It's important to note that this functionality
    is specific to bot character management and may not apply to regular player characters.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId provided corresponds to an actual existing account
    in the database, otherwise behavior is undefined. The currentCount parameter will
    always be updated regardless of whether character creation is permitted.
