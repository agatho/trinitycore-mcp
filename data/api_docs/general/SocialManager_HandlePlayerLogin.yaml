documentation:
  brief: Initializes social system state for a player upon login.
  description: The HandlePlayerLogin method is responsible for setting up and initializing
    the social networking components of a player's session when they log into the
    game. This includes loading friend lists, ignoring lists, and updating the player's
    online status within the social system. The method ensures that all social data
    is synchronized with the client upon login, allowing players to interact with
    their friends and manage their social settings immediately upon connection. It
    typically runs during the player login sequence before the character is fully
    loaded into the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player login flow
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    SocialManager::HandlePlayerLogin(this);\n\
      \    // Continue with other login procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core during the player
    login process. Developers should not need to invoke this directly unless implementing
    custom login logic. The method may perform database queries to load social data,
    so it could have performance implications for players with large friend/ignore
    lists.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the standard login flow as it may cause
    inconsistent state in the social system or duplicate entries in database tables.
    Ensure proper synchronization with the player's session state before calling.
