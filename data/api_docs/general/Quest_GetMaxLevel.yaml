  class: Quest
  method: GetMaxLevel
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetMaxLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum level allowed for this quest.
  description: The GetMaxLevel method retrieves the upper limit of player level that
    can accept this quest. This value determines at what level players can no longer
    progress through the quest, typically indicating the end of a quest chain or the
    point where quest completion becomes impossible due to level restrictions. The
    method is commonly used in quest scripting and quest validation logic to ensure
    proper progression and to prevent players from accepting quests beyond their capability.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the maximum player level at which this quest
    can be accepted and completed. A value of 0 indicates that the quest has no level
    restriction, while higher values indicate the highest level at which the quest
    remains valid for player progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxLevel = quest->GetMaxLevel();\nif (maxLevel > 0)\n{\n    // Quest\
      \ can only be completed up to this level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard quest API in TrinityCore and typically
    used in conjunction with GetMinLevel() to determine the full range of acceptable
    player levels for a quest. Performance considerations are minimal as it simply
    accesses stored data within the quest object.
  warnings: The method should not be confused with GetMinLevel(), which returns the
    minimum level required for a quest. Also, if the returned value is 0, it may indicate
    that the quest has no level restrictions or that the quest data is not properly
    initialized.
