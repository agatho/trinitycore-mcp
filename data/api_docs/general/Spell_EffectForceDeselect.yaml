documentation:
  brief: Force deselects the current target for a spell.
  description: This method forces the spell to deselect its current target, effectively
    removing any target selection that may have been set during the spell's execution.
    It is typically used in scenarios where the spell needs to clear its target state
    before proceeding with further operations or when a target is no longer valid.
    The method ensures that the spell's target selection is reset, allowing for proper
    handling of subsequent targetting mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectForceDeselect();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system when targetting
    needs to be reset. It may be used in conjunction with other methods that manipulate
    target selection or during spell cancellation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect targetting behavior,
    especially if used without proper context. Ensure that the spell's target state
    is properly managed before calling this method.
