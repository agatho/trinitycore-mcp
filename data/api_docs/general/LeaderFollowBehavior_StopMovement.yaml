  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: StopMovement
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::StopMovement(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the bot's movement and clears any ongoing movement behaviors.
  description: The StopMovement method halts the specified bot's current movement
    actions and resets its movement state. This function is typically used in AI behavior
    systems to interrupt or pause a bot's navigation, ensuring it stops moving regardless
    of its previous movement commands or pathfinding status. It may also clear any
    pending movement-related flags or waypoints associated with the bot's current
    behavior. The method operates on a single Player object representing the bot and
    does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose movement
      should be stopped. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SomeAIHandler(Player* bot)\n{\n    // Stop the bot from moving\n \
      \   leaderFollowBehavior.StopMovement(bot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Condition Check
    code: "if (bot->IsMoving())\n{\n    leaderFollowBehavior.StopMovement(bot);\n\
      \    // Perform other actions after stopping movement\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Bot\
      \ is already stopped, do nothing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in AI systems to avoid unintended
    behavior when the bot is expected to continue moving. It may affect pathfinding
    and movement-related flags within the TrinityCore AI framework.
  warnings: Calling StopMovement on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the Player object passed is valid before invoking this method.
