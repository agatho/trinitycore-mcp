  class: Creature
  method: IsFormationLeaderMoveAllowed
  signature: bool Creature::IsFormationLeaderMoveAllowed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can move while in formation.
  description: This method checks if a creature is allowed to perform movement actions
    while maintaining its formation with other creatures. It typically returns true
    when the creature is not currently engaged in combat or other restrictive conditions
    that would prevent movement. The method is commonly used in AI logic to determine
    if a creature should continue moving towards its formation leader or if it should
    remain stationary. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group
    behavior and preventing creatures from breaking formation during combat or movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is allowed to move while in formation, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the creature is currently
    in a state where movement is restricted, such as being in combat or under certain
    conditions that prevent formation movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsFormationLeaderMoveAllowed())\n{\n    // Allow movement\n\
      \    creature->MoveToFormationLeader();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Stay in place\n\
      \    creature->StopMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's AI behavior system and should be used
    carefully during movement logic implementation. It typically involves checking
    for combat state, movement restrictions, or other conditions that prevent formation
    movement.
  warnings: This method may return false even when a creature is not in combat if
    it has specific movement restrictions or if it's currently in a state where movement
    is prohibited. Care should be taken when using this method to ensure proper handling
    of movement logic.
