  class: Unit
  method: SetVignette
  signature: void Unit::SetVignette(uint32 vignetteId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vignette ID for the unit, which determines the visual representation
    of the unit in the game world.
  description: The SetVignette method assigns a specific vignette ID to a Unit object,
    controlling how the unit appears visually within the game environment. This method
    is typically used for setting visual effects or identifying units that have special
    display properties, such as NPCs or objects with unique visual representations.
    The vignette ID controls the appearance and behavior of the unit in terms of visual
    effects, including but not limited to, visual overlays, animations, or specific
    display characteristics. It's important to note that this method may affect how
    the unit interacts with other game systems, particularly those related to visual
    representation and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: vignetteId
    description: The unique identifier for the vignette to be set on the unit. This
      ID determines the visual appearance and behavior of the unit within the game
      world. Valid values are typically positive integers representing specific vignette
      IDs, with values ranging from 1 to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetVignette(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetVignette(12345);

      // This will set the visual representation of the unit

      // to match a specific vignette ID, affecting how it appears in game

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visual or gameplay-related
    methods. Implementation details may vary depending on how the unit's visual representation
    is handled internally. Performance considerations are minimal since this method
    only sets an ID, but it should be used carefully to avoid conflicts with other
    visual settings.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual representations
    of units in-game. It's important to ensure that the vignette ID corresponds to
    valid game data or else the unit may not display correctly. Also, setting a vignette
    ID without proper validation could result in undefined behavior or visual glitches.
