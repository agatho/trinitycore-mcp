    game states to maintain proper game mechanics.

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other battle pet management
    functions. It may be called automatically during certain game events or transitions,
    such as when entering combat or switching zones.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly during combat or while the player
    is in a state where battle pets are actively being summoned or managed. Calling
    this method in such situations could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of battle
    pet control.
