  class: BuffAction
  method: BuffAction
  signature: void BuffAction::BuffAction(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified spell as a buff to the target unit.
  description: The BuffAction method is used to apply a spell effect as a buff to
    a target unit within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically handles
    the logic for casting buffs, including validation of spell availability, targeting,
    and application of the spell's effects. It integrates with the core spell system
    to ensure proper buff mechanics such as stacking rules, duration management, and
    visual feedback. The method is commonly used in AI scripts or custom spell handlers
    where controlled buff application is required.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be applied as a buff. This
      must correspond to a valid spell entry in the database, and the spell must be
      of type buff (not harmful or utility).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Buff Application
    code: "void ApplyStrengthBuff(Unit* target)\n{\n    BuffAction(12345); // Applies\
      \ the Strength buff spell with ID 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Buff Casting
    code: "void CastHealingBuff(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target->GetHealthPct() <\
      \ 50)\n        BuffAction(12346); // Applies healing buff only when health is\
      \ low\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling context has proper access to the spell
    system and target unit. It may internally perform checks for spell validity, cooldowns,
    and targeting restrictions. Developers should ensure that the spellId corresponds
    to a valid buff spell in the database.
  warnings: Using an invalid spellId or attempting to cast a non-buff spell through
    this method may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that
    all spell IDs passed are verified to be of type buff before calling this method.
