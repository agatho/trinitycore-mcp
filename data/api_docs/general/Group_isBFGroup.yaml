documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is a Battlefront group.
  description: The isBFGroup() method checks if the current group is designated as
    a Battlefront group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, Battlefront
    groups are special group types used for specific game mechanics such as battlegrounds
    or world events. This method returns true if the group has been marked as a Battlefront
    group, and false otherwise. The check typically involves examining internal flags
    or properties set on the group object to determine its type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is a Battlefront group; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group is Battlefront Type
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->isBFGroup()) {\n\
      \    // Handle Battlefront group logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a Battlefront\
      \ group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal group flags or type identifiers that
    are set during group creation or when specific game events are triggered. It may
    be used in conjunction with other group-related methods to manage special gameplay
    scenarios.
