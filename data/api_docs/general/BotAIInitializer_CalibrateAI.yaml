documentation:
  brief: Initializes and calibrates the AI behavior for a bot character
  description: The CalibrateAI method performs the necessary setup and configuration
    to initialize the Artificial Intelligence system for a bot character within the
    TrinityCore framework. This process typically involves setting up default behaviors,
    configuring AI parameters, and ensuring that the bot's decision-making system
    is properly initialized before it begins interacting with the game world. The
    method may also handle synchronization of AI states with the current game environment
    and player conditions. It is generally called during bot creation or reinitialization
    to ensure proper AI functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI calibration was successful and all initialization
    steps completed without errors; returns false if any step in the calibration process
    failed, which may indicate issues with AI configuration, missing dependencies,
    or invalid game state conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Calibration Usage
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nbool success = initializer.CalibrateAI();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot AI is now calibrated and ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot AI calibrated successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle calibration failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to calibrate bot AI.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot is in a valid state for AI
    initialization. It may perform operations that require access to game data structures
    and should not be called from within critical sections or during asynchronous
    operations that could lead to race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method while the bot is actively engaged in combat or other
    complex AI behaviors may result in undefined behavior or incomplete calibration.
    Ensure that the bot is in a dormant state before invoking CalibrateAI.
