    class_) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default specialization entry for a given class from the ChrSpecialization
    DB2 file.
  description: This method fetches the default specialization entry associated with
    a specified player class. It is used to determine which specialization should
    be selected by default when a new character of that class is created, or when
    resetting to default specializations. The returned entry contains information
    such as the specialization's ID, name, icon, and other related data. This method
    assumes that the DB2 files have been properly loaded and parsed into memory. It
    performs a lookup based on the provided class ID and returns a pointer to the
    corresponding ChrSpecializationEntry structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const ChrSpecializationEntry object representing the default
    specialization for the specified class. Returns nullptr if no matching entry is
    found or if the DB2 data has not been loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Default Specialization for Warrior Class
    code: "const ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = sDB2Manager->GetDefaultChrSpecializationForClass(1);\
      \ // Class ID 1 is Warrior\nif (spec)\n{\n    printf(\"Default specialization\
      \ for Warrior: %s\\n\", spec->Name);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that must be initialized before
    calling. Ensure DB2 files are loaded prior to invoking this function. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the DB2Manager instance exists and its data remains
    unmodified.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer will always be valid; check for null
    before dereferencing. This method may return nullptr if the class ID does not
    map to a known specialization or if DB2 data is corrupted/missing.
