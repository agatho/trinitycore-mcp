  class: ThreatManager
  method: GetOwner
  signature: Unit * ThreatManager::GetOwner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the owner unit of the threat manager.
  description: The GetOwner method retrieves the Unit object that owns the ThreatManager
    instance. This is typically used in the context of creature AI or player-related
    threat systems where the threat manager tracks and manages the threat level of
    a specific unit. The method returns a pointer to the Unit object which represents
    the entity that initiated or owns the threat management system. This allows developers
    to access the owner's properties and methods for further processing or manipulation
    within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object that owns the ThreatManager. This
    pointer may be null if the ThreatManager has no owner, or it could point to either
    a player or creature unit depending on the context of the threat manager's usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* owner = threatManager->GetOwner();\nif (owner)\n{\n    // Do something\
      \ with the owner\n    std::cout << \"Owner is a: \" << owner->GetTypeId() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    functions to determine the source of threat or to retrieve the unit that generated
    the threat. It's important to note that this method does not perform any additional
    checks or validation on the returned pointer, so developers should ensure proper
    null checking before using it.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return a null pointer
    if the ThreatManager has no owner. Additionally, improper use of the returned
    Unit pointer can lead to memory access violations if the object has already been
    deleted or destroyed.
