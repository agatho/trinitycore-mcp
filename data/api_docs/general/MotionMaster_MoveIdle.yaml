  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveIdle()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an idle movement state for the object's motion controller.
  description: The MoveIdle method sets the current motion state of an object to idle,
    which typically means the object will cease any active movement and remain stationary.
    This is commonly used in AI behavior scripting to transition entities from moving
    states to a resting or waiting state. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no immediate action beyond setting the internal motion state flag.
    It is often called as part of a larger AI decision-making process where an entity
    needs to stop moving and enter a passive state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void ExampleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_isMoving)\n    {\n\
      \        // Stop movement and enter idle state\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle();\n\
      \        m_isMoving = false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only changes the motion state internally; it does not directly
    control the object's visual animation or position. The actual idle behavior depends
    on how the MotionMaster and associated movement generators handle the idle state.
    This method is typically called from within AI update loops or event handlers.
  warnings: Ensure that calling MoveIdle when the object is already in an idle state
    does not cause unexpected behavior. It's recommended to check the current motion
    state before calling this method if such checks are important for your use case.
