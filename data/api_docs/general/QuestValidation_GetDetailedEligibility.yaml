  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetDetailedEligibility
  signature: QuestEligibility QuestValidation::GetDetailedEligibility(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns detailed quest eligibility status for a player.
  description: The GetDetailedEligibility method performs a comprehensive validation
    of whether a player meets all requirements to accept a specific quest. It checks
    various conditions such as level requirements, previous quest completions, faction
    standing, item inventory, and other game-specific constraints. This method is
    typically used by quest systems to determine if a quest should be offered or accepted
    by a player. The returned QuestEligibility structure contains detailed information
    about which requirements are met or failed, allowing for precise feedback in quest-related
    UI or logic.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate eligibility for. Must
      be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      eligibility is being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns a QuestEligibility enum or structure containing detailed information
    about which requirements are satisfied or not met for the specified quest. Possible
    values may include success flags, requirement types that failed, and error codes
    indicating why the quest cannot be accepted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest eligibility
    code: "QuestEligibility eligibility = QuestValidation::GetDetailedEligibility(12345,\
      \ player);\nif (eligibility.IsEligible()) {\n    // Player can accept the quest\n\
      \    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle ineligibility\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not eligible for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using detailed eligibility to provide feedback
    code: "QuestEligibility eligibility = QuestValidation::GetDetailedEligibility(12345,\
      \ player);\nif (!eligibility.IsEligible()) {\n    std::string message = \"Quest\
      \ requirements not met:\";\n    if (!eligibility.HasRequiredLevel()) {\n   \
      \     message += \" Level too low\";\n    }\n    if (!eligibility.HasCompletedPreviousQuest())\
      \ {\n        message += \" Previous quest not completed\";\n    }\n    player->SendNotification(message);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and potentially complex checks, so
    it should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths. The method assumes
    that the quest ID exists in the game database and that the player object is valid
    and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is not null or invalid, as this
    could lead to undefined behavior. Also note that the QuestEligibility structure
    may contain multiple failure conditions, so all relevant checks should be evaluated
    rather than just a single flag.
