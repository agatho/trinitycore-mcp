  class: ThreatReference
  method: ModifyThreatByPercent
  signature: void ThreatReference::ModifyThreatByPercent(int32 percent)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the threat value by a specified percentage.
  description: The ModifyThreatByPercent method adjusts the current threat level of
    a ThreatReference object by applying a percentage change. This is commonly used
    in combat mechanics to increase or decrease an entity's threat towards a target,
    such as when a spell or ability modifies how much aggro a mob gains from a player.
    The method directly manipulates the internal threat value based on the provided
    percentage, which can be positive (increasing threat) or negative (decreasing
    threat). This modification affects the AI behavior of creatures and their targeting
    decisions in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The percentage by which to modify the threat value. Positive values
      increase threat, while negative values decrease it. The value is applied as
      a multiplier to the current threat level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase threat by 50%
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = ...;

      threatRef->ModifyThreatByPercent(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce threat by 25%
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = ...;

      threatRef->ModifyThreatByPercent(-25);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the threat value in-place and does not return a new
    value. It is typically called during combat events or spell effects to dynamically
    alter how much threat an entity has towards its target.
