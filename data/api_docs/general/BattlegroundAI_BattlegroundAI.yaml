documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BattlegroundAI instance with default values and setup routines.
  description: The BattlegroundAI constructor initializes the base AI behavior for
    battlegrounds within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal state
    variables, registers necessary event handlers, and prepares the AI system to manage
    player interactions, objective tracking, and game flow during battleground matches.
    It is automatically invoked when a new battleground instance is created and ensures
    that all required subsystems are properly initialized before gameplay begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Default Construction
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();

      // Initializes a new battleground AI instance with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating battleground instances. Developers should not manually instantiate
    BattlegroundAI objects directly unless implementing custom battleground logic.
    The initialization process includes setting up internal data structures and linking
    to the parent battleground object.
