  class: GridInfo
  method: incUnloadActiveLock
  signature: void GridInfo::incUnloadActiveLock()
documentation:
  brief: Increments the active unload lock count for the grid.
  description: The incUnloadActiveLock method increases the internal counter that
    tracks how many active locks are preventing a grid from being unloaded. This mechanism
    is used in TrinityCore's grid management system to ensure that grids remain loaded
    while there are active objects or processes that depend on them. The method typically
    gets called when a new object or process begins using the grid, and it must be
    paired with a corresponding decrement operation to allow the grid to be properly
    unloaded when no longer needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Activation
    code: "void Player::OnGridActivate()\n{\n    GridInfo* gridInfo = GetMap()->GetGrid(GetGridX(),\
      \ GetGridY());\n    gridInfo->incUnloadActiveLock();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal grid management system and
    should only be called when necessary to maintain proper grid loading/unloading
    behavior. It is typically used in conjunction with decUnloadActiveLock() to properly
    manage reference counting for grid unload prevention.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to grids remaining loaded indefinitely,
    causing memory leaks or performance degradation. Always ensure that every increment
    has a corresponding decrement.
