documentation:
  brief: Initiates or continues the engaging phase of combat for the AI-integrated
    unit
  description: The HandleEngagingPhase method manages the transition and execution
    of the engaging phase within the CombatAIIntegrator system. This phase typically
    occurs when a creature or NPC begins combat with a target, initiating aggressive
    behavior such as movement toward the target, casting spells, or performing melee
    attacks. The method evaluates current combat state, target validity, and AI configuration
    to determine appropriate engagement actions. It may also handle phase transitions
    between different combat states (e.g., from idle to engaging, or from engaging
    to fighting). This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system during
    combat lifecycle management.

  - title: Basic usage in combat state update
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \     m_combatAIIntegrator->HandleEngagingPhase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called during the AI update loop, typically
    when a unit enters combat. It assumes that the unit has a valid target and that
    combat state management is properly initialized.
