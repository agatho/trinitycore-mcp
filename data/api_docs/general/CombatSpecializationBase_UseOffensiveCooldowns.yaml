  brief: Executes all available offensive cooldowns for the combat specialization.
  description: The UseOffensiveCooldowns method is responsible for activating and
    applying all offensive cooldown abilities that are currently available within
    the combat specialization. This method typically manages the execution flow of
    cooldowns, ensuring they are used appropriately based on the current combat state
    and specialization rules. It may involve checking cooldown timers, validating
    target conditions, and triggering the appropriate ability usage logic. The method
    is generally called during combat scenarios where strategic use of offensive abilities
    is required to maximize damage output or tactical advantage.
