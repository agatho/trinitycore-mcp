documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current runic power value of the rune system
  description: The GetRunicPower method returns the current amount of runic power
    stored in the RuneSystem. This value represents the player's resource for using
    death knight abilities and is typically measured in units of 10 (i.e., a value
    of 100 represents 100% runic power). The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call at any time during gameplay. It provides access to the underlying
    runic power counter which is updated by the game engine based on player actions,
    regeneration rates, and ability usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current runic power amount. This value
    typically ranges from 0 to 1000, where 0 indicates no runic power available and
    1000 represents full runic power (100%).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 currentPower = player->GetRuneSystem()->GetRunicPower();\nif (currentPower\
      \ >= 100)\n{\n    // Player has enough runic power to use an ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Power for Ability Usage
    code: "RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();\nuint32 power = runeSys->GetRunicPower();\n\
      if (power >= 500)\n{\n    // Execute a high-cost death knight ability\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEATH_COIL, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Wait for more runic power to\
      \ regenerate\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough runic power.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the death knight rune system implementation and should
    only be called on death knight players. The returned value reflects the current
    state of the runic power counter, which is automatically updated by the game engine
    based on regeneration mechanics and ability consumption.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called on death knight characters to avoid
    undefined behavior. The returned value may change rapidly during gameplay due
    to ability usage and regeneration, so caching results for extended periods may
    lead to stale data.
