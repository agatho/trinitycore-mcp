  class: WildfireBombManager
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 WildfireBombManager::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of charges remaining on a Wildfire Bomb.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the number of active charges associated
    with a Wildfire Bomb instance. This value typically represents how many times
    the bomb can trigger its explosive effect before depleting. The method is const,
    indicating it does not modify the object's state. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this method would be used by spell systems or AI logic
    to determine the bomb's remaining functionality and manage its behavior accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of charges currently available on
    the Wildfire Bomb. A return value of zero indicates that the bomb has no remaining
    charges and is effectively inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "uint32 charges = wildfireBomb->GetCharges();\nif (charges > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Proceed with bomb activation logic\n    wildfireBomb->Explode();\n    wildfireBomb->DecrementCharges();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Charges Before Applying Effects
    code: "if (wildfireBombManager->GetCharges() >= 3)\n{\n    // Apply enhanced effects\
      \ due to high charge count\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_ENHANCED_WILDFIRE_BOMB);\n\
      }\nelse if (wildfireBombManager->GetCharges() == 0)\n{\n    // Remove bomb from\
      \ player's inventory or disable it\n    player->RemoveAura(SPELL_WILDFIRE_BOMB);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other WildfireBombManager
    methods such as IncrementCharges(), DecrementCharges(), and SetCharges(). The
    implementation likely involves a simple member variable storage mechanism that
    tracks the current charge count.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called on a null pointer to the WildfireBombManager
    instance, as it would result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that calling
    GetCharges() repeatedly without proper synchronization in multithreaded contexts
    might return inconsistent values if other threads are modifying the charge count.
