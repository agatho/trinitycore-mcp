documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a packet for the player who joined a
    channel.
  description: The Append method is used to populate a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data relevant to a player joining a channel. This method is typically
    invoked when a player successfully joins a chat channel, and it ensures that the
    appropriate notification message is sent to the client. The method modifies the
    provided packet in-place by adding necessary fields such as the channel name,
    player's name, and other metadata required for the client to display the join
    notification correctly. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's channel
    management system and is part of the broader packet handling infrastructure for
    chat functionality.

    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      YouJoinedAppend append;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the channel system when a player
    joins a channel. It assumes that the packet object passed to it is properly initialized
    and ready to receive data. The method does not perform any validation on the input
    packet, so callers should ensure correctness before invoking this method.
