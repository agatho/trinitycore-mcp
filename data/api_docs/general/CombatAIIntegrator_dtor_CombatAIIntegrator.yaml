  method: ~CombatAIIntegrator
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::~CombatAIIntegrator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CombatAIIntegrator instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CombatAIIntegrator class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were acquired during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation and prevents
    memory leaks when an instance of CombatAIIntegrator goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor likely handles
    cleanup of combat-related AI state, such as removing references to creature targets,
    clearing internal data structures used for combat decision-making, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers remain in the game's memory space.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of CombatAIIntegrator instance
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator* ai = new CombatAIIntegrator();

      // ... use the AI instance ...

      delete ai; // Triggers the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a CombatAIIntegrator object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destructor should be noexcept to prevent
    exceptions during stack unwinding.
