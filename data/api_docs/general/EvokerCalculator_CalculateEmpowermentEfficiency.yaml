  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: CalculateEmpowermentEfficiency
  signature: float EvokerCalculator::CalculateEmpowermentEfficiency(int spellId, EmpowermentLevel
    level, int * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the efficiency of an empowerment effect based on spell ID, empowerment
    level, and caster information.
  description: The CalculateEmpowermentEfficiency method computes a float value representing
    how effectively an empowerment effect is applied to a spell. This method takes
    into account the specific spell being empowered, the level of empowerment (which
    may affect potency or duration), and references the caster's data to determine
    the efficiency. It is typically used in Evoker class mechanics where spells can
    be enhanced through empowerment effects. The result is a normalized efficiency
    score that can be used for balancing, UI display, or gameplay calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being empowered. Must correspond
      to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: level
    description: The empowerment level which determines the strength or enhancement
      of the effect. Should be a valid EmpowermentLevel enum value.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's identifier or data.
      May be used for additional context in efficiency calculations.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the calculated efficiency
    of the empowerment effect. A value of 1.0 represents maximum efficiency, while
    0.0 indicates no effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float efficiency = calculator.CalculateEmpowermentEfficiency(12345, EmpowermentLevel::LEVEL_TWO,
      &casterId);
    language: cpp
  - title: Efficiency Check with Conditional Logic
    code: "int casterId = 42;\nfloat efficiency = calculator.CalculateEmpowermentEfficiency(12345,\
      \ EmpowermentLevel::LEVEL_THREE, &casterId);\nif (efficiency > 0.8f) {\n   \
      \ // Apply enhanced effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger spell calculation system and may interact
    with other methods to determine total spell effectiveness. The exact formula for
    efficiency calculation is not specified in the signature, but it's assumed to
    be based on internal game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid spell entry in the database;
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. The caster pointer
    should point to a valid entity to prevent memory access violations.
