    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a trainer can teach a specific spell to a player.
  description: The CanTeachSpell method evaluates if a given trainer is capable of
    teaching a specified spell to a particular player. This check typically involves
    verifying that the trainer has the appropriate spell in their training list, that
    the player meets prerequisites such as skill levels or quest requirements, and
    that the spell is not already known by the player. The method is commonly used
    within the context of NPC trainer interactions to control what spells are available
    for learning.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object requesting to learn the spell. Must
      be a valid player instance.
  - name: trainerSpell
    description: A pointer to the Spell object representing the spell that the trainer
      might teach. Must be a valid spell instance.
  returns: Returns true if the trainer can teach the specified spell to the player,
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in trainer interaction
    code: "if (trainer->CanTeachSpell(player, spell)) {\n    // Proceed with teaching\
      \ the spell\n    player->LearnSpell(spell->Id);\n} else {\n    // Inform player\
      \ they cannot learn this spell\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot learn\
      \ this spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks against player's skill levels, quest completion
    status, and spell prerequisites. It is typically called before attempting to teach
    a spell to avoid invalid operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and trainerSpell parameters are valid pointers;
    otherwise, the behavior is undefined. This method does not modify any state directly
    but only evaluates conditions for teaching.
