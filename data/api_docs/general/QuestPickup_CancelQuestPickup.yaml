  class: QuestPickup
  method: CancelQuestPickup
  signature: void QuestPickup::CancelQuestPickup(uint32 questId, uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels a quest pickup for a specific bot and quest ID.
  description: The CancelQuestPickup method removes or cancels an active quest pickup
    state for a specified bot and quest. This function is typically used in automated
    questing systems or botting frameworks within the TrinityCore environment to reset
    or abort a quest pickup operation. It ensures that the quest state is properly
    cleaned up and that no further pickup-related actions are performed for the given
    quest ID associated with the specified bot GUID. The method does not return any
    value, indicating it performs an action rather than retrieving data.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to cancel the pickup for. Must
      be a valid quest ID registered in the game database.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the bot associated with the
      quest pickup. This identifies which specific bot's quest pickup state should
      be canceled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cancel a quest pickup for a specific bot
    code: 'QuestPickup::CancelQuestPickup(12345, 67890);

      // Cancels the pickup of quest ID 12345 for the bot with GUID 67890.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest automation or botting system.
    It assumes that the quest and bot are already initialized in the game state. The
    implementation may involve clearing internal tracking structures or resetting
    flags associated with the quest pickup process.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId and botGuid are valid before calling
    this method to prevent undefined behavior or assertion failures. Improper use
    of this function in a multi-threaded environment could lead to race conditions
    if not properly synchronized.
