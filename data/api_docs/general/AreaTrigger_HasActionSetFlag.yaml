  method: HasActionSetFlag
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::HasActionSetFlag(int flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific action set flag is enabled for the area trigger.
  description: The HasActionSetFlag method determines whether a particular flag within
    the area trigger's action set is currently active. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage conditional behaviors and interactions
    based on defined flags. The method performs a bitwise check against the internal
    flag storage of the area trigger, returning true if the specified flag is set,
    and false otherwise. It is typically invoked during area trigger activation or
    event processing to control behavior flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified action set flag is enabled; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Check
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasActionSetFlag(AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_ALLOW_MOUNTED)) {\n\
      \    // Perform action when mounted movement is allowed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Multiple Flags
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasActionSetFlag(AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_CAST_SPELL_ON_ENTER)\
      \ &&\n    areaTrigger->HasActionSetFlag(AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_SEND_EVENT)) {\n \
      \   // Execute complex trigger behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the flag parameter represents a valid bit position
    within the action set mask. The implementation likely uses bitwise operations
    for performance optimization. Developers should ensure that flag values are properly
    defined and consistent with the area trigger's expected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the flag value passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual defined flag in the area trigger system. Using invalid or undefined
    flag values may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
