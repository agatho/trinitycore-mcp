documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables debug logging for bot packet relay operations.
  description: The SetDebugLogging method controls whether detailed debug information
    is logged for bot packet relay activities within the TrinityCore framework. When
    enabled, this feature will output verbose logs related to packet handling, transmission,
    and processing for bot clients. This functionality is primarily used during development
    and troubleshooting to monitor the behavior of bot communication with the game
    server. The setting persists until explicitly changed again, affecting all subsequent
    bot packet relay operations.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Debug Logging
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.SetDebugLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Debug Logging
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.SetDebugLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects logging verbosity globally for the BotPacketRelay instance.
    It is recommended to disable debug logging in production environments due to potential
    performance impact from excessive log output.
