  method: HasThrash
  signature: bool GuardianThrashTracker::HasThrash(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a guardian has an active thrash effect based on the provided GUID.
  description: The HasThrash method determines whether a specific guardian unit, identified
    by its unique identifier (GUID), currently has an active thrash effect applied
    to it. This functionality is typically used in AI logic for guardians to track
    and manage their combat abilities and cooldowns. The method performs a lookup
    within the internal tracking structure of the GuardianThrashTracker class to verify
    if the specified GUID corresponds to a guardian with an ongoing thrash effect.
    It's commonly invoked during AI decision-making processes to avoid redundant or
    conflicting ability usage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guardian unit to check for active
      thrash effect. This should be a valid GameObject or Creature GUID used in TrinityCore's
      object management system.
  returns: Returns true if the guardian with the specified GUID currently has an active
    thrash effect; otherwise, returns false. The method does not throw exceptions
    and handles invalid GUIDs gracefully by returning false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (guardianThrashTracker.HasThrash(targetGuid)) {\n    // Skip thrash\
      \ ability since target already has thrash\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with applying\
      \ thrash to target"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guardian AI Update Loop
    code: "void GuardianAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (HasThrash(m_creature->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n        // Guardian is currently thrashing, skip other abilities\n    \
      \    return;\n    }\n    // Normal AI logic continues here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GuardianThrashTracker maintains an internal
    data structure (likely a map or set) of active thrash effects. The implementation
    should be efficient, as it may be called frequently during AI updates. Consider
    thread safety if this method is accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method refers to a valid guardian
    unit; passing an invalid or non-guardian GUID will simply return false without
    error. Be cautious when using this in performance-critical code paths due to potential
    lookup overhead.
