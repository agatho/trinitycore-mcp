documentation:
  brief: Processes smart script events for a given unit and event type.
  description: The ProcessEventsFor method is responsible for triggering and executing
    smart script events associated with a specific unit and event type. It evaluates
    conditions, runs actions, and manages the flow of AI behavior based on the provided
    event parameters. This method is typically invoked by the game engine when an
    event occurs that should trigger smart script logic, such as a unit entering combat
    or receiving damage. The method handles various event types through the SMART_EVENT
    enum and uses the provided parameters to determine how to process each event.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: The SMART_EVENT type that defines which event is being processed.
      This determines what conditions and actions should be evaluated.
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which the event is being processed.
      This represents the entity that triggered or is affected by the event.
  - name: var0
    description: Variable parameter 0 used in event processing, often representing
      a specific value or ID related to the event context.
  - name: var1
    description: Variable parameter 1 used in event processing, typically used for
      additional contextual data or parameters relevant to the event.
  - name: bvar
    description: Boolean variable that can be used to pass a true/false flag into
      the event processing logic.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the spell associated
      with the event, or NULL if no spell is involved.
  - name: gob
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that may be related to the event, or NULL
      if no game object is involved.
  - name: varString
    description: Integer variable used for string-based parameters in smart scripts,
      typically representing a string index or identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Processing a 'JustDied' event for a unit
    code: 'SmartScript* script = unit->GetAI();

      script->ProcessEventsFor(SMART_EVENT_JUST_DIED, unit, 0, 0, false, nullptr,
      nullptr, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing a 'SpellHit' event with spell data
    code: 'SmartScript* script = unit->GetAI();

      const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      script->ProcessEventsFor(SMART_EVENT_SPELLHIT, unit, 0, 0, false, spellInfo,
      nullptr, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the smart scripting system used in TrinityCore for
    AI behavior implementation. It's designed to be called internally by the core
    engine when events occur rather than directly by external code. The method performs
    event evaluation and action execution, so it may have performance implications
    if called excessively or with complex conditions.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method should be avoided unless you understand
    the smart script system thoroughly. Improper use can lead to unexpected AI behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method, especially
    when passing pointers like unit or spell.
