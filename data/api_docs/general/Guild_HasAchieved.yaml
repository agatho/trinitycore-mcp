documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the guild has achieved a specific achievement.
  description: The HasAchieved method determines if a guild has earned a particular
    achievement by checking its internal achievement tracking system. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with the World of Warcraft achievement system
    to verify guild accomplishments such as completing specific quests, reaching certain
    member counts, or achieving milestones in guild activities. The method performs
    a simple lookup within the guild's stored achievements and returns true if the
    specified achievement ID exists in that collection, otherwise false. It does not
    modify any state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the guild has earned the specified achievement, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Check
    code: "if (guild->HasAchieved(12345))\n{\n    // Guild has achieved achievement\
      \ ID 12345\n    sLog->outString(\"Guild has completed the achievement.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Achievement
    code: "uint32 guildAchievementId = 67890;\nif (guild->HasAchieved(guildAchievementId))\n\
      {\n    // Grant special rewards or permissions\n    guild->BroadcastToGuild(\"\
      Congratulations! Guild has achieved a milestone.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Notify\
      \ that achievement is still pending\n    guild->BroadcastToGuild(\"Keep working\
      \ towards the guild achievement!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal achievement tracking system of the guild,
    which may be updated asynchronously during gameplay. The achievement IDs should
    correspond to valid entries in the game's achievement database. Performance is
    generally fast as it performs a simple lookup operation.
