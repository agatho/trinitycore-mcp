  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculateSpreadFormation
  signature: int PositionStrategyBase::CalculateSpreadFormation(int bots, Unit * target,
    float minSpacing)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates optimal spread formation positions for a group of bots around
    a target unit.
  description: The CalculateSpreadFormation method determines the ideal spatial distribution
    of multiple bot units around a specified target unit, ensuring they maintain a
    minimum required spacing. This functionality is typically used in AI systems to
    create natural-looking group positioning during combat or movement scenarios.
    The method evaluates the number of bots, their target, and the desired minimum
    spacing to compute an appropriate formation layout that avoids overcrowding while
    maintaining tactical effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: bots
    description: The total number of bot units that need to be positioned in the spread
      formation. Must be a positive integer representing the count of AI-controlled
      units.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the central point around
      which bots will be spread. This can represent an enemy, ally, or neutral target
      depending on context.
  - name: minSpacing
    description: The minimum distance that must be maintained between any two bot
      units in the formation. Must be a positive floating-point value representing
      the spacing in game units (e.g., yards).
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the success status of the calculation: 0
    for successful completion, negative values for errors such as invalid parameters
    or insufficient space to accommodate all bots with required spacing.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int result = positionStrategy.CalculateSpreadFormation(3, targetUnit, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int bots = 5;\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\nfloat spacing = 3.0f;\n\
      int status = positionStrategy.CalculateSpreadFormation(bots, target, spacing);\n\
      if (status < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Failed\
      \ to calculate spread formation for {} bots with {} spacing.\", bots, spacing);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible within the
    current game context. It may perform internal calculations involving pathfinding
    or collision detection to ensure realistic positioning. The returned value should
    be checked for validity before proceeding with any further operations based on
    the calculated formation.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for the 'target' parameter as this will likely
    cause a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the minimum spacing is sufficient
    to allow all bots to be positioned without overlapping, especially when dealing
    with large numbers of units.
