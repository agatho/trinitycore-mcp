  signature: void ResourceManager::~ResourceManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ResourceManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ResourceManager destructor is automatically invoked when a ResourceManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of all allocated memory and resources managed by the ResourceManager,
    including any loaded data files, cached objects, or internal resource pools. In
    the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor plays a critical role
    in preventing memory leaks during server shutdown or when resource managers are
    dynamically reloaded. The destruction process typically involves releasing references
    to loaded databases, clearing caches, and ensuring that no dangling pointers remain
    in the system.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ResourceManager* rm = new ResourceManager();\n\
      \    // ... use the resource manager ...\n    delete rm; // Triggers ~ResourceManager\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    ResourceManager rm; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the resource manager ...\n    // ~ResourceManager automatically\
      \ called on exit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically non-blocking and should complete quickly to avoid
    server lag during shutdown. It's important to note that ResourceManager instances
    should not be accessed after their destruction has begun, as this can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless you're certain about object
    lifetime management. Calling ~ResourceManager directly on an already destroyed
    object will result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure all references to the ResourceManager
    are cleared before it goes out of scope.
