documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed optimization report for bot memory usage and performance
    metrics.
  description: The GenerateOptimizationReport method creates a comprehensive textual
    report detailing current bot memory management statistics, including allocated
    memory blocks, usage patterns, and potential optimization opportunities. This
    method is typically used by developers or administrators to analyze and improve
    the efficiency of bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. The generated
    report can be utilized for debugging memory leaks, identifying performance bottlenecks,
    or optimizing bot behavior configurations. The report includes information about
    memory allocation sizes, fragmentation levels, and other relevant metrics that
    help in understanding how bot resources are being consumed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string report;

      botMemoryManager->GenerateOptimizationReport(report);

      LOG_INFO("server", "Bot memory optimization report:\n{}", report);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving Report to File
    code: 'std::string report;

      botMemoryManager->GenerateOptimizationReport(report);

      std::ofstream file("bot_memory_report.txt");

      file << report;

      file.close();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full scan of the current memory state and may have
    performance implications during high-traffic periods. The report generation process
    is not thread-safe and should be called from a single-threaded context to avoid
    data inconsistencies. Memory statistics are collected at the time of invocation,
    so any changes made after calling this method will not be reflected in the generated
    report.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during active bot operations may cause
    temporary performance degradation due to memory scanning overhead. The report
    should not be used for real-time decision making as it reflects a snapshot of
    memory state at the time of generation.
