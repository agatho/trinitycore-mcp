documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AoEDecisionManager instance with the provided BotAI context.
  description: The AoEDecisionManager constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AoEDecisionManager class, associating it with a specific BotAI instance. This
    manager is responsible for making decisions related to area-of-effect spell usage
    within the bot's AI behavior. It sets up internal state and references needed
    for evaluating and executing AoE-based actions during combat. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary dependencies are properly linked to the provided BotAI
    context, allowing the manager to access relevant game data and decision-making
    utilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: AoEDecisionManager aoeManager(botAI);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    establishes the link between the AoEDecisionManager and the BotAI instance, making
    it ready for subsequent method calls that involve AoE decision-making.
