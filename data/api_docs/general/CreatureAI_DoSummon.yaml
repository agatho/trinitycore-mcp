  class: CreatureAI
  method: DoSummon
  signature: Creature * CreatureAI::DoSummon(int entry, WorldObject * obj, float radius,
    int despawnTime, int summonType)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a creature of the specified entry near the given object within the
    provided radius.
  description: The DoSummon method is used by CreatureAI to spawn a new creature instance
    in the world. It creates a summoned creature at or near the location of the specified
    WorldObject, using the given entry ID for the creature type. The summoned creature
    will automatically despawn after the specified time unless otherwise configured.
    This method is commonly used in AI scripts for summoning minions, pets, or other
    creatures during combat or special events. The summoning process respects the
    game's object placement rules and can be used to create complex AI behaviors involving
    multiple summoned units.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID that defines what type of creature will be
      summoned. This corresponds to the 'entry' field in the creature_template table.
  - name: obj
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject (such as a player or creature) that
      serves as the reference point for summoning. The summoned creature will appear
      near this object.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance from the reference object where the summoned
      creature can appear. A value of 0 typically means the creature spawns at the
      exact location of the reference object.
  - name: despawnTime
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the summoned creature will automatically
      despawn. A value of 0 means the creature will not despawn automatically.
  - name: summonType
    description: The type of summoning behavior to use, typically defined by constants
      like SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE, SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN, etc. Controls how the summoned
      creature behaves and interacts with its summoner.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the newly created Creature object if successful, or
    NULL if the summoning failed due to invalid parameters or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic creature summon
    code: "Creature* summoned = me->DoSummon(12345, me->GetVictim(), 5.0f, 60000,\
      \ SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE);\nif (summoned)\n{\n    summoned->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Summon guardian with custom despawn time
    code: "Creature* guardian = me->DoSummon(67890, me, 3.0f, 30000, SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN);\n\
      if (guardian)\n{\n    guardian->SetOwnerGUID(me->GetGUID());\n    guardian->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The summoned creature inherits properties from the template defined by the
    'entry' parameter. The method uses the WorldObject's location and orientation
    to determine where to place the summoned creature within the specified radius.
    This function is typically called from AI scripts during combat or event handling,
    so it should be used carefully to avoid performance issues with too many simultaneous
    summons.
  warnings: Calling DoSummon with invalid entry IDs or NULL objects will result in
    failed summoning and return NULL. Be cautious about summoning too many creatures
    at once as this can cause performance degradation. The despawnTime parameter must
    be carefully considered to prevent memory leaks from persistent summoned creatures.
