documentation:
  brief: Selects a new leader for the group when the current leader leaves or is removed
    from the group.
  description: The SelectNewPartyOrRaidLeader method is responsible for automatically
    assigning a new leader to a group when the existing leader is no longer part of
    the group. This typically occurs when a player leaves the group, is kicked, or
    becomes disconnected. The method evaluates the remaining group members and selects
    the most suitable candidate based on predefined criteria such as role, level,
    or presence in the group. It ensures that groups maintain leadership continuity
    to preserve functionality like loot distribution, group management, and raid coordination.
    This method is usually invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    group state changes.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Leader Selection
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeaveGroup(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        group->RemoveMember(player->GetGUID());\n  \
      \      group->SelectNewPartyOrRaidLeader(); // Automatically selects new leader\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Group class when a member
    leaves or is removed from the group. It does not require explicit invocation in
    most cases, but can be used to manually trigger leadership reassignment if needed.
