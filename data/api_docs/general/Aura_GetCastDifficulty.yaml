  class: Aura
  method: GetCastDifficulty
  signature: int Aura::GetCastDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cast difficulty level associated with the aura.
  description: The GetCastDifficulty method returns an integer value representing
    the difficulty level at which the aura was cast. This value is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's combat and spell system to determine how the aura behaves
    based on the caster's or target's difficulty settings, such as in raid encounters
    or dungeon scenarios. The returned value may influence effects like damage scaling,
    duration, or activation conditions depending on the specific implementation of
    the aura.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cast difficulty level of the aura. Possible
    values are typically 0 (normal), 1 (heroic), 2 (mythic), or other custom difficulty
    levels defined by the server configuration or expansion content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nint difficulty = aura->GetCastDifficulty();\n\
      if (difficulty == 1) {\n    // Apply heroic-specific effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Difficulty in Conditional Logic
    code: "Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(67890);\nint difficulty = aura->GetCastDifficulty();\n\
      switch (difficulty) {\n    case 0:\n        // Normal mode effect\n        break;\n\
      \    case 1:\n        // Heroic mode effect\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Default or unknown difficulty\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in custom spell implementations or when handling
    raid-specific mechanics where aura behavior changes based on encounter difficulty.
    The value returned should be interpreted within the context of the server's difficulty
    definitions.
  warnings: Ensure that the aura object is valid before calling this method, as accessing
    a null aura may lead to undefined behavior. Also, note that not all auras will
    have meaningful difficulty values depending on how they were applied.
