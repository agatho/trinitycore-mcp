  signature: void Mail::AddItem(int itemGuidLow, uint32 item_template)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to the mail message with the specified item GUID and template
    ID.
  description: The AddItem method is used to attach an item to a mail message in the
    TrinityCore database system. This method takes a low GUID of an item and its template
    ID, and associates them with the current mail object. The item will be physically
    stored in the mailbox system and can be retrieved by the recipient at a later
    time. This functionality is commonly used when sending items as rewards, loot,
    or gifts through the in-game mail system. The method does not validate whether
    the item actually exists in the database; it simply adds the reference to the
    mail's item list.
  parameters:
  - name: itemGuidLow
    description: The low GUID of the item to be added to the mail. This value identifies
      a specific item instance within the database.
  - name: item_template
    description: The template ID of the item being added. This defines the properties
      and characteristics of the item, such as its name, type, and stats.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a simple item to mail
    code: 'Mail* mail = new Mail();

      mail->AddItem(12345, 45678);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple items to mail
    code: 'Mail* mail = new Mail();

      mail->AddItem(1001, 2001);

      mail->AddItem(1002, 2002);

      mail->AddItem(1003, 2003);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only stores references to items in the mail. It does not perform
    any item creation or deletion operations. The actual item must already exist in
    the database for the mail to be valid. This method is typically called during
    mail creation or modification processes within the game server.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid and correspond to existing items
    in the database; otherwise, the mail may contain invalid references. Do not call
    this method without proper initialization of the Mail object.
