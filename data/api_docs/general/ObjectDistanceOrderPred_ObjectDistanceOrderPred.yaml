  class: ObjectDistanceOrderPred
  method: ObjectDistanceOrderPred
  signature: void ObjectDistanceOrderPred::ObjectDistanceOrderPred(const WorldObject
    * refObj, bool ascending)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a distance ordering predicate for objects relative to a reference
    object.
  description: The ObjectDistanceOrderPred constructor initializes a predicate object
    used to compare and order WorldObject instances based on their distance from a
    specified reference object. This predicate is commonly used in sorting operations
    where objects need to be arranged by proximity to a given location or entity.
    The ascending parameter determines whether the ordering should be from nearest
    to farthest (true) or farthest to nearest (false). This functionality is essential
    for various game mechanics such as targeting, loot distribution, and NPC behavior
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: refObj
    description: Pointer to the reference WorldObject used as the basis for distance
      calculations. All comparisons will be made relative to this object's position
      in the world.
  - name: ascending
    description: Boolean flag that controls the sort order. If true, objects are ordered
      from nearest to farthest; if false, from farthest to nearest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Distance Predicate for Sorting
    code: 'WorldObject* player = ...;

      ObjectDistanceOrderPred distancePred(player, true);

      // Can now be used with std::sort or similar algorithms to order objects by
      distance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Predicate in a Sorting Context
    code: 'std::vector<WorldObject*> nearbyObjects;

      // ... populate vector with objects

      WorldObject* reference = player;

      ObjectDistanceOrderPred pred(reference, false); // Farthest first

      std::sort(nearbyObjects.begin(), nearbyObjects.end(), pred);

      // Objects now sorted from farthest to nearest'
    language: cpp
  notes: This predicate is typically used in conjunction with standard STL algorithms
    like std::sort or std::partial_sort. The reference object must remain valid for
    the lifetime of the predicate, as it's stored as a pointer and not copied. Performance
    is optimized for frequent comparisons by caching the reference object's position.
  warnings: Do not use this predicate with null reference objects as it will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the reference object remains
    in the game world during sorting operations to maintain valid position data.
