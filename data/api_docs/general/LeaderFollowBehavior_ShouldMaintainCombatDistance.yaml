  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: ShouldMaintainCombatDistance
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::ShouldMaintainCombatDistance(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should maintain a specific combat distance from
    its leader.
  description: The ShouldMaintainCombatDistance method evaluates if the AI-controlled
    bot should keep a certain distance from its leader during combat situations. This
    behavior is typically used in group scenarios where the bot needs to follow the
    leader while maintaining an optimal positioning for melee or ranged attacks. The
    decision is based on factors such as the bot's class, current combat state, and
    the distance between the bot and its leader. This method is part of the LeaderFollowBehavior
    class which manages follower AI behaviors in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should maintain combat distance from the leader;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the bot's AI should
    adjust its movement to preserve a safe or optimal distance during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->ShouldMaintainCombatDistance(playerBot)) {\n\
      \    // Adjust bot's movement to maintain distance\n    bot->SetMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_RUN_BACK);\n\
      } else {\n    // Allow bot to close distance or engage directly\n    bot->SetMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_FORWARD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void BotCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (leaderFollowBehavior->ShouldMaintainCombatDistance(playerBot))\
      \ {\n        // Maintain distance logic\n        if (GetDistanceToLeader() <\
      \ MIN_COMBAT_DISTANCE) {\n            MoveAwayFromLeader();\n        }\n   \
      \ } else {\n        // Close to leader, engage combat\n        AttackTargetIfReady();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers the bot's class abilities and weapon type when
    making decisions. For example, melee classes may have different distance requirements
    compared to ranged classes. The implementation might also factor in the leader's
    current combat state and target positioning.
  warnings: The method assumes that the bot has a valid leader assigned. Calling this
    method without proper initialization of the leader reference may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect decisions. Ensure that the playerBot parameter is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
