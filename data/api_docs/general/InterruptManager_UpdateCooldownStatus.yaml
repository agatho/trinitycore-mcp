  class: InterruptManager
  method: UpdateCooldownStatus
  signature: void InterruptManager::UpdateCooldownStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown status for all active interrupts within the manager.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStatus method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with interrupt abilities or effects in the game.
    It iterates through all registered interrupts, checks their current cooldown state,
    and updates internal tracking to reflect whether they are ready for use or still
    on cooldown. This method typically gets called during game ticks or when specific
    events occur that might affect interrupt availability. The implementation ensures
    proper synchronization of cooldown states across the game world and maintains
    consistency with player actions and spell mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    interruptManager.UpdateCooldownStatus();\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Handling
    code: "void Player::HandleSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if (spellInfo->HasAttribute(SPELL_ATTR0_INTERRUPTABLE))\n\
      \    {\n        interruptManager.UpdateCooldownStatus();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure accurate
    cooldown tracking. It's designed to be efficient and avoid blocking operations,
    making it suitable for frequent execution without performance impact.
