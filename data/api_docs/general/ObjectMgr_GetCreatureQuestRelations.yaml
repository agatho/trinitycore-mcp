documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all quest relations associated with a specific creature entry.
  description: The GetCreatureQuestRelations method fetches all quest relationships
    for a given creature entry from the database. This includes both quests that are
    offered by the creature (questgiver) and those that are required to be completed
    or rewarded by the creature. The returned QuestRelationResult typically contains
    a list of quest identifiers that are linked to the specified creature. This functionality
    is essential for proper quest handling in World of Warcraft, particularly when
    determining which quests a creature can initiate or conclude. The method operates
    on the object manager's internal data structures and does not modify any persistent
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestRelationResult containing all quest identifiers related to the specified
    creature entry. This usually represents a collection of quest IDs that are either
    offered by or tied to the creature in question.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate over creature quest relations
    code: "QuestRelationResult relations = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureQuestRelations(12345);\n\
      for (auto& relation : relations)\n{\n    uint32 questId = relation.questId;\n\
      \    // Process each quest ID related to creature 12345\n    printf(\"Creature\
      \ 12345 is related to quest %u\\n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal database caching and may return stale data
    if the underlying quest/creature relationship tables have been modified without
    a proper reload. It's recommended to ensure that quest data is fully loaded before
    calling this method in critical gameplay paths.
