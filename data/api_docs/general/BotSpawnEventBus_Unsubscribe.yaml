  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::Unsubscribe(HandlerId handlerId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a previously subscribed event handler from the bot spawn event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes an event handler that was previously
    registered with the BotSpawnEventBus using the Subscribe method. This method takes
    a HandlerId parameter which uniquely identifies the handler to be removed. Once
    unsubscribed, the handler will no longer receive notifications when bot spawn
    events occur. The method performs no validation on the provided HandlerId, so
    calling it with an invalid or already-unsubscribed handler ID may result in undefined
    behavior. This is typically used to clean up event handlers when they are no longer
    needed, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper event handling lifecycle management.
  parameters:
  - name: handlerId
    description: The unique identifier of the event handler to be removed from the
      bot spawn event bus. This ID should have been previously returned by a successful
      Subscribe call.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: "BotSpawnEventBus& eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();\nHandlerId id\
      \ = eventBus.Subscribe([](Bot* bot) {\n    // Handle bot spawn\n});\n// ...\
      \ some time later ...\neventBus.Unsubscribe(id);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribing in Cleanup Routine
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void RemoveBot(Bot* bot) {\n        //\
      \ Unsubscribe from events before removing the bot\n        eventBus_.Unsubscribe(handlerId_);\n\
      \        // Proceed with bot removal logic\n    }\nprivate:\n    BotSpawnEventBus&\
      \ eventBus_ = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();\n    HandlerId handlerId_;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The BotSpawnEventBus is designed to be thread-safe for subscription operations,
    but the Unsubscribe method should ideally be called from the same thread that
    performed the Subscribe operation to avoid potential race conditions. The HandlerId
    should be treated as an opaque identifier and not assumed to have any particular
    structure or meaning outside of the event bus context.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with an invalid HandlerId can lead to undefined behavior,
    including potential crashes or memory corruption. Always ensure that the HandlerId
    was obtained from a successful Subscribe call before attempting to unsubscribe.
    Repeatedly unsubscribing the same handler ID may cause issues if not properly
    managed.
