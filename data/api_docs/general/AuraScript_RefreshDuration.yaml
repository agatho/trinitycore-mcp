  method: RefreshDuration
  signature: void AuraScript::RefreshDuration()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the duration timer of the aura, extending its active time.
  description: The RefreshDuration method resets the remaining duration of the aura,
    effectively prolonging its active state. This is commonly used in aura scripts
    to extend the duration of an effect when certain conditions are met, such as applying
    a buff or debuff that should refresh rather than expire. The method does not alter
    the aura's properties or effects, only its time-based expiration. It is typically
    invoked within aura application or update handlers to dynamically manage aura
    lifespans.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Refresh Example
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        // Extend\
      \ aura duration when applied\n        RefreshDuration();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Duration Refresh
    code: "class HealingAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPeriodic(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect) override\n    {\n        if (GetUnitOwner()->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30)\n        {\n            // Refresh duration when health drops below\
      \ 30%\n            RefreshDuration();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an AuraScript context. It modifies
    the aura's internal timer but does not trigger any additional events or callbacks.
    The aura must still be active and valid for this call to have an effect.
  warnings: Calling RefreshDuration on a non-active or expired aura will not produce
    any visible effect. Ensure that the aura is still valid before calling this method,
    especially when used in periodic or application handlers.
