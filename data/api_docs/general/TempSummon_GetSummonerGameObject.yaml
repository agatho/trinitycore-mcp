  method: GetSummonerGameObject
  signature: int * TempSummon::GetSummonerGameObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the summoner's game object GUID if the temporary summon
    was created by a game object.
  description: The GetSummonerGameObject method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the game object that summoned this temporary summon. This is typically used
    when a creature or NPC is summoned by a game object such as a spell focus, trap,
    or other interactive environment element. The returned pointer points to an integer
    value representing the GUID of the summoning game object. If the summon was not
    created by a game object (e.g., it was summoned directly by a player or spell),
    this method will return nullptr. This functionality is essential for tracking
    summoner relationships in TrinityCore's creature and summon management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the summoning game object,
    or nullptr if the summon was not created by a game object.
  examples:
  - title: Check if summon was created by a game object
    code: "TempSummon* summon = ...;\nint* summonerGO = summon->GetSummonerGameObject();\n\
      if (summonerGO != nullptr)\n{\n    uint32 goGUID = *summonerGO;\n    // Use\
      \ the GUID to find the game object\n    GameObject* go = summon->GetMap()->GetGameObject(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::GameObject,\
      \ goGUID));\n    if (go)\n    {\n        // Process the summoning game object\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Summoned by GameObject: %u\", goGUID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TempSummon class hierarchy and relies on internal
    tracking of summoner relationships. The returned pointer is valid only while the
    summon exists and should not be stored for later use without proper validation.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be nullptr, so always check for null before dereferencing.
    Also, be aware that the GUID value pointed to might not be immediately valid if
    the game object has been destroyed or despawned.
