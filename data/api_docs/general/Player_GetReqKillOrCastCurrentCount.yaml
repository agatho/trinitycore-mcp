documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current kill or cast count for a specified quest requirement.
  description: This method returns the current progress count for a specific quest
    requirement, either a kill or cast, based on the provided quest ID and entry.
    It is commonly used in quest system mechanics to determine how close a player
    is to completing a quest objective. The method operates within the context of
    the player's quest log and can be used to check progress toward completing quest
    objectives that involve killing creatures or using items. This functionality is
    essential for implementing quest completion logic and tracking player progress.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the kill/cast count
      is being retrieved. This parameter identifies which quest's progress should
      be checked.
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the creature or item involved in the quest requirement.
      This parameter specifies what specific requirement to check progress for, such
      as a particular creature kill or item use.
  returns: Returns the current count value representing how many times the player
    has completed the specified quest requirement. The value is typically between
    0 and 1000, depending on the quest's requirements and the player's progress. If
    no progress exists for the specified requirement, it returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint16 count = player->GetReqKillOrCastCurrentCount(12345, 6789);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "uint16 count = player->GetReqKillOrCastCurrentCount(questId, entry); //\
      \ where questId and entry are variables from a quest system\nif (count < 10)\
      \ {\n    // Handle incomplete quest progress\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and should be used
    carefully when implementing quest logic. It's typically called during quest update
    events or when checking player progress for specific objectives. Performance considerations
    are minimal, but this method may be called frequently during quest updates.
  warnings: The method might return zero if no progress exists for the specified quest
    requirement, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about quest completion
    status. Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    quest-related methods to avoid misinterpretation of player progress.
