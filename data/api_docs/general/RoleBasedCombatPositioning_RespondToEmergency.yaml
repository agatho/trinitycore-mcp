  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: RespondToEmergency
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::RespondToEmergency(Player * bot, const
    int & safeZone)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the specified bot player to a safe zone in response to an emergency
    situation.
  description: The RespondToEmergency method is designed to handle emergency scenarios
    within the RoleBasedCombatPositioning system. When invoked, it instructs the given
    bot player to immediately relocate to a designated safe zone, typically to avoid
    imminent danger or to reposition for tactical advantage. This method is part of
    the AI behavior system that dynamically adjusts player positioning based on combat
    roles and situational awareness. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the bot's current position and state within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to respond
      to the emergency. This parameter must be a valid player instance; passing nullptr
      will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: safeZone
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the identifier or index
      of the safe zone the bot should move to. The specific mapping of safe zones
      is determined by the game's internal configuration and AI logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Response
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioningSystem;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player

      int safeZoneId = 3;

      positioningSystem.RespondToEmergency(myBot, safeZoneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat or high-risk scenarios where
    immediate repositioning is necessary. It assumes that the bot has been properly
    initialized and has access to the necessary AI modules for movement and positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the safeZone parameter refers to a valid zone within the game
    world; otherwise, the bot may attempt to move to an invalid location or fail to
    respond correctly to the emergency.
