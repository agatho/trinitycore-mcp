documentation:
  brief: Adds a transmogrification set to the player's collection.
  description: The AddTransmogSet method adds a specified transmogrification set to
    the player's collection in TrinityCore. This method is typically used to grant
    access to a specific set of transmogrification items, allowing the player to apply
    those items as cosmetic transformations on their gear. The method operates on
    the CollectionMgr instance, which manages the player's collected transmog data.
    It does not validate whether the set ID is valid or exists in the database; it
    simply adds the set to the collection without checking for duplicates or item
    availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Add a Transmog Set to Player Collection
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->AddTransmogSet(12345); // Adds transmog set with ID 12345 to
      the player''s collection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's collection data. It is typically
    called during quest completion, item acquisition, or other game events that grant
    access to new transmog sets. The method assumes that the provided set ID is valid
    and exists in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent set ID may lead to
    undefined behavior or errors in the client-side UI when the player attempts to
    use the set. Ensure proper validation of set IDs before calling this method.
