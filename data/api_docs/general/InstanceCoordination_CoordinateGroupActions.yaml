  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupActions(Group * group, const
    std::string & action)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates actions for a group within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateGroupActions method manages and synchronizes group-based
    actions within a World of Warcraft instance. It ensures that all members of a
    specified group perform consistent actions according to the provided action string.
    This method is typically used in dungeon, raid, or scenario instances where coordinated
    behavior among group members is required for quest progression, event handling,
    or combat mechanics. The method operates on the group's current instance context
    and may trigger various internal systems such as loot distribution, achievement
    tracking, or instance-specific event triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which actions are being coordinated.
      Must be a valid group with members; null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: action
    description: String identifier representing the action to coordinate across the
      group. Valid values depend on instance type and game mechanics, such as 'loot',
      'engage', or 'complete'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Action Coordination
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupActions(myGroup,\
      \ \"loot\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Instance-Specific Action Coordination
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && player->GetMap()->IsRaid())\n\
      {\n    InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupActions(raidGroup, \"engage_boss\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe within the context of TrinityCore's
    instance management system. It relies on the group's current instance context
    and will not perform any action if the group is not associated with a valid instance.
    The implementation may involve internal synchronization mechanisms to ensure consistent
    state across all group members.
  warnings: Passing a null group pointer or an invalid action string may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group exists and has members before
    calling this method. Additionally, this method should not be called outside of
    instance contexts where group coordination is meaningful.
