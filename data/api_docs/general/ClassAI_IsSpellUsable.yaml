  signature: bool ClassAI::IsSpellUsable(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified spell is usable by the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The IsSpellUsable method determines whether a given spell can be cast
    by the AI-controlled unit at the current moment. It evaluates various conditions
    such as spell cooldowns, mana requirements, target validity, and AI-specific restrictions.
    This method is typically used within AI decision-making logic to filter out spells
    that are not currently available for casting. The method returns true if the spell
    meets all usability criteria, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check for usability. This should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is usable by the AI unit, false otherwise.
    A spell may be deemed unusable due to cooldowns, insufficient mana, invalid targets,
    or other AI-specific constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Usability Check
    code: "if (ai->IsSpellUsable(12345)) {\n    // Cast the spell\n    ai->DoCastVictim(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Decision Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public ClassAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (me->GetVictim()) {\n            // Check multiple\
      \ spells for usability\n            if (IsSpellUsable(12345)) {\n          \
      \      DoCastVictim(12345);\n            } else if (IsSpellUsable(12346)) {\n\
      \                DoCastVictim(12346);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks that mirror the client-side spell usability logic,
    ensuring consistency between AI behavior and player expectations. It does not
    perform actual spell casting but only evaluates whether a spell can be cast under
    current conditions.
