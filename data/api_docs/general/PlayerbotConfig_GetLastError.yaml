  method: GetLastError
  signature: std::string PlayerbotConfig::GetLastError() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the last error message that occurred within the player bot configuration
    system
  description: The GetLastError method returns the most recently recorded error message
    from the PlayerbotConfig class. This method is typically used to diagnose issues
    with player bot configuration loading, parsing, or validation. The returned string
    contains descriptive information about what went wrong during the last operation
    that resulted in an error state. This functionality is essential for debugging
    and logging purposes within the TrinityCore player bot system, allowing developers
    and administrators to understand why certain configurations failed to load or
    apply correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the descriptive error message of the last encountered
    error, or an empty string if no errors have occurred since the last reset or initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Retrieval
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\n// ... some configuration operations that may\
      \ fail ...\nstd::string lastError = config.GetLastError();\nif (!lastError.empty())\
      \ {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Configuration error: {}\", lastError);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after a configuration operation
    that might have failed to capture the specific error. The error state is typically
    cleared automatically when a successful operation occurs, but calling this method
    repeatedly will return the same error until a new error occurs or the configuration
    is reset.
  warnings: Be aware that calling GetLastError() does not clear the error state -
    subsequent calls will continue to return the same error message until a new error
    occurs. This can lead to confusion if not properly managed in error handling code.
