  class: FollowerAI
  method: JustReachedHome
  signature: void FollowerAI::JustReachedHome()
documentation:
  brief: Called when a follower AI unit reaches its home position after being moved
    or summoned.
  description: The JustReachedHome method is invoked in the FollowerAI class when
    a creature that is following a player has successfully returned to its designated
    home location. This typically occurs after the creature has been summoned, moved
    via teleportation, or otherwise relocated from its original spawn point. The method
    serves as a callback for custom behavior when the follower returns to its home
    position, allowing developers to implement specific actions such as resetting
    AI states, triggering events, or initiating dialogue sequences. It is part of
    the core AI framework in TrinityCore and is used primarily for managing NPC behavior
    related to following and returning to fixed positions.

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyFollower : public FollowerAI {\npublic:\n    void JustReachedHome()\
      \ override {\n        // Custom logic when follower returns home\n        Talk(0);\n\
      \        SetCombatMode(false);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after a creature's movement to its home position
    completes. It should not be used for initiating new movements or actions that
    might interfere with the AI state machine. The method may be invoked multiple
    times during an NPC's lifetime if it returns home repeatedly.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it can block the AI
    update cycle. Do not call SetFollower() or similar methods inside this function
    unless absolutely necessary, as it may cause recursion or unexpected behavior.
