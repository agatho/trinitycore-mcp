  signature: bool Unit::IsWalking() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently walking.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is in a
    walking state, which is distinct from running or swimming. It returns true when
    the unit's movement speed is set to walking mode and false otherwise. The method
    is commonly used in game mechanics to determine the current movement state of
    units, particularly for handling movement-related events or actions that require
    specific movement modes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is walking, false otherwise. This indicates that
    the unit's movement speed has been set to walking mode rather than running or
    swimming.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsWalking())\n{\n    // Do something\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Do something\
      \ else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the unit's movement state being properly set. It does
    not directly check for movement animations or visual effects, but rather checks
    whether the unit is in walking mode according to its internal movement settings.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    movement-related functions, as it may conflict with certain movement updates or
    states that are managed by TrinityCore's movement system.
