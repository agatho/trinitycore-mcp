  class: MemberLeftHandler
  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool MemberLeftHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a group member left event and returns whether the event was handled
    successfully.
  description: The HandleEvent method in the MemberLeftHandler class is responsible
    for processing group-related events when a player leaves a group. This method
    typically handles cleanup operations, updates group state, and ensures that other
    group members are notified of the departure. It integrates with TrinityCore's
    group management system to maintain consistency in group data structures and player
    status tracking. The method returns true if the event was processed successfully,
    or false if there were issues during handling.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a GroupEvent object containing details about
      the member left event, including the player GUID, group ID, and other relevant
      metadata.
  returns: Returns true if the group member left event was successfully processed
    and handled; returns false if an error occurred during processing or if the event
    could not be properly managed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleEvent
    code: "GroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::MEMBER_LEFT;\nevent.playerGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nevent.groupId = 67890;\nMemberLeftHandler handler;\nbool result\
      \ = handler.HandleEvent(event);\nif (result) {\n    // Event handled successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the group system when a player leaves
    a group, either through explicit leave command or automatic removal due to zoning
    or disconnection. It's important that this method does not perform any blocking
    operations as it may be called from different threads within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid GroupEvent data, as it could
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required fields in the
    GroupEvent are properly initialized before passing it to this method.
