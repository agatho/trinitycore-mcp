  class: TargetSelector
  method: SelectStrongestTarget
  signature: SelectionResult TargetSelector::SelectStrongestTarget(float maxRange,
    TargetValidation validation)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the strongest target within the specified range based on validation
    criteria.
  description: The SelectStrongestTarget method identifies and returns the most threatening
    or powerful enemy target within a given maximum range. It evaluates potential
    targets using predefined validation rules to ensure only valid candidates are
    considered. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes for
    mobs or NPCs to determine their primary attack target. The selection process considers
    factors such as threat level, distance, and target validity according to the provided
    validation function.
  parameters:
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which targets will be considered
      for selection.
  - name: validation
    description: Function or criteria used to validate whether a target is eligible
      for selection.
  returns: Returns a SelectionResult object containing the selected target, or an
    invalid result if no suitable target was found within range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: SelectionResult result = selector.SelectStrongestTarget(30.0f, TargetValidation::Hostile);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Validation
    code: "auto customValidation = [](Unit* target) -> bool {\n    return target->IsAlive()\
      \ && !target->HasAura(12345);\n};\nSelectionResult result = selector.SelectStrongestTarget(25.0f,\
      \ customValidation);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all valid targets within range,
    so performance may degrade with many nearby enemies. The validation function should
    be lightweight to avoid impacting AI responsiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that the validation criteria do not inadvertently exclude valid
    targets due to overly restrictive conditions. Be cautious when using dynamic target
    validation as it can lead to inconsistent targeting behavior.
