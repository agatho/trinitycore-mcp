  brief: Removes a specific item from the player's inventory.
  description: The RemoveMItem method removes a specified item from the player's inventory,
    typically used for removing items that are no longer needed or when a player is
    no longer able to use an item. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    where items need to be removed from the player's inventory, such as during quest
    completion or when items are consumed. The method returns true if the item was
    successfully removed and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The item ID of the item to be removed from the player's inventory.
      This represents the unique identifier for the specific item being removed.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully removed from the player's inventory,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      bool success = player->RemoveMItem(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory management
    methods and may be called during quest completion or item consumption events.
    It's important to note that this method does not remove items from the player's
    bag slots directly, but rather removes them from the player's inventory.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the item ID is known and valid. Using
    invalid item IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors in the game system.
