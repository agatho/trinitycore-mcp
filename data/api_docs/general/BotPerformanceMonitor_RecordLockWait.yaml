  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordLockWait
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordLockWait(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records a lock wait duration for performance monitoring in the bot system
  description: The RecordLockWait method logs the time a bot spent waiting for a lock
    acquisition, typically used to monitor thread contention and performance bottlenecks
    within the TrinityCore bot subsystem. This method is part of the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class which tracks various performance metrics related to AI behavior and resource
    usage. The recorded microseconds value helps identify potential threading issues
    or inefficient locking mechanisms in bot operations.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The duration of time (in microseconds) that a bot spent waiting for
      a lock to be acquired. This value should be a positive integer representing
      the actual wait time measured during lock contention.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint64 waitTime = 5000; // 5 milliseconds

      monitor.RecordLockWait(waitTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Lock Timing
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor* perfMonitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance();\n\
      uint64 startTime = getTickCount();\n// Simulate lock acquisition attempt\nif\
      \ (lock.TryAcquire()) {\n    uint64 waitTime = getTickCount() - startTime;\n\
      \    perfMonitor->RecordLockWait(waitTime);\n    // Proceed with locked operation\n\
      \    lock.Release();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within bot AI logic or thread synchronization
    code. The recorded data may be used for profiling, debugging, or performance optimization
    purposes. It's important to ensure that the microseconds parameter represents
    actual wait time and not total execution time.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method with negative values as it could skew performance
    statistics. Ensure proper timing measurement before calling this method to avoid
    including unrelated delays in the recorded wait times.
