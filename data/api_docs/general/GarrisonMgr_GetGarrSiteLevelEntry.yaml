  class: GarrisonMgr
  method: GetGarrSiteLevelEntry
  signature: const GarrSiteLevelEntry * GarrisonMgr::GetGarrSiteLevelEntry(uint32
    garrSiteId, uint32 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Garrison Site Level entry for a specified garrison site and
    level.
  description: The GetGarrSiteLevelEntry method fetches the GarrSiteLevelEntry object
    that corresponds to a given garrison site identifier and level. This entry contains
    configuration data such as the maximum number of followers, building slots, and
    other garrison-specific properties that define how a garrison behaves at a particular
    level. The method is typically used during garrison initialization or when determining
    garrison capabilities based on its current level. It performs a lookup in internal
    garrison data structures and returns a pointer to the corresponding entry, or
    nullptr if no matching entry is found.
  parameters:
  - name: garrSiteId
    description: The unique identifier for the garrison site. This ID corresponds
      to the GarrSite.db2 file entries which define different types of garrisons (e.g.,
      Alliance or Horde garrison types).
  - name: level
    description: The level of the garrison for which to retrieve the site level entry.
      Valid levels are typically between 1 and the maximum supported garrison level
      in the game.
  returns: A pointer to a const GarrSiteLevelEntry object that defines the properties
    of the garrison at the specified level, or nullptr if no matching entry exists
    for the given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve garrison site level data
    code: "const GarrSiteLevelEntry* entry = sGarrisonMgr->GetGarrSiteLevelEntry(1234,\
      \ 5);\nif (entry)\n{\n    // Use entry->MaxFollowers or other properties\n \
      \   printf(\"Max Followers: %u\\n\", entry->MaxFollowers);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the internal garrison data structures and
    is expected to be fast. It should only be called after the garrison system has
    been initialized, otherwise it may return nullptr even for valid inputs.
  warnings: Ensure that both garrSiteId and level are valid before calling this function;
    invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. The returned
    pointer is const and must not be modified.
