  class: DemonologyWarlockRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void DemonologyWarlockRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the demonology warlock's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core combat logic
    for a demonology warlock class in TrinityCore. It evaluates the current state
    of the player and their target to determine the optimal sequence of spells and
    abilities to cast. This method typically manages the use of key abilities such
    as Shadow Bolt, Hand of Gul'dan, and other rotation-specific spells while considering
    cooldowns, resource management (such as soul shards), and combat efficiency. The
    method is designed to be called during the AI's update cycle when targeting a
    single enemy. It assumes that a valid target has been set and that the player
    is in combat mode.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which unit the rotation should be executed
      against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and should only be invoked
    when the warlock is actively engaged in combat with a valid target. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore being used, as spell
    priorities and mechanics can change between patches.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    unit before calling. Passing an invalid or null target may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes within the AI system.
