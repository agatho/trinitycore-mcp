  signature: const int & CollectionMgr::GetWarbandScenes() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal storage of warband scenes associated
    with the collection manager.
  description: The GetWarbandScenes method retrieves a constant reference to an integer
    value representing the collection of warband scenes managed by the CollectionMgr
    instance. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to access scene data related to warbands, which are groups of players participating
    in specific game events or content. The returned reference points to internal
    storage and should not be modified directly. The method does not perform any computations
    or data retrieval beyond returning the stored value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the identifier or index
    of warband scenes within the collection manager's internal data structure. This
    value typically corresponds to a specific scene configuration or set of scenes
    related to warband activities in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Warband Scenes Identifier
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = sCollectionMgr;

      const int& warbandScenes = mgr->GetWarbandScenes();

      std::cout << "Warband scenes ID: " << warbandScenes << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, ensuring that the returned value cannot
    be modified through this interface. The underlying integer may represent an index,
    identifier, or configuration value related to warband scenes in the game's scene
    management system.
