  method: OnRemove
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::OnRemove()
documentation:
  brief: Called when an area trigger is removed from the world, allowing cleanup of
    associated AI behavior.
  description: The OnRemove method is invoked when an AreaTriggerAI instance is destroyed
    or removed from the game world. This method serves as a cleanup hook for any resources
    or state that were initialized during the area trigger's lifetime. It is typically
    called by the TrinityCore framework when the area trigger expires, is manually
    removed, or when the associated GameObject or Unit is destroyed. Developers can
    override this method to perform necessary cleanup operations such as releasing
    references, canceling scheduled events, or notifying other systems about the trigger's
    removal.

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyAreaTriggerAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : AreaTriggerAI(go) {}\n    \n    void OnRemove() override\n    {\n  \
      \      // Perform cleanup operations here\n        if (myTimer)\n          \
      \  CancelEvent(myTimer);\n        \n        AreaTriggerAI::OnRemove();\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the destruction phase of an area trigger's lifecycle.
    It should not be used to perform operations that require the area trigger to still
    be active in the world, as it may have already been removed from the game state.
