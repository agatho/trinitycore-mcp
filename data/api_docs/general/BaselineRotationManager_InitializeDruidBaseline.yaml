  method: InitializeDruidBaseline
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializeDruidBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline Druid rotation behavior for the player's current
    specialization and gear setup.
  description: The InitializeDruidBaseline method sets up the foundational rotation
    logic for Druid characters within the TrinityCore AI system. This method configures
    the baseline abilities, cooldowns, and priority rules that govern how a Druid
    should act during combat based on their current form (Cat, Bear, Moonkin, etc.)
    and equipped gear. It establishes default spell priorities, resource management
    strategies, and situational awareness parameters necessary for optimal gameplay
    performance. The method is typically invoked during character initialization or
    when switching between different Druid specializations to ensure the AI has accurate
    baseline behavior.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeDruidBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the player's Druid class and specialization
    are fully initialized but before any combat decisions are made. It does not account
    for dynamic changes in gear or buffs during gameplay; those would typically be
    handled by separate update methods.
