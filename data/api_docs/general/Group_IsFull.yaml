  method: IsFull
  signature: bool Group::IsFull() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the group has reached its maximum player capacity.
  description: The IsFull method determines if the current group has achieved its
    maximum allowed number of members. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, groups
    have a fixed size limit based on the game mode (normal groups have 5 players,
    raid groups have 40 players). This method is commonly used to prevent adding new
    members to a full group and to manage group composition during player interactions
    such as joining or inviting others. The check considers all active group members
    including the leader.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group has reached its maximum capacity, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group is Full Before Inviting
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && !group->IsFull()) {\n\
      \    // Invite new player\n    group->AddMember(newPlayer);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Notify player that group is full\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Group is\
      \ full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group size tracking mechanism and does
    not account for temporary disconnections or pending invitations. It's typically
    used in conjunction with other group management functions to ensure proper group
    state handling.
