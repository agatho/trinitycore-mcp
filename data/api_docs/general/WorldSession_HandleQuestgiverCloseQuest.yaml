documentation:
  brief: Handles the client's request to close a quest giver window, finalizing quest
    interaction.
  description: The HandleQuestgiverCloseQuest method processes the client's signal
    to close a quest giver dialog window. This typically occurs when a player finishes
    interacting with an NPC quest giver and wishes to dismiss the quest interface.
    The method ensures proper cleanup of quest-related state and may trigger any final
    quest completion logic or notifications. It is part of the core quest handling
    system in TrinityCore, managing the transition from active quest interaction back
    to normal gameplay state.

  - title: Basic usage in quest handling flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestgiverCloseQuest(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestGiverCloseQuest\
      \ & questGiverCloseQuest)\n{\n    // Client has closed the quest giver window\n\
      \    // Perform cleanup and finalize any pending quest actions\n    _player->GetQuestInterface()->ClearQuestGiver();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the client when closing
    a quest dialog. It should not be called directly from other systems unless simulating
    client behavior. The method assumes that proper quest state management has been
    maintained throughout the interaction.
