  method: LootObject
  signature: bool LootStrategy::LootObject(BotAI * ai, int objectGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to loot an object using the bot's AI and returns true if successful.
  description: The LootObject method is responsible for initiating the looting process
    for a specified game object within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a BotAI
    instance and an object GUID as parameters, and attempts to perform the looting
    action based on the bot's current strategy and state. The method evaluates whether
    the bot can loot the object, considering factors such as proximity, looting rules,
    and inventory capacity. This function is typically used in automated bot behavior
    systems where bots need to automatically collect items from containers, corpses,
    or other interactive objects in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot's behavior and
      decision-making process during looting operations.
  - name: objectGuid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the game
      object to be looted. This GUID must correspond to a valid interactable object
      in the game world such as a corpse, chest, or container.
  returns: Returns true if the looting operation was successfully initiated and completed
    for the specified object; otherwise returns false if the operation failed due
    to invalid parameters, object unavailability, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot object usage
    code: "if (strategy->LootObject(ai, 12345)) {\n    // Successfully looted object\
      \ with GUID 12345\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"Successfully looted item.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Failed to loot object\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"Failed to loot item.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot object with error handling
    code: "uint32 targetGuid = GetNearbyCorpseGuid();\nif (targetGuid > 0) {\n   \
      \ if (strategy->LootObject(ai, targetGuid)) {\n        ai->TellPlayer(\"Looted\
      \ corpse successfully.\");\n    } else {\n        ai->TellPlayer(\"Could not\
      \ loot corpse.\");\n    }\n} else {\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"No nearby corpses\
      \ to loot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly initialized
    and configured with appropriate looting strategies. The object GUID must be valid
    and correspond to an actual object in the game world. Performance-wise, this method
    may block briefly while processing the looting logic, especially if multiple items
    are involved.
  warnings: Ensure that the objectGuid parameter refers to a valid, accessible object
    before calling this method. Calling with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or errors in the AI system. This method should not be called
    from within critical sections of code where thread safety is required.
