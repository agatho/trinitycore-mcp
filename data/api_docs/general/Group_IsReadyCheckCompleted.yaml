documentation:
  brief: Determines whether all group members have completed their ready check
  description: The IsReadyCheckCompleted method checks if all players in the group
    have responded to the current ready check. A ready check is initiated when a group
    leader or raid leader uses the /readycheck command, which prompts each group member
    to confirm they are ready for an activity such as entering a dungeon or starting
    a raid. This method returns true only after every player in the group has either
    confirmed their readiness or timed out. The method does not reset the ready check
    state; it simply reports the current status of the check.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all group members have completed their ready check (either
    by confirming or timing out), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Ready Check is Complete
    code: "if (group->IsReadyCheckCompleted()) {\n    // All players have responded\
      \ to the ready check\n    ChatHandler(ch).SendSysMessage(\"All players are ready!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Some players haven't responded yet\n    ChatHandler(ch).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Waiting for players to respond...\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Group::SendReadyCheck()
    to manage group readiness states. The ready check state is maintained internally
    by the Group class and automatically resets after a new ready check is initiated
    or when all players have responded.
