  brief: Initializes an Area of Effect zone for spell or ability targeting
  description: The AoEZone constructor initializes a new area of effect zone object
    used in World of Warcraft's spell system. This method sets up the necessary parameters
    and data structures required for calculating and applying effects within a specified
    radius around a target location. The implementation handles the core functionality
    needed to define the zone's boundaries, affectable targets, and application logic
    for area-based spells or abilities. It is typically called internally by the spell
    system when processing area effect abilities.

  - title: Basic AoEZone Initialization
    code: 'AoEZone zone;

      zone.AoEZone(); // Initializes a new AOE zone with default parameters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically not called directly by developers but rather through
    the spell system's internal mechanisms. The constructor may initialize various
    internal state variables including target position, radius, and effect type. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple initialization method.
