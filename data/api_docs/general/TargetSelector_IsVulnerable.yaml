  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsVulnerable(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is vulnerable to specific attack types or
    effects.
  description: The IsVulnerable method evaluates whether a given target unit is currently
    in a vulnerable state, typically indicating that the unit can be more easily damaged
    or affected by certain abilities. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making
    processes to determine optimal targeting strategies for attacks or spells. The
    vulnerability check may consider factors such as current health status, defensive
    buffs, debuffs, or other game mechanics that affect a unit's resistance to damage
    or effects. The method returns true if the target is considered vulnerable according
    to internal logic, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is currently in a vulnerable state, making
    it more susceptible to attacks or effects; returns false if the target is not
    considered vulnerable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vulnerability Check
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsVulnerable(targetUnit)) {\n    // Target is vulnerable,\
      \ proceed with high-damage ability\n    unit->CastSpell(targetUnit, SPELL_HIGH_DAMAGE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Attack Selection
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsVulnerable(targetUnit)) {\n    // Use a spell that\
      \ is more effective against vulnerable targets\n    unit->CastSpell(targetUnit,\
      \ SPELL_VULNERABLE_DEBUFF, true);\n} else {\n    // Use standard attack or different\
      \ spell\n    unit->CastSpell(targetUnit, SPELL_STANDARD_ATTACK, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's combat system and may consider
    various debuff states, health thresholds, and game mechanics. It is typically
    used within AI logic to make tactical decisions about which targets to prioritize
    for attacks or effects.
