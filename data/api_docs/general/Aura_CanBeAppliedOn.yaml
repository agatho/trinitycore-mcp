  class: Aura
  method: CanBeAppliedOn
  signature: bool Aura::CanBeAppliedOn(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura can be applied to a specified target unit.
  description: The CanBeAppliedOn method checks if the current aura instance is eligible
    to be applied on a given target unit. This method evaluates various conditions
    such as target type, aura restrictions, and game mechanics rules that determine
    whether an aura can logically be cast or applied to a particular unit. It is typically
    used during aura application logic to prevent invalid or prohibited aura applications.
    The method considers factors like target faction, unit flags, immunity states,
    and other conditional requirements defined by the aura's properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura can be applied to the target unit; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false indicates that the aura application would be blocked
    due to target restrictions or other validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application Check
    code: "Aura* aura = ...;\nUnit* target = player;\nif (aura->CanBeAppliedOn(target))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with aura application\n    aura->ApplyToTarget(target);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid application attempt\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Cannot apply aura to this target.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core aura validation system in TrinityCore. It
    should be called before attempting to apply an aura to ensure compliance with
    game rules and prevent invalid states. The implementation may involve checking
    unit flags, faction relationships, immunity status, and other contextual factors.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for all aura application logic; additional
    checks such as spell casting requirements and cooldowns should also be considered.
    Improper use of this method in conditional logic could lead to unexpected behavior
    or exploits if validation is bypassed.
