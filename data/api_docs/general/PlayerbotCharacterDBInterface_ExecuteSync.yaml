  method: ExecuteSync
  signature: int PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::ExecuteSync(int * stmt)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a prepared database statement synchronously and returns the result
    code.
  description: The ExecuteSync method performs a synchronous execution of a previously
    prepared database statement within the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface context.
    This method is typically used in the TrinityCore playerbot system to handle database
    operations that require immediate execution and feedback. It ensures thread-safe
    access to character-specific database operations, particularly when managing bot-related
    data such as inventory, quests, or behavior settings. The method blocks until
    the statement completes, making it suitable for operations where immediate results
    are required before proceeding with subsequent logic.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing a prepared database statement
      handle. This parameter must point to a valid prepared statement that has been
      initialized through the appropriate database interface methods.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the database execution.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values usually
    represent various error conditions such as connection failures, syntax errors,
    or constraint violations. The exact meaning of specific return codes depends on
    the underlying database implementation and error handling within TrinityCore's
    playerbot system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int statementHandle = 0;\n// Assume statementHandle is initialized with\
      \ a valid prepared statement\nint result = characterDBInterface->ExecuteSync(&statementHandle);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Statement executed successfully\n    printf(\"Database\
      \ operation completed successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error based\
      \ on return code\n    printf(\"Database operation failed with code: %d\\n\"\
      , result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of
    code as it performs synchronous database operations which can block execution.
    The statement parameter must be a valid prepared statement handle, otherwise behavior
    is undefined. In playerbot systems, this method is commonly used for character
    state updates and data persistence operations.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteSync with an invalid or uninitialized statement pointer
    may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Since this is a synchronous operation,
    it can significantly impact performance if called frequently in tight loops. Always
    ensure proper error handling based on the returned integer value to maintain system
    stability.
