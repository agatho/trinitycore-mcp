  method: GenerateEssence
  signature: void EssenceManager::GenerateEssence(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates essence resources for the player or entity associated with the
    EssenceManager instance.
  description: The GenerateEssence method is responsible for creating and allocating
    essence resources within the game system. This method typically handles the internal
    logic of how essence is produced, whether through player actions, quest completion,
    or other in-game mechanics. It may update internal counters, trigger visual effects,
    or modify player attributes related to essence consumption or generation. The
    method operates on a predefined amount parameter that determines how much essence
    is generated. This function is commonly used in conjunction with other essence-related
    systems such as enchanting, item crafting, or class-specific abilities that require
    essence as a resource.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of essence to be generated. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the amount of essence units to create.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Generation
    code: 'EssenceManager* manager = player->GetEssenceManager();

      manager->GenerateEssence(100); // Generates 100 units of essence'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Essence Generation Based on Player Level
    code: 'EssenceManager* manager = player->GetEssenceManager();

      int level = player->GetLevel();

      int generatedAmount = level * 5;

      manager->GenerateEssence(generatedAmount); // Generates essence based on player
      level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called from various game systems including quest completion
    handlers, spell effects, or periodic resource regeneration. It is important to
    ensure that the amount parameter does not exceed system limits or cause overflow
    conditions in the essence tracking system.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value for amount may result in undefined
    behavior or system errors. Ensure proper validation of input parameters before
    invoking this function.
