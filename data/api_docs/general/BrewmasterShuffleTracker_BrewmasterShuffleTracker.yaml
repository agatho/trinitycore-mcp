  brief: Initializes a new BrewmasterShuffleTracker instance with default values.
  description: The BrewmasterShuffleTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the BrewmasterShuffleTracker class. This class is designed to track the shuffle
    mechanics associated with the Brewmaster monk ability in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    emulation. The constructor sets up internal state variables and prepares the tracker
    for monitoring shuffle events during combat. It ensures that all necessary data
    structures are properly initialized before the tracker begins its operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BrewmasterShuffleTracker instance
    code: 'BrewmasterShuffleTracker shuffleTracker;

      // The shuffleTracker is now initialized and ready to track shuffle events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not require any parameters and performs no complex
    initialization logic. It simply sets up the internal state of the tracker. Developers
    should be aware that this class likely interacts with other systems in the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly those related to monk abilities and combat mechanics.
