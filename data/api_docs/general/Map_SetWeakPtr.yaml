  class: Map
  method: SetWeakPtr
  signature: void Map::SetWeakPtr(int weakRef)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a weak reference pointer for the map instance, allowing for memory management
    and garbage collection.
  description: The SetWeakPtr method is used to establish a weak reference to the
    Map object, which enables proper memory management within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method allows the system to track when the map is no longer referenced by
    strong pointers, facilitating garbage collection and preventing memory leaks.
    It is particularly important in scenarios where multiple objects may reference
    the same map instance, ensuring that the map can be safely removed from memory
    when all strong references are gone. The weak reference helps maintain the integrity
    of the game world's memory management system.
  parameters:
  - name: weakRef
    description: An integer value representing the weak reference identifier for the
      map instance. This value typically corresponds to a specific index or identifier
      used by the framework's memory management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Weak Reference for Map
    code: 'Map* mapInstance = new Map();

      mapInstance->SetWeakPtr(42);

      // The map instance now has a weak reference of 42'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    object creation and memory management. It should be called after the map instance
    is created but before it's fully initialized, ensuring proper tracking of weak
    references.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by developers unless explicitly
    required by the framework's internal operations. Incorrect usage may lead to memory
    management issues or unexpected behavior in game world objects.
