  method: GetCluster
  signature: int BehaviorCluster::GetCluster(uint32_t clusterId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cluster identifier associated with the current behavior cluster
    instance.
  description: The GetCluster method is used to obtain the unique cluster identifier
    that defines the behavioral group or category this BehaviorCluster instance belongs
    to. This identifier is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine
    which set of behaviors, actions, or strategies should be applied to a given NPC
    or creature. The method does not take any parameters and returns an integer value
    representing the cluster ID. It's commonly employed within TrinityCore's AI framework
    to manage grouped behaviors for mobs, ensuring that creatures with similar roles
    or types follow consistent action patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the cluster identifier (clusterId) associated
    with this BehaviorCluster instance. A return value of -1 may indicate an invalid
    or uninitialized cluster state, while positive integers represent valid cluster
    IDs used for behavior grouping in the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve cluster ID
    code: "BehaviorCluster* cluster = ...;\nint clusterId = cluster->GetCluster();\n\
      if (clusterId >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with behavior logic based on cluster\
      \ ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Current cluster ID: %d\", clusterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when determining
    the appropriate action set for a creature. The returned cluster ID should be validated
    against known behavior clusters defined in the TrinityCore AI configuration to
    ensure proper behavior assignment. The method is marked as const, indicating it
    does not modify the internal state of the BehaviorCluster instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the BehaviorCluster instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as returning -1 may indicate an uninitialized or invalid
    state. Avoid using the returned cluster ID directly in conditional logic without
    proper validation, as unexpected values could lead to undefined behavior in AI
    decision making.
