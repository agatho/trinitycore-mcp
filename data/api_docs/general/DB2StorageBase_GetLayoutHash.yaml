  class: DB2StorageBase
  method: GetLayoutHash
  signature: uint32 DB2StorageBase::GetLayoutHash() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the hash value representing the data layout of the
    DB2 storage.
  description: The GetLayoutHash method computes a unique 32-bit hash value that represents
    the structural layout of the DB2 storage data. This hash is typically used to
    verify data consistency and compatibility, especially when loading or validating
    DB2 files. The method ensures that any changes in the data structure will result
    in a different hash value, making it useful for detecting schema mismatches or
    corrupted data. It operates on the internal layout information of the storage
    without requiring external data access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the computed hash of the DB2 storage
    layout. This value uniquely identifies the structure of the data fields and their
    arrangement within the storage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Verify Data Layout
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* storage = sDB2Manager->GetStorage("Creature");

      uint32 layoutHash = storage->GetLayoutHash();

      TC_LOG_INFO("sql.sql", "Creature DB2 layout hash: %u", layoutHash);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The hash calculation is based on internal field definitions and their order,
    not on actual data content. This method should be called after the storage has
    been properly initialized with its schema. The returned value remains constant
    for a given storage layout throughout the application lifecycle.
