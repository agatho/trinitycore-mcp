  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::DoDeactivate(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the waypoint movement generator for a creature, stopping its
    path following behavior.
  description: The DoDeactivate method is responsible for deactivating a WaypointMovementGenerator
    instance, which typically occurs when a creature's movement needs to be halted
    or when the movement generator is being removed from the creature's AI system.
    This method ensures that any ongoing waypoint path following is stopped and cleans
    up internal state. It is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework where creatures
    can follow predefined waypoints to move through the world. The method does not
    take any parameters and is typically called internally by the AI system or when
    transitioning between different movement behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deactivating a Waypoint Movement Generator
    code: "Creature* creature = ...; // Get reference to a creature\nWaypointMovementGenerator*\
      \ wpGen = dynamic_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      if (wpGen)\n{\n    wpGen->DoDeactivate(creature);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system's internal logic when a
    creature's movement needs to be interrupted or replaced. It is important to note
    that this method should only be called on active waypoint movement generators,
    and calling it on inactive ones may lead to undefined behavior. The method does
    not directly modify the creature's position but rather stops the generator from
    updating the creature's movement.
