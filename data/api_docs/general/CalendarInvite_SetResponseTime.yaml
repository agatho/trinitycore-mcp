  class: CalendarInvite
  method: SetResponseTime
  signature: void CalendarInvite::SetResponseTime(time_t responseTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the response time for a calendar invite.
  description: The SetResponseTime method updates the timestamp indicating when a
    player responded to a calendar invitation. This time is typically set when a player
    accepts, declines, or ignores an invitation. The response time is stored internally
    and used for tracking invite status and synchronization with the game calendar
    system. This method does not validate the provided time value; it directly assigns
    the given timestamp to the invite's response time field.
  parameters:
  - name: responseTime
    description: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the player responded
      to the calendar invite. This should be a valid UTC timestamp, typically obtained
      using time(nullptr) or similar time functions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting response time for a calendar invite
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      // Assume we have a valid invite object

      std::time_t now = std::time(nullptr);

      invite->SetResponseTime(now);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating response time when player accepts an invite
    code: "void HandlePlayerAcceptInvite(CalendarInvite* invite) {\n    // Record\
      \ the time when player accepted the invite\n    std::time_t acceptTime = std::time(nullptr);\n\
      \    invite->SetResponseTime(acceptTime);\n    // Additional logic to update\
      \ invite status in database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarInvite object.
    It is typically called by the game server when processing player responses to
    calendar events, and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom
    calendar behavior. The response time is usually set once per invite and does not
    change after initial assignment.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same invite may overwrite previous
    response times, potentially causing incorrect tracking of player actions. Ensure
    that response times are only set when a player actually responds to an invite,
    not during initialization or other operations.
