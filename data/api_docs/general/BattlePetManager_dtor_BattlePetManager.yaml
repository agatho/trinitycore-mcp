documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlePetManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The BattlePetManager destructor is automatically invoked when a BattlePetManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, battle pet entries, and associated memory
    allocations. It typically handles releasing references to active battle pets,
    clearing pet databases, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system.
    The destructor is part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern, guaranteeing that resources are properly managed even if exceptions occur
    during object lifetime.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlePetManager
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BattlePetManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BattlePetManager pointer
    code: 'BattlePetManager* manager = new BattlePetManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the compiler when objects go out of
    scope. Developers should not manually call destructors unless performing explicit
    object destruction in dynamic memory scenarios. BattlePetManager may maintain
    internal references to player data or pet collections, so proper cleanup ensures
    no memory leaks occur during server shutdown or player logout.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are explicitly managing
    object lifetime through dynamic allocation. Avoid calling destructors on stack-allocated
    objects as it leads to undefined behavior. Ensure all battle pet references are
    properly cleared before the manager is destroyed to prevent dangling references.
