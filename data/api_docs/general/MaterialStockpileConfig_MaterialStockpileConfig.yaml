  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MaterialStockpileConfig class with default
    values.
  description: The MaterialStockpileConfig constructor initializes a new instance
    of the MaterialStockpileConfig class. This method sets up the internal state of
    the configuration object, typically initializing member variables to their default
    values or null states. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation
    framework, this class likely manages configuration data related to material stockpiles
    within the game world, such as resource limits, spawn rates, or other related
    parameters. The constructor ensures that all necessary internal structures are
    properly allocated and initialized before the object can be used for its intended
    purpose.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of MaterialStockpileConfig
    code: 'MaterialStockpileConfig config;

      // The config object is now initialized with default values

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new instance
    of the MaterialStockpileConfig class. Developers should be aware that this method
    may perform memory allocation and initialization operations, which could have
    performance implications in high-frequency usage scenarios.
