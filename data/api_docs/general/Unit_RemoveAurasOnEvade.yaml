documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras from the unit when it evades.
  description: This method removes all active auras from the Unit when it evades,
    typically used during combat situations where the unit needs to reset its state.
    The method ensures that no aura effects remain on the unit after evading, which
    is crucial for maintaining game balance and preventing unintended behavior during
    encounters. It is commonly used in NPC AI scripts to clean up the unit's aura
    state when it returns to its initial state after evading.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void MyNPC::Evade() {\n    // Remove all auras when evading\n    this->RemoveAurasOnEvade();\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during evading behavior in NPC AI scripts,
    and it should be used carefully as it may affect the unit's combat state. The
    method does not remove aura effects that are explicitly set to persist through
    evading.
  warnings: This method should only be used when evading to prevent unintended aura
    effects from remaining on the unit. If called incorrectly, it can lead to unexpected
    behavior during encounters.
