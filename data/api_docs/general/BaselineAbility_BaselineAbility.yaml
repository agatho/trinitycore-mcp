  class: BaselineAbility
  method: BaselineAbility
  signature: void BaselineAbility::BaselineAbility(int spell, int lvl, int cost, int
    cd, float pri, bool melee, bool defensive, bool utility)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new baseline ability with specified spell, level, cost, cooldown,
    priority, and behavior flags.
  description: The BaselineAbility constructor initializes a new ability instance
    with the provided parameters. This method sets up core properties such as the
    spell ID, required level, mana/energy cost, cooldown duration, priority weight
    for AI decision making, and behavioral flags indicating whether the ability is
    melee-based, defensive, or utility-oriented. The initialized ability can be used
    by NPCs or players within the TrinityCore framework to define their available
    actions during combat or other game states. This constructor is typically called
    when creating custom AI behaviors or defining spell usage patterns for game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The unique identifier of the spell associated with this baseline
      ability. Must be a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: lvl
    description: The minimum level required to use this ability. Must be a positive
      integer representing the character level threshold.
  - name: cost
    description: The resource cost (mana, energy, rage, etc.) required to activate
      this ability. Must be a non-negative integer.
  - name: cd
    description: The cooldown time in milliseconds after using this ability before
      it can be used again. Must be a non-negative integer.
  - name: pri
    description: The priority weight of this ability for AI decision-making algorithms.
      Higher values indicate higher preference for usage. Must be a positive float.
  - name: melee
    description: Flag indicating whether this ability is melee-based (true) or ranged/other
      type (false).
  - name: defensive
    description: Flag indicating whether this ability is primarily defensive in nature
      (true) or offensive (false).
  - name: utility
    description: Flag indicating whether this ability serves utility purposes such
      as healing, buffing, or debuffing (true) or is purely combat-oriented (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ability Initialization
    code: BaselineAbility fireball(1330, 10, 50, 2000, 1.5f, false, false, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Defensive Healing Ability
    code: BaselineAbility heal(2060, 5, 30, 3000, 2.0f, false, true, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the AI system implementation in TrinityCore and
    should only be called during object initialization or when dynamically creating
    new abilities for creatures or players. The parameters are validated internally
    but developers should ensure valid spell IDs and appropriate numerical values
    to prevent runtime errors.
  warnings: Incorrect spell ID values may result in invalid behavior or crashes within
    the AI system. Ensure that all parameters conform to expected ranges, especially
    for cooldown times and priority weights which affect AI decision-making performance.
