documentation:
  brief: Commands the beast mastery pet to begin following the player
  description: The CommandPetFollow method is responsible for initiating the follow
    behavior of a beast mastery pet, instructing it to move alongside the player character.
    This method is typically invoked when the player issues a 'follow' command through
    the UI or game mechanics, and it updates the pet's AI state to transition from
    idle or attack mode into a following state. The method ensures that the pet maintains
    a proper distance relative to the player while moving, and it handles the necessary
    pathfinding and movement updates required for the pet to stay in formation with
    the player.

  - title: Basic usage of CommandPetFollow
    code: 'BeastMasteryPetManager petManager;

      petManager.CommandPetFollow();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid beast mastery pet exists and is under the
    player's control. It internally manages the pet's movement state and may trigger
    updates to the pet's AI behavior tree or movement manager. The implementation
    likely involves setting internal flags or states within the pet's AI system.
