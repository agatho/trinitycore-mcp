  class: Player
  method: SetAreaSpiritHealer
  signature: void Player::SetAreaSpiritHealer(Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's area spirit healer to a creature.
  description: This method assigns a specific creature as the player's area spirit
    healer, which is used for resurrection purposes when the player dies in an area
    where they cannot be resurrected by normal means. The method typically involves
    setting up the creature as a spirit healer that allows players to be resurrected
    at the location of the creature, rather than at their corpse or graveyard. This
    functionality is commonly used in battleground and arena environments where players
    can be resurrected at specific locations.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to a Creature object that will serve as the area spirit
      healer for the player. The creature must be valid and should be one of the allowed
      spirit healer types in the game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Creature* spiritHealer = new Creature();

      player->SetAreaSpiritHealer(spiritHealer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battlegrounds and arenas where players can
    be resurrected at specific locations. The creature must be valid and should be
    one of the allowed spirit healer types in the game. Implementation details include
    ensuring that the creature is properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect resurrection behavior
    during battlegrounds or arenas, potentially causing players to be resurrected
    at incorrect locations or not at all. This method should only be called when the
    player is in a valid battleground or arena environment.
