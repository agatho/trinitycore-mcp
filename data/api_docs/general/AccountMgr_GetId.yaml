documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique account identifier for a given username
  description: The GetId method is used to obtain the unique numeric identifier (ID)
    associated with a specific account username within the TrinityCore database. This
    ID is essential for various account-related operations such as authentication,
    session management, and retrieving account-specific data. The method typically
    performs a database lookup using the provided username to find its corresponding
    account ID. It's commonly used in login procedures and account validation processes.
    The method assumes that the username exists in the database; otherwise, it may
    return an invalid or default value.
  parameters:
  - name: username
    description: The username string for which to retrieve the account ID. This should
      be a valid, non-empty string matching an existing account in the database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique account identifier. If no
    matching account is found, it typically returns 0 or another default invalid ID
    value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve account ID
    code: "uint32 accountId = AccountMgr::GetId(\"player123\");\nif (accountId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Valid account ID found\n    printf(\"Account ID for player123\
      \ is: %u\\n\", accountId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No account found with that username\n\
      \    printf(\"No account found with username player123\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query internally and should be used
    judiciously to avoid performance issues. It's recommended to cache results when
    the same account lookups are performed repeatedly. The method may throw exceptions
    or return error codes in certain implementations depending on how it's designed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with unvalidated input as it might
    lead to database lookup failures or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the username
    parameter is properly sanitized and validated before calling to prevent potential
    security vulnerabilities or performance degradation.
