  class: ClearcastingTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 ClearcastingTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Clearcasting aura.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Clearcasting
    spell effect. Clearcasting is a damage reduction buff that reduces the casting
    time of spells, typically applied by certain classes or abilities in World of
    Warcraft. This method allows access to the current stack level of the aura, which
    directly affects how much the casting time is reduced. The returned value represents
    the number of times the Clearcasting effect has been applied or refreshed, with
    each stack contributing to the overall reduction percentage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of stacks for the Clearcasting
    aura. Returns 0 if the aura is not active on the target.
  examples:
  - title: Check Clearcasting Stacks Before Casting
    code: "if (ClearcastingTracker* tracker = player->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_CLEARCASTING,\
      \ 0))\n{\n    uint32 stacks = tracker->GetStacks();\n    if (stacks > 0)\n \
      \   {\n        // Proceed with spell casting that benefits from Clearcasting\n\
      \        // The actual reduction logic would be handled by the core\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with aura tracking systems to
    determine the current state of a player's Clearcasting effect. It should only
    be called on valid aura objects that are known to be of the Clearcasting type.
