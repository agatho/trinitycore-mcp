documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the world object is currently visible to players at far
    distances.
  description: The IsFarVisible method checks if a WorldObject is considered visible
    to players when they are at greater distances, typically beyond normal visibility
    range. This method is used in the context of distance-based visibility calculations
    for objects such as units, game objects, or dynamic objects within the TrinityCore
    framework. It evaluates internal flags and state information to determine whether
    the object should be included in the player's far visibility range, which affects
    network updates and rendering. The result can be used by systems that manage object
    visibility, such as those responsible for sending updates to clients or determining
    when an object should be rendered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the world object is visible at far distances, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the object should be included in player visibility calculations
    for distant ranges.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature is visible at far distance
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nif (creature->IsFarVisible()) {\n    // Object\
      \ is visible to players at far distances\n    // Perform actions related to\
      \ far visibility\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in visibility update logic
    code: "WorldObject* object = ...;\nif (object->IsFarVisible()) {\n    // Send\
      \ update packet for far visibility\n    object->SendUpdateToPlayer(player);\n\
      } else {\n    // Object is not visible, do not send updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal visibility flags and distance
    calculations. It may be used in conjunction with other visibility-related methods
    like IsVisible(), IsWithinDist(), or IsInMap(). The implementation might consider
    object type, movement state, and server-side visibility rules.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for all visibility checks. Depending
    on the context, additional distance or visibility calculations may be required.
    This method may not account for all edge cases such as stealth, invisibility,
    or specific game mechanics that override standard visibility rules.
