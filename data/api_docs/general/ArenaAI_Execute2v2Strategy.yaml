  class: ArenaAI
  method: Execute2v2Strategy
  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute2v2Strategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 2v2 arena strategy for the specified player in the ArenaAI system.
  description: The Execute2v2Strategy method is responsible for applying the appropriate
    tactical behavior and decision-making logic specific to 2v2 arena combat scenarios
    within the ArenaAI framework. This method determines how a player should act during
    a 2v2 match, including positioning, targeting, and resource management decisions
    based on the current game state and opponent behavior. It integrates with the
    broader AI system to ensure optimal performance during competitive arena battles.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter specifies which player's strategy should
      be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Combat
    code: "void MyArenaHandler::ProcessArenaCombat()\n{\n    int playerIndex = 0;\n\
      \    arenaAI->Execute2v2Strategy(&playerIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during active arena matches and relies on
    the ArenaAI system's internal state tracking. It assumes that the player has been
    properly initialized within the arena framework and that the game environment
    is in a valid combat state.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect AI decision-making. Ensure that the player index points to a valid
    participant in the current arena match before calling this method.
