  class: PhasingHandler
  method: SetAlwaysVisible
  signature: void PhasingHandler::SetAlwaysVisible(WorldObject * object, bool apply,
    bool updateVisibility)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a WorldObject is always visible to players regardless of phasing
    rules.
  description: The SetAlwaysVisible method controls whether a specified WorldObject
    remains visible to players even when standard phasing rules would normally hide
    it. This is particularly useful for objects that should persist in visibility
    across different phases, such as quest items, NPCs with special behaviors, or
    world events. When apply is true, the object becomes immune to phase-based visibility
    restrictions; when false, normal phasing behavior resumes. The updateVisibility
    parameter determines whether the visibility change is immediately applied to all
    nearby players.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that will have its visibility behavior
      modified. Must not be null.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      always visible behavior for the object.
  - name: updateVisibility
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to immediately update visibility
      for all nearby players. If false, visibility changes will be applied on next
      update cycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Make an NPC always visible
    code: 'Creature* npc = ...; // Get reference to NPC

      PhasingHandler::SetAlwaysVisible(npc, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable always visible for a quest item
    code: 'GameObject* questItem = ...; // Get reference to quest item

      PhasingHandler::SetAlwaysVisible(questItem, false, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the object's phasing state directly. It does not modify
    the object's actual phase mask but rather overrides the visibility logic. The
    change is persistent across server restarts if the object remains in memory.
  warnings: Using this method on objects that are frequently created/destroyed may
    lead to memory leaks or inconsistent behavior. Always ensure proper cleanup when
    disabling always visible mode.
