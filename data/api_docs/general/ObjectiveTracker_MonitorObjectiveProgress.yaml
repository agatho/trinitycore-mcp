  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: MonitorObjectiveProgress
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::MonitorObjectiveProgress(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors progress for a specific quest objective of a player bot.
  description: The MonitorObjectiveProgress method tracks and updates the progress
    of a specified quest objective for a given player bot. This functionality is typically
    used in automated questing systems or AI-driven gameplay mechanics where the game
    needs to monitor quest completion status. The method likely updates internal tracking
    structures to reflect changes in objective progress, potentially triggering events
    or notifications when objectives are completed. It operates on a per-objective
    basis, allowing fine-grained control over which specific quest elements are being
    monitored.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      is being monitored. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective to monitor.
      Must correspond to an existing active quest for the bot.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index position of the specific objective within the quest's objective
      list. Zero-based indexing, must be valid for the given quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Objective Monitoring
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      objectiveTracker->MonitorObjectiveProgress(bot, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Multiple Objectives
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < quest->GetObjectiveCount(); ++i)\n{\n    objectiveTracker->MonitorObjectiveProgress(bot,\
      \ questId, i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's quest system and may update
    internal state tracking. It should only be called for valid quests and objectives
    to avoid undefined behavior. The implementation may rely on the bot player being
    in a valid state for quest progression checks.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid questId or objectiveIndex values may
    result in crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot player is properly
    initialized and has the specified quest active before calling this method.
