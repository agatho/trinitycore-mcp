  brief: Moves an AccountMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    target object.
  description: The move assignment operator for the AccountMgr class transfers all
    resources from the source AccountMgr object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used when you want to efficiently transfer ownership of an AccountMgr
    instance without performing a deep copy. After the move, the source object is
    left in a valid but unspecified state, typically in a moved-from state where it
    should not be used for operations that require a fully initialized object. This
    method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and is commonly used in
    containers and smart pointer implementations within TrinityCore's account management
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current AccountMgr object after the move operation has
    completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'AccountMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... initialize sourceMgr ...

      AccountMgr targetMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Uses move assignment

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<AccountMgr> accountManagers;

      accountManagers.emplace_back();

      AccountMgr newManager;

      accountManagers[0] = std::move(newManager); // Move assignment in vector

      // newManager is now in moved-from state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator should only be called on rvalue references or objects explicitly
    marked for moving. The moved-from object must not be used for operations that
    require a fully initialized state. This implementation follows standard C++ move
    semantics where the source object's resources are transferred to the target, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that objects are not used after being moved from. Be cautious
    when using this operator in contexts where the source object might be accessed
    again.
