  brief: Sets whether the spell is referenced from current spell.
  description: This method controls the reference status of a spell from the current
    spell context. It determines whether the spell should be considered as being referenced
    from another spell in the current spell's context, affecting how the spell behaves
    during execution and interaction with other spells. The method is typically used
    in spell handling logic to manage references between different spell instances.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      // This sets the spell to be referenced from current spell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell handling and execution contexts where
    reference tracking is important. It may affect how spells interact with each other
    during processing, particularly in complex spell systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell referencing behavior,
    potentially causing issues with spell execution or interaction with other spells
    in the system.
