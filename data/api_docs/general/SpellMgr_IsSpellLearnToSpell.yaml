    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if one spell learns another spell, returning true if spell_id1 teaches
    spell_id2.
  description: The IsSpellLearnToSpell method determines whether a given spell (spell_id1)
    is capable of teaching or learning another spell (spell_id2). This functionality
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's spell system to verify prerequisites for
    spell learning, such as checking if a profession skill can teach a specific recipe
    or if a talent unlocks another ability. The method performs a lookup in the spell
    learning database tables to validate this relationship. It does not consider player
    state or level requirements; it only checks for direct spell-to-spell relationships
    defined in the game's data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: spell_id1
    description: The identifier of the first spell that may teach or learn another
      spell.
  - name: spell_id2
    description: The identifier of the second spell which is potentially being learned
      from the first spell.
  returns: Returns true if spell_id1 teaches or learns spell_id2; otherwise returns
    false. If either spell ID does not exist in the spell database, the method will
    return false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell teaches another spell
    code: "if (sSpellMgr->IsSpellLearnToSpell(12345, 67890)) {\n    // Spell 12345\
      \ teaches spell 67890\n    printf(\"Spell 12345 teaches spell 67890\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in spell learning validation
    code: "uint32 playerSpell = 54321;\nuint32 requiredSpell = 98765;\n\nif (sSpellMgr->IsSpellLearnToSpell(playerSpell,\
      \ requiredSpell)) {\n    // Player can learn the required spell through their\
      \ current spell\n    // Proceed with spell learning logic\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot learn the required spell\n    // Handle error or prevent learning\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell learning data structures and assumes
    that both spell IDs are valid. It is typically used during spell validation, skill
    progression checks, and in conjunction with player spell book management systems.
    The implementation may involve database lookups or cached data depending on how
    the SpellMgr class is designed.
  warnings: Ensure that both spell IDs passed to this method are valid and exist in
    the game's spell database. Passing invalid or non-existent spell IDs will result
    in false returns, which might mask actual logic errors in spell learning systems.
