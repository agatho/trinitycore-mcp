  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  signature: void SplineChainMovementGenerator::SplineChainMovementGenerator(const
    int & info)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spline chain movement generator with provided information.
  description: The SplineChainMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement
    generator that handles spline-based pathfinding for units in the game world. This
    class is used to define and manage complex movement patterns, such as those required
    for NPCs or creatures following predefined paths. The constructor accepts an integer
    parameter representing configuration data or identifier for the specific movement
    chain. It sets up internal state variables and prepares the generator for use
    with the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: An integer value that represents configuration information or identifier
      for the spline chain movement. This could include path index, movement type,
      or other identifying data used to initialize the movement behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: SplineChainMovementGenerator generator(42);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeMovement()\
      \ {\n        SplineChainMovementGenerator gen(100);\n        // Further setup\
      \ with movement generator\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during AI initialization or when a creature
    needs to begin following a specific spline-based path. The 'info' parameter should
    be validated before use, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or failed
    movement execution.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor without proper context; it's intended for
    internal AI system usage and requires valid configuration data to function correctly.
    Improper initialization can cause movement glitches or crashes in the game world.
