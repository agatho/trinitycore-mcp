  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: EvaluateTargets
  signature: int TargetAssistAction::EvaluateTargets(Player * bot, Group * group)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the optimal target for a bot to assist based on group
    dynamics and combat state.
  description: The EvaluateTargets method determines the most suitable target for
    a bot to assist within a group context. It analyzes the current combat situation,
    player health, threat levels, and group composition to select an appropriate target
    that maximizes group effectiveness. This method is typically used in AI-driven
    bot behavior systems where automated players need to make tactical decisions about
    which enemy to focus on. The method considers factors such as target proximity,
    threat level, and whether the target is already being engaged by other group members.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      targets. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the bot and its group members.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group with active
      members.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the target ID or index of the evaluated
    target. A value of 0 typically indicates no suitable target was found, while positive
    values correspond to valid target identifiers within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI context
    code: "int targetId = bot->GetAI()->EvaluateTargets(bot, bot->GetGroup());\nif\
      \ (targetId > 0) {\n    // Proceed with attacking or assisting the selected\
      \ target\n    bot->SetTarget(targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group combat logic
    code: "class BotCombatAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateCombat(Player* bot) {\n  \
      \      Group* group = bot->GetGroup();\n        if (!group) return;\n      \
      \  \n        int targetId = EvaluateTargets(bot, group);\n        if (targetId\
      \ > 0 && targetId != bot->GetTarget()) {\n            bot->SetTarget(targetId);\n\
      \            bot->AttackStart(targetId);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and relies on internal game
    state tracking. The evaluation process may consider player class, level differences,
    and combat roles within the group. Performance-wise, this method should be called
    sparingly during combat updates to avoid excessive CPU usage.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and group parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as null pointer dereferences can cause crashes. The method assumes that
    the bot is part of a valid group and that the game world state is consistent.
