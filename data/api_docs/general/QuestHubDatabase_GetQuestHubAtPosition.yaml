  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: GetQuestHubAtPosition
  signature: const QuestHub * QuestHubDatabase::GetQuestHubAtPosition(const int &
    pos, std::optional<uint32> zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a QuestHub object at the specified position, optionally filtered
    by zone ID.
  description: The GetQuestHubAtPosition method retrieves a const pointer to a QuestHub
    object located at the given position within the quest hub system. It allows filtering
    of results based on an optional zone identifier. This method is typically used
    to find specific quest hubs in the game world, such as those associated with particular
    zones or areas. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe for
    concurrent access. If no matching QuestHub is found, it returns a null pointer.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index used to locate the QuestHub in the internal collection.
      This represents an ordered position within the quest hub data structure.
  - name: zoneId
    description: An optional zone identifier that filters the results to only include
      QuestHubs associated with the specified zone. If not provided or set to std::nullopt,
      all QuestHubs at the given position are considered.
  returns: A const pointer to a QuestHub object if one exists at the specified position
    and matches the optional zone filter; otherwise, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve QuestHub at Position 0
    code: const QuestHub* hub = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHubAtPosition(0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieve QuestHub at Position 5 Filtered by Zone ID
    code: const QuestHub* hub = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHubAtPosition(5, 1234);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structure of QuestHubDatabase
    is properly initialized and populated. It's recommended to validate the returned
    pointer before dereferencing it in production code.
  warnings: Ensure that the position index passed into this method is within valid
    bounds to avoid undefined behavior. Also, be cautious when using optional zone
    IDs as they may not match any existing zones, leading to a null return value.
