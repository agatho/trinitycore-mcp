documentation:
  brief: Returns the first rank spell in the spell chain for a given SpellInfo.
  description: This method retrieves the initial spell in a spell chain, typically
    used for determining the base spell that starts a sequence of related spells.
    It is commonly employed in spell progression systems where each subsequent rank
    builds upon the previous one. The returned SpellInfo represents the foundational
    spell from which all other ranks are derived, and it's essential for understanding
    spell mechanics and progression within World of Warcraft's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellInfo representing the first rank spell in
    the chain. If no such spell exists or the current spell is already the first rank,
    this will return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const SpellInfo* firstSpell = spellInfo->GetFirstRankSpell();\nif (firstSpell)\n\
      {\n    // Use firstSpell to get base spell information\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    like GetSpellInfo or GetRankSpell. Performance considerations are minimal as it
    simply returns a pointer without complex operations.
