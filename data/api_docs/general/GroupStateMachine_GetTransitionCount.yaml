  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: GetTransitionCount
  signature: uint32 GroupStateMachine::GetTransitionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of state transitions that have occurred within the
    group state machine.
  description: The GetTransitionCount method retrieves the cumulative count of all
    state transitions that have been processed by the GroupStateMachine instance.
    This counter is typically incremented each time a group's state changes, such
    as when members join or leave, or when the group's role distribution shifts. The
    method provides insight into the dynamic behavior and activity level of a group
    within the game context. It is a read-only operation that does not modify any
    internal state of the group machine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of transitions that have occurred
    since the group state machine was initialized or reset. Each transition corresponds
    to a change in the group's operational state, such as entering a new phase or
    updating member roles.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupStateMachine* groupSM = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupStateMachine();

      uint32 transitionCount = groupSM->GetTransitionCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Group has undergone %u state transitions.", transitionCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging or monitoring purposes to track
    how frequently a group's state changes during gameplay. The counter may be reset
    under certain conditions, such as when a new group leader takes control or upon
    group disbanding.
