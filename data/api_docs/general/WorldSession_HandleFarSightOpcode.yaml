documentation:
  brief: Toggles the far sight ability for the player, allowing them to view units
    or objects from a distance.
  description: The HandleFarSightOpcode method processes incoming client packets related
    to the Far Sight spell functionality in World of Warcraft. This opcode allows
    players to temporarily view the world from another unit's perspective, typically
    used with game masters or specific quest mechanics. The method handles enabling
    or disabling this view mode and updates the player's camera state accordingly.
    It interacts with the player's current target and may affect visibility of nearby
    units depending on the implementation details of the spell effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Far Sight Toggle
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleFarSightOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::FarSight& packet)\n\
      {\n    // Process the far sight packet\n    if (packet.Enable)\n        SendFarSightEnable();\n\
      \    else\n        SendFarSightDisable();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player uses the Far Sight spell or
    related game master functionality. The implementation may involve updating client-side
    camera settings and modifying visibility of units in the player's field of view.
    Consider performance implications when handling multiple simultaneous far sight
    requests.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode can lead to visual glitches or incorrect
    unit visibility states. Ensure proper validation of packet data before processing,
    especially when dealing with player-targeted spells that might be abused by clients.
