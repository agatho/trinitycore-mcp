  brief: Populates the cumulative distribution table based on character data for bot
    assignment logic
  description: Builds a cumulative probability distribution from character data to
    enable weighted random selection of characters for bot assignments. This method
    processes available character statistics and generates internal lookup tables
    that support efficient distribution-based selection algorithms. The cumulative
    distribution is typically used in conjunction with random number generation to
    determine which character type or class should be assigned to a bot based on predefined
    weights and probabilities.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution distribution;

      distribution.BuildCumulativeDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after character data has been loaded or updated
    to ensure the cumulative distribution reflects current statistics. The internal
    implementation likely involves sorting and calculating prefix sums of probability
    weights.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior initialization of character data may
    result in an empty or invalid distribution table. This method modifies internal
    state and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper
    synchronization.
