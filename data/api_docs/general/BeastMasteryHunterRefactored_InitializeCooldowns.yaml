documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for beast mastery abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for the hunter's beast mastery abilities. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when switching to the beast mastery specialization.
    It ensures that all relevant abilities start with proper cooldown states, preventing
    immediate usage of abilities upon entering combat. The method handles internal
    state management for cooldown tracking and synchronization with the game's timing
    system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the hunter's initialization
    phase. It is typically invoked automatically by the core game system when the
    player selects the beast mastery specialization or when entering a new combat
    encounter.
