documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the joined append container
  description: The Append method is used to add channel notification data to a JoinedAppend
    container. This method is typically invoked when processing channel-related events
    such as join/leave notifications, chat messages, or moderation actions within
    the World of Warcraft client-server communication framework. The method takes
    a reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet structure and incorporates
    its contents into the internal data structure managed by the JoinedAppend class.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining synchronized channel state information
    across the game's networked environment.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'JoinedAppend appendContainer;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyData;

      // Populate notifyData with channel event information

      appendContainer.Append(notifyData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet handling infrastructure and
    should only be called within the context of network packet processing. The JoinedAppend
    class likely maintains an internal buffer or list of channel notifications that
    are processed in sequence.
