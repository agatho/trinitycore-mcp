  signature: void BotActionProcessor::BotActionProcessor(BotActionQueue & queue)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BotActionProcessor with the specified action queue for processing
    bot actions.
  description: The BotActionProcessor constructor initializes the processor with a
    reference to a BotActionQueue. This queue contains pending bot actions that will
    be processed by the processor in the order they are added. The processor is responsible
    for executing these actions according to game logic and timing constraints. This
    initialization step is crucial for setting up the action handling pipeline for
    bot characters within the TrinityCore framework.

    code: 'BotActionQueue queue;

      BotActionProcessor processor(queue);

      // The processor is now ready to process actions from the queue'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate action processing. It simply
    stores a reference to the provided queue for later use. The actual processing
    of actions occurs through other methods in the BotActionProcessor class, typically
    called during game update cycles.
