  class: FriendlyBelowHpPctEntryInRange
  method: operator()
  signature: bool FriendlyBelowHpPctEntryInRange::operator()(int * u)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a friendly unit is below the specified HP percentage within
    range.
  description: The operator() method of FriendlyBelowHpPctEntryInRange is used in
    TrinityCore's AI system to determine if any friendly unit (such as a player or
    NPC) meets the criteria of being below a certain health percentage and located
    within a defined range. This method is typically employed by AI decision-making
    logic, particularly in creature AI scripts, to trigger specific behaviors when
    nearby allies are critically low on health. It acts as a predicate function that
    can be used with STL algorithms or AI condition checks. The method returns true
    if at least one friendly unit satisfies the conditions, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is essential for implementing group-based combat strategies where
    units respond to the health status of their companions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether any friendly unit in range is
    below the specified HP percentage. True if at least one such unit exists; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI condition check
    code: "if (FriendlyBelowHpPctEntryInRange(30)(nullptr)) {\n    // Trigger healing\
      \ or support ability\n    creature->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HEALING_POTION,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a cached list of nearby friendly units and
    may have performance implications if used excessively in tight loops. It is designed
    to be used within AI context where the range and HP threshold are pre-configured.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI system calling this method has properly initialized
    the range and HP percentage parameters, as incorrect configuration can lead to
    unexpected behavior or no triggering of AI actions.
