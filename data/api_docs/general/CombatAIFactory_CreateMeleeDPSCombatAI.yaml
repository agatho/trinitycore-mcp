documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a melee DPS combat AI for a bot
  description: The CreateMeleeDPSCombatAI method is responsible for instantiating
    a combat AI specifically designed for melee damage dealer roles within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function allocates memory for a new combat AI instance, configures
    it with appropriate melee combat behaviors and tactics, and assigns it to the
    specified bot. The method integrates with the broader AI system to ensure proper
    behavior during combat scenarios, including target selection, movement patterns,
    and ability usage tailored for melee DPS classes. It typically requires that a
    valid bot reference exists before execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or handle.
      This parameter specifies which bot instance should receive the new melee DPS
      combat AI. The value must be a valid, non-null pointer to an integer that references
      an existing bot within the system.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation and assignment of
    the AI. Non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid
    bot reference, insufficient memory, or failed initialization of the combat AI
    components.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateMeleeDPSCombatAI(&botId);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for bot\n    printf(\"Melee\
      \ DPS AI created for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n \
      \   printf(\"Failed to create melee DPS AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and assumes that the underlying
    bot infrastructure is properly initialized. The created AI will automatically
    integrate with existing combat systems and may require additional configuration
    for specific class abilities or talents.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid, initialized bot before
    calling this method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    This function does not validate the bot's current state or role, so callers should
    ensure the bot is suitable for melee DPS AI assignment.
