  method: GetActionsByPriority
  signature: int ActionPriorityQueue::GetActionsByPriority(ActionPriority priority)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of actions associated with a specified priority level
    in the action priority queue.
  description: The GetActionsByPriority method returns the count of actions that have
    been assigned a specific priority level within the ActionPriorityQueue. This method
    is typically used in AI systems to determine how many actions are queued for execution
    at a given priority, which helps in managing action scheduling and resource allocation.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only. It assumes that
    the ActionPriority enum values are valid and properly defined within the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of actions currently assigned to the
    specified priority level. Returns zero if no actions exist for that priority or
    if the priority is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue queue;

      // Assume some actions have been added with various priorities

      int count = queue.GetActionsByPriority(ActionPriority::High);

      // count now holds the number of high-priority actions in the queue'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan through the internal action list to count
    items matching the specified priority. For large queues, performance may be impacted.
    The method is thread-safe if the underlying data structure supports concurrent
    reads.
  warnings: Ensure that the ActionPriority enum values passed to this method are valid
    and defined within the system; otherwise, unexpected behavior or incorrect counts
    may occur.
