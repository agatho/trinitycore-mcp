  class: PlayerAchievementMgr
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void PlayerAchievementMgr::DeleteFromDB(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all achievement data associated with a specific player from the database.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes all recorded achievement progress and
    data for a given player identified by their GUID from the TrinityCore database.
    This operation is typically used when a player character is deleted or when resetting
    achievements for administrative purposes. The method performs a direct database
    delete operation without returning any status information, implying that it either
    succeeds or fails silently at the API level. It's important to note that this
    action is irreversible and affects only the database storage; in-memory data structures
    are not automatically updated by this call.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose achievement data
      should be deleted from the database. This value must correspond to an existing
      player character in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete achievements for a specific player
    code: 'PlayerAchievementMgr* mgr = player->GetAchievementMgr();

      uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      mgr->DeleteFromDB(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should be used carefully,
    particularly in high-concurrency environments. It does not invalidate any cached
    data in memory, so additional cleanup may be required if the player object remains
    active. The operation is synchronous and blocks until completion.
  warnings: Using this method on a live server without proper safeguards can result
    in loss of player progress data. Ensure that all related systems (such as in-memory
    caches or session tracking) are properly synchronized after calling this function
    to avoid inconsistencies.
