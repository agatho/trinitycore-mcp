documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified item is a reagent class item used in spell
    crafting or enchanting.
  description: The IsClassReagent method checks if a given ItemTemplate represents
    an item that belongs to the 'reagent' class, which are items typically consumed
    during spell casting or enchanting processes in World of Warcraft. This classification
    is important for vendor interactions, as reagents may be sold by specific vendors
    or have special handling in crafting systems. The method evaluates the item's
    class and subclass properties against predefined reagent criteria to make this
    determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as a reagent (i.e., it belongs to
    the reagent class), false otherwise. This indicates whether the item can be used
    in spell crafting or enchanting operations that require consumable materials.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a reagent
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (vendorManager.IsClassReagent(itemTemplate))\
      \ {\n    // This item can be used as a reagent in spell crafting\n    printf(\"\
      Item %d is a reagent\\n\", itemTemplate->ItemId);\n} else {\n    // This item\
      \ cannot be used as a reagent\n    printf(\"Item %d is not a reagent\\n\", itemTemplate->ItemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal classification of items within the TrinityCore
    database. Items marked with class ID 12 (Reagents) and appropriate subclass IDs
    are considered reagents. The check is performed against the ItemTemplate structure
    which contains all item properties before instantiation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause a crash. This method
    does not validate the existence of the item in the database - it only checks the
    template data.
