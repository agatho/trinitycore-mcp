documentation:
  brief: Compares two ConditionId objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this ConditionId
    instance and another ConditionId object to determine if they are equal. In the
    context of TrinityCore's condition system, ConditionId objects represent unique
    identifiers for game conditions that control when certain actions or events can
    occur. This comparison is typically used during condition evaluation to check
    if two conditions refer to the same logical entity. The method returns true if
    both ConditionId objects have identical internal values, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining consistency in conditional logic
    throughout the game's scripting and event systems.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ConditionId object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      represents another condition identifier that will be compared for equality with
      the current object.
  returns: Returns true if both ConditionId objects are equal (have identical internal
    values), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Condition Comparison
    code: 'ConditionId id1(12345);

      ConditionId id2(12345);

      bool result = (id1 == id2); // Returns true

      ConditionId id3(67890);

      result = (id1 == id3); // Returns false'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "void CheckCondition(ConditionId currentCondition, ConditionId targetCondition)\
      \ {\n    if (currentCondition == targetCondition) {\n        // Execute condition-specific\
      \ logic\n        sLog->outString(\"Condition matched: %u\", currentCondition.GetId());\n\
      \    } else {\n        sLog->outString(\"Condition mismatch\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a simple value comparison of
    the underlying condition identifier. The performance is O(1) as it only involves
    comparing internal data members. This method should be used carefully in performance-critical
    sections where frequent comparisons occur.
