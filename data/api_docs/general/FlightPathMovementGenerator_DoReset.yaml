  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: DoReset
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoReset(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the flight path movement generator state for a player
  description: The DoReset method initializes or reinitializes the flight path movement
    generator, typically called when a player begins or restarts a flight path. This
    method ensures that all internal state variables are properly reset to their default
    values, clearing any previous flight path data and preparing the generator for
    a new flight path execution. It is commonly invoked during player movement updates
    or when transitioning between different flight path states within the game's AI
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose flight path movement state will
      be reset
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset flight path for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      FlightPathMovementGenerator* generator = new FlightPathMovementGenerator();

      generator->DoReset(player); // Reset the flight path movement state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active flight path movement generators.
    It is typically invoked internally by the movement system and not meant for direct
    external calls unless specifically required during custom AI implementations.
  warnings: Calling DoReset on a null player pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player object is valid before invoking this method.
