documentation:
  brief: Abandons a specific quest in the player's quest log
  description: The AbandonQuest method removes a quest from the player's quest log,
    effectively canceling the quest and freeing up quest slots for new quests. This
    method is typically used when a player wants to give up on a quest that they have
    started but are unable to complete or when they wish to abandon a quest for strategic
    reasons. The method does not immediately remove the quest from the player's inventory;
    instead, it marks the quest as abandoned and updates the quest log accordingly.
    This action can be performed at any time during gameplay, provided the quest is
    in the player's active quest log.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be abandoned. This parameter
      must match a valid quest ID currently in the player's quest log or the method
      will not perform any action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Abandoning a Quest
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      player->AbandonQuest(questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the player's quest log and does not affect quest objectives
    or progress. It is important to note that this method only affects quests that
    are currently active in the player's quest log, and does not remove quests from
    the player's inventory if they have already completed the quest.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may cause quest completion
    requirements to be lost. If a quest has been completed but not yet turned in,
    abandoning it will prevent the player from receiving credit for completing the
    quest.
