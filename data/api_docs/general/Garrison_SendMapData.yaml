  class: Garrison
  method: SendMapData
  signature: void Garrison::SendMapData(Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends garrison map data to the specified player.
  description: The SendMapData method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state of a garrison's map information to a specific player character. This includes
    details about the garrison's layout, building placements, and any relevant visual
    or functional data that needs to be synchronized with the client. The method is
    typically invoked when a player interacts with their garrison or when the garrison
    state changes in a way that requires UI updates. It ensures that the player's
    client has the most up-to-date information about their garrison's configuration
    and available structures.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the garrison map
      data. This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to a player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Garrison Map Data to a Player
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    garrison->SendMapData(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely constructs and sends a packet containing map-related data
    to the client. It may involve serialization of building positions, plot states,
    and other garrison-specific information. The implementation might be optimized
    to only send changes since the last update to reduce bandwidth usage.
  warnings: Ensure that the receiver parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify
    that the player's session is active and valid before attempting to send data.
