  class: Item
  method: SetCreateTime
  signature: void Item::SetCreateTime(int64 createTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the creation time of the item to the specified timestamp.
  description: This method assigns a creation time value to an Item object, which
    determines when the item was created within the game world. The creation time
    is typically used for tracking item expiration, durability, and other game mechanics
    related to item lifecycle. This method is commonly used during item initialization
    or when modifying item properties in the database. The timestamp is usually represented
    as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
  parameters:
  - name: createTime
    description: The creation time value to set for the item, typically expressed
      as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds. This value represents the moment when the
      item was created in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Creation Time for Item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      item->SetCreateTime(1609459200000LL); // Set to Jan 1, 2021

      // This sets the creation time of the item to a specific timestamp'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the internal creation time field of the Item
    object. It should be used carefully during item initialization or when updating
    item data in database operations. The timestamp value must be valid and represent
    a real point in time.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may affect item expiration or
    durability tracking if used incorrectly. This method should not be used to modify
    item properties that are already in use by the game mechanics.
