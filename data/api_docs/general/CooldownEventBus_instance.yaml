documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CooldownEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the CooldownEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the cooldown event bus exists throughout
    the application. This instance is responsible for managing and dispatching cooldown-related
    events within the TrinityCore framework. The method is thread-safe and provides
    access to global cooldown event handling functionality. It should be called whenever
    cooldown events need to be subscribed to or triggered.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single CooldownEventBus instance. The returned pointer
    is never null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CooldownEventBus* bus = CooldownEventBus::instance();\nbus->Subscribe(\"\
      player_cooldown\", [](const std::string& event, uint32_t cooldown_id) {\n  \
      \  // Handle cooldown event\n});"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering a Cooldown Event
    code: 'CooldownEventBus* bus = CooldownEventBus::instance();

      bus->Trigger("spell_cooldown_finished", 12345);

      // This would notify all subscribers of the spell cooldown finishing'
    language: cpp
  notes: The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime
    of the application. This pattern ensures consistent event handling across different
    subsystems that require cooldown management.
