  class: Creature
  method: GetCreatureTemplate
  signature: const CreatureTemplate * Creature::GetCreatureTemplate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature template data associated with this creature instance.
  description: The GetCreatureTemplate method retrieves the CreatureTemplate object
    that defines the base properties and behaviors of the current creature. This template
    contains information such as the creature's entry ID, display IDs, faction, AI
    type, and other essential data that determines how the creature behaves in the
    game world. The method is commonly used by AI scripts and game systems to access
    creature-specific data without having to perform additional database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CreatureTemplate structure which contains all
    static data defining the creature's base properties, or nullptr if the creature
    template could not be found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nconst CreatureTemplate* template = creature->GetCreatureTemplate();\n\
      if (template)\n{\n    uint32 entry = template->Entry;\n    uint32 displayId\
      \ = template->DisplayID;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Script Usage Example
    code: "// In an AI script\nvoid OnInitialize(Creature* creature)\n{\n    const\
      \ CreatureTemplate* templ = creature->GetCreatureTemplate();\n    if (templ\
      \ && templ->AIType == AI_TYPE_Melee)\n    {\n        // Perform actions based\
      \ on template data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from both player and creature
    AI contexts. The returned pointer should not be freed or modified as it points
    to static data that persists throughout the server runtime.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code sections,
    as accessing template data may involve database lookups if the template hasn't
    been loaded yet. Also note that null pointer checks are recommended before using
    the returned template.
