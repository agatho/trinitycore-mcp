  method: GetCraftingCost
  signature: uint32 EconomyManager::GetCraftingCost(uint32 recipeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the crafting cost associated with a specific recipe ID.
  description: The GetCraftingCost method retrieves the monetary or resource cost
    required to craft an item based on its recipe ID. This function is typically used
    within the EconomyManager class to determine the financial or material requirements
    for crafting items in World of Warcraft. The returned value represents the cost
    in copper coins, which can be used directly in transactions or comparisons with
    player inventory. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    a lookup operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the crafting cost in copper coins for
    the specified recipe. If the recipe ID is invalid or not found, the method may
    return zero or an undefined value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = economyMgr->GetCraftingCost(12345);\nif (cost > 0)\n{\n \
      \   printf(\"Crafting cost: %u copper\\n\", cost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Affordability
    code: "uint32 recipeId = 67890;\nuint32 playerMoney = player->GetMoney();\nuint32\
      \ craftingCost = economyMgr->GetCraftingCost(recipeId);\n\nif (playerMoney >=\
      \ craftingCost)\n{\n    // Player can afford to craft the item\n    printf(\"\
      Player can afford the recipe.\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot afford\
      \ the recipe\n    printf(\"Not enough money to craft this item.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or loaded from a database table containing recipe
    costs. It's recommended to cache results if frequently accessed to avoid repeated
    lookups. The method assumes valid recipe IDs are passed; invalid IDs might lead
    to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the recipe ID provided is valid before calling this function,
    as invalid IDs may result in incorrect or zero return values. This function should
    not be called during critical sections of code where performance is paramount
    due to potential database access.
