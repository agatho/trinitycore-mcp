  class: Creature
  method: SetRespawnCompatibilityMode
  signature: void Creature::SetRespawnCompatibilityMode(bool mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the respawn compatibility mode for a creature, enabling or disabling
    the use of respawn timers.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will use respawn timers to
    determine when it should reappear after being killed. When enabled, the creature
    will respect the respawn time set by the server configuration and will not immediately
    respawn upon death. When disabled, the creature will respawn immediately upon
    death, regardless of the configured respawn time. This setting affects how creatures
    behave in terms of respawn mechanics and can be used to control game difficulty
    or specific encounter behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      respawn compatibility mode. When true, the creature will respect respawn timers;
      when false, it will respawn immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Respawn Compatibility Mode
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetRespawnCompatibilityMode(true);

      // Creature will now respect respawn timers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's behavior during combat and respawn mechanics.
    It should be used carefully as it can impact game balance and encounter difficulty.
    The setting is typically applied during creature initialization or when creating
    custom encounters.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in creature
    respawns, potentially causing game balance issues or preventing proper encounter
    completion. Care should be taken when applying this setting in dynamic scenarios.
