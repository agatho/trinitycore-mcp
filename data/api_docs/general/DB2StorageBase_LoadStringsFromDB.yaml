documentation:
  brief: Loads localized string data from the database for the specified locale into
    the storage.
  description: The LoadStringsFromDB method retrieves and populates localized string
    entries from the database for a given locale. This method is typically used during
    server initialization or when switching locales to ensure that all string-based
    data, such as item names, quest text, and NPC dialogues, are correctly loaded
    according to the specified locale. It operates on the DB2StorageBase class instance,
    which manages storage of structured data tables (DB2 files) and their associated
    localized strings. The method assumes that database connections and necessary
    resources are already initialized and available.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Strings for English Locale
    code: 'DB2StorageBase storage;

      storage.LoadStringsFromDB(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      // Loads all localized strings for English locale into the storage.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Strings for German Locale During Runtime
    code: 'extern DB2StorageBase* g_ItemLocaleStorage;

      g_ItemLocaleStorage->LoadStringsFromDB(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_de);

      // Updates item locale strings to German during runtime.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by TrinityCore's data loading system.
    It may block until database queries complete, so it should not be called from
    performance-critical threads without consideration. The method relies on proper
    database connection setup and assumes that the required locale-specific string
    tables exist in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method after data has already been loaded might result in
    duplicate or inconsistent entries if not handled carefully. Ensure that the locale
    parameter is valid to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
