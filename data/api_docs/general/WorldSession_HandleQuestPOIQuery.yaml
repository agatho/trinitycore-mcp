documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to query quest point of interest data for a specific
    quest.
  description: The HandleQuestPOIQuery method handles incoming client requests to
    retrieve point of interest (POI) information related to a specific quest. This
    functionality is used by the World of Warcraft client to display visual markers
    and quest objectives on the map. The method typically receives a quest identifier
    from the client, validates it, and sends back relevant POI data including coordinates,
    icons, and associated quest objectives. This method plays a crucial role in providing
    players with visual feedback about quest locations and progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questPoiQuery
    description: A reference to the WorldPackets::Query::QuestPOIQuery packet containing
      the quest identifier and related query parameters sent by the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestPOIQuery(WorldPackets::Query::QuestPOIQuery\
      \ & questPoiQuery)\n{\n    uint32 questId = questPoiQuery.QuestID;\n    // Process\
      \ the quest POI query\n    SendQuestPOIData(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and is invoked
    when a client sends a quest POI query. It requires proper validation of the quest
    ID to prevent invalid data access. The method may trigger database queries to
    fetch POI information for the specified quest.
  warnings: Improper handling of quest IDs can lead to crashes or incorrect map markers.
    Ensure that all quest identifiers are validated before processing to avoid accessing
    invalid memory or database entries.
