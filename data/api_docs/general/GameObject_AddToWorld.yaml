documentation:
  brief: Adds the GameObject to the world update system, making it visible to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for inserting a GameObject into
    the world update system, ensuring that it becomes visible to players in the game
    world. This method typically gets called during the object initialization process
    when the GameObject is being spawned or when it needs to be made visible to players.
    The method handles the necessary internal updates to ensure that the GameObject's
    position and state are properly registered with the WorldObject manager, allowing
    players to interact with the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      // ... initialize the GameObject ...


      go->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the GameObject has been properly initialized
    and positioned in the world. It is typically invoked automatically during object
    creation, but developers may need to call it manually if the GameObject's position
    or state changes dynamically.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld multiple times on the same GameObject can lead to duplicate
    entries in the update system, potentially causing performance issues or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the GameObject has been properly initialized before calling
    this method.
