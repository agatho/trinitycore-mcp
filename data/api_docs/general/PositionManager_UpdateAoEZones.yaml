documentation:
  brief: Updates all area of effect zones in the current map based on the provided
    time.
  description: The UpdateAoEZones method processes and updates all active area of
    effect (AoE) zones within the current map. It iterates through registered AoE
    zones, checks their expiration times against the provided current time, and removes
    any expired zones from the system. This method is typically called during each
    game tick to ensure that dynamic environmental effects such as spell auras, traps,
    or other time-based area effects are properly managed. The method does not take
    any parameters beyond the current time, which is used to determine zone validity
    and expiration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all AoE zones with current time\n\
      \    sMapMgr->GetMap(0)->GetPositionManager()->UpdateAoEZones(getMSTime());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical and should be called frequently, typically
    once per game tick. It's designed to handle large numbers of active AoE zones
    efficiently by using optimized data structures for zone management.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game loop or with invalid
    time values, as it may cause unexpected behavior in zone expiration logic and
    could lead to memory leaks if zones are not properly cleaned up.
