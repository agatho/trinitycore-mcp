documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the F-cost value for this path node in the navigation
    mesh.
  description: The CalculateFCost method computes the total estimated cost (F-cost)
    for a path node, which is typically the sum of the G-cost (actual movement cost
    from start) and H-cost (heuristic estimate to goal). This value is used by pathfinding
    algorithms like A* to determine the optimal route through the game world. The
    method updates internal state variables of the PathNode object and should be called
    after G-cost or H-cost values have been set or modified. This calculation is essential
    for dynamic pathfinding systems within TrinityCore's AI and movement subsystems.

  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding context
    code: 'PathNode* node = new PathNode(position);

      node->SetGCost(10.0f);

      node->SetHCost(5.0f);

      node->CalculateFCost(); // Updates F-cost to 15.0f'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that G-cost and H-cost have already been initialized
    or updated. The F-cost calculation is fundamental to A* pathfinding performance,
    so it should be called efficiently during path search operations. Implementation
    typically involves simple arithmetic addition of G and H costs.
  warnings: Calling this method without setting G-cost and H-cost first may result
    in incorrect or uninitialized F-cost values. Ensure that all prerequisite cost
    values are properly calculated before invoking this method to avoid invalid pathfinding
    results.
