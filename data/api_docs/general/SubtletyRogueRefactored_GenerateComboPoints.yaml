documentation:
  brief: Generates combo points for a subtlety rogue player
  description: The GenerateComboPoints method is responsible for creating and assigning
    combo points to a subtlety rogue class character. This method typically gets invoked
    when the rogue performs actions that contribute to combo point generation, such
    as melee attacks or specific ability usage. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this method likely interacts with the player's combo point
    tracking system, updating internal state variables and potentially triggering
    visual feedback or cooldown adjustments. The method operates on the instance's
    current rogue character state and modifies combo point counters without returning
    any value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SubtletyRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Combo Points
    code: 'SubtletyRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(5); // Generates 5 combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat system and may interact with
    other subsystems such as cooldown management, ability activation, or UI updates.
    It should be called only when the rogue character is in a valid state for generating
    combo points.
  warnings: Ensure that the rogue instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Calling this method outside of combat
    or in invalid states may lead to incorrect combo point accumulation.
