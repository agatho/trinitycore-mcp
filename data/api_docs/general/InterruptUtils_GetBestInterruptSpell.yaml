  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetBestInterruptSpell
  signature: uint32 InterruptUtils::GetBestInterruptSpell(uint8 playerClass, InterruptType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID of the most effective interrupt ability available
    for a given player class and interrupt type.
  description: The GetBestInterruptSpell method determines and returns the highest
    priority interrupt spell ID based on the player's class and the type of interrupt
    required. This utility is typically used in combat scenarios where a player needs
    to interrupt an enemy's spellcasting or ability usage. The method evaluates class-specific
    abilities and their effectiveness against different interrupt types such as melee,
    ranged, or magical interrupts. It ensures that the most suitable interrupt spell
    is selected for optimal gameplay performance and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class identifier of the player (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE).
      Must be a valid class enum value.
  - name: type
    description: The type of interrupt being requested (e.g., INTERRUPT_MELEE, INTERRUPT_MAGIC).
      Must be a valid InterruptType enum value.
  returns: Returns the spell ID of the best available interrupt spell for the specified
    class and interrupt type. If no suitable interrupt spell is found, it returns
    0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get an interrupt spell for a warrior
    code: "uint32 spellId = InterruptUtils::GetBestInterruptSpell(CLASS_WARRIOR, INTERRUPT_MELEE);\n\
      if (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Use the interrupt spell\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using interrupt spell for a mage against magical interrupts
    code: "uint32 spellId = InterruptUtils::GetBestInterruptSpell(CLASS_MAGE, INTERRUPT_MAGIC);\n\
      if (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Cast the best available magic interrupt\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal class and spell data tables within TrinityCore.
    The implementation assumes that all relevant spells and classes are properly registered
    in the database. Performance is optimized through precomputed lookup tables for
    quick retrieval of interrupt spell information.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerClass and type parameters are valid enum
    values to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect results. Using invalid class IDs
    may lead to unexpected return values or crashes.
