  method: IsRemovedOnShapeLost
  signature: bool Aura::IsRemovedOnShapeLost(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura is removed when the target's shape changes.
  description: The IsRemovedOnShapeLost method checks if an aura should be removed
    from a unit when that unit's shape or form changes. This is commonly used for
    auras that are specific to certain forms, such as those granted by shapeshifting
    abilities like Cat Form or Bear Form. The method evaluates the aura's properties
    and returns true if the aura is considered invalid or should be removed upon a
    shape change, otherwise it returns false. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper gameplay mechanics related to form-based abilities and their associated
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura is removed when the target's shape changes, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an aura is removed on shape loss
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura && aura->IsRemovedOnShapeLost(player))\
      \ {\n    // Handle the case where aura will be removed on shape change\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Aura 12345 is removed on shape loss\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during form change events in the game engine.
    It's important to note that this check happens before the actual shape change
    occurs, so it can be used to determine if an aura needs cleanup prior to applying
    new effects.
