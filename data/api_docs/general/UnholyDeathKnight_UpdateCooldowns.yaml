  class: UnholyDeathKnight
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnight::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldowns for unholy death knight abilities based on the elapsed
    game time.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers of various abilities specific to the unholy death knight class.
    This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure that abilities
    become available again once their cooldown periods have expired. It processes
    the internal cooldown state of the death knight, reducing active cooldown timers
    by the elapsed time (diff) and marking abilities as ready when their cooldowns
    reach zero. The method plays a crucial role in maintaining proper game balance
    and ensuring that players cannot spam powerful abilities without appropriate waiting
    periods.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value represents how much time has passed and is used to decrement active cooldown
      timers accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_unholyDK->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Cooldown Logic
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnight::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_deathCoilCooldown\
      \ > 0)\n        m_deathCoilCooldown = std::max(0u, m_deathCoilCooldown - diff);\n\
      \    \n    if (m_pestilenceCooldown > 0)\n        m_pestilenceCooldown = std::max(0u,\
      \ m_pestilenceCooldown - diff);\n    \n    // Additional cooldown handling for\
      \ other abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate cooldown states. The 'diff' parameter must accurately reflect the time
    elapsed since the last call, otherwise cooldowns may behave inconsistently. Implementation
    typically involves checking each ability's cooldown state and updating it based
    on the passed time delta.
  warnings: Do not call this method with incorrect or zero time deltas as it will
    cause cooldown timers to advance incorrectly. Ensure that this method is only
    called from within a valid AI update context where time-based calculations are
    meaningful.
