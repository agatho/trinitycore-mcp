  class: CalendarMgr
  method: GetFreeInviteId
  signature: uint64 CalendarMgr::GetFreeInviteId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique 64-bit identifier for calendar invites within
    the TrinityCore server instance.
  description: The GetFreeInviteId method is responsible for generating a unique identifier
    that can be used to track calendar invites in the TrinityCore WoW emulator. This
    function ensures that each invite has a globally unique ID across the entire server,
    preventing conflicts when multiple players create or receive calendar events.
    The generated ID is typically used as a key in internal data structures that manage
    calendar event invitations and their associated metadata. The method maintains
    an internal counter or state to guarantee uniqueness of returned values.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing a unique identifier for a calendar invite.
    This ID should be used when creating new calendar invites to ensure they can be
    properly tracked and referenced later.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Creating Calendar Invite
    code: 'uint64 inviteId = sCalendarMgr->GetFreeInviteId();

      // Use inviteId to create a new calendar invite

      CalendarInvite invite;

      invite.SetId(inviteId);

      invite.SetEventId(eventId);

      invite.SetPlayerId(playerGuid);

      sCalendarMgr->AddInvite(&invite);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe as it's designed to be called from various
    game systems that may create calendar invites concurrently. The implementation
    likely uses atomic operations or mutex locking to maintain uniqueness across multiple
    threads.
