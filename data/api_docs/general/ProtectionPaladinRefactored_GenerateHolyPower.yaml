  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::GenerateHolyPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates holy power for the Protection Paladin based on the provided amount.
  description: The GenerateHolyPower method is responsible for increasing the holy
    power resource of a Protection Paladin character. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this method likely interacts with the player's resource management
    system to add or modify their holy power stack count. This functionality is typically
    used in response to specific abilities, talents, or gameplay events that grant
    holy power. The method accepts a uint32 parameter representing the amount of holy
    power to generate, which can be used to implement various game mechanics such
    as ability procs, talent effects, or passive resource generation.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to generate. This value must be a positive
      integer representing the number of holy power stacks to add to the player's
      current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Holy Power Generation
    code: 'ProtectionPaladinRefactored* paladin = ...;

      paladin->GenerateHolyPower(1); // Adds one holy power stack'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Holy Power Stacks
    code: 'ProtectionPaladinRefactored* paladin = ...;

      uint32 holyPowerAmount = 3;

      paladin->GenerateHolyPower(holyPowerAmount); // Adds three holy power stacks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal resource tracking systems and
    may trigger visual or auditory feedback to the player. It is expected to be called
    during ability execution or passive effects that generate holy power, such as
    using certain talents or abilities like 'Divine Purpose' or 'Shield of the Righteous'.
    The implementation should ensure proper bounds checking for maximum holy power
    values.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not exceed valid resource limits
    or cause overflow issues. Improper usage may result in incorrect resource states
    or unexpected behavior during gameplay. This method should only be called on active
    Protection Paladin instances to avoid undefined behavior.
