  signature: uint32 ObjectCache::GetAge(uint32 now) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the age of the object in seconds based on the provided
    current time.
  description: The GetAge method computes the elapsed time since the object was created
    or last updated, using the provided 'now' timestamp. It is commonly used in TrinityCore
    to manage object lifecycle, expiration, or caching behavior. The method takes
    a Unix timestamp representing the current time and returns the difference in seconds
    between that time and the object's creation or update time. This functionality
    is essential for implementing time-based systems such as temporary buffs, item
    expiration, or cache invalidation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the age of the object in seconds since
    the reference time provided in the 'now' parameter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check object age
    code: "uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);\nuint32 age = objectCache->GetAge(currentTime);\n\
      if (age > 3600) // More than 1 hour old\n{\n    // Handle expired object\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetAge for cache invalidation logic
    code: "class MyCacheEntry\n{\npublic:\n    uint32 GetAge(uint32 now) const { return\
      \ now - m_creationTime; }\nprivate:\n    uint32 m_creationTime;\n};\n\n// In\
      \ usage\nuint32 now = time(nullptr);\nMyCacheEntry entry;\nif (entry.GetAge(now)\
      \ > 1800) // 30 minutes\n{\n    // Invalidate cache entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the object's internal timestamp is properly initialized.
    It does not perform any validation on the input 'now' parameter, so callers should
    ensure it represents a valid Unix timestamp. The implementation likely relies
    on an internal stored time value (e.g., creation or last update time) to compute
    the difference.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in multi-threaded environments where
    the object's timestamp might be modified concurrently. Also, ensure that the 'now'
    parameter is not older than the stored timestamp, as it may result in unexpected
    negative values if interpreted as signed integers.
