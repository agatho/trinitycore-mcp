  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::ShouldInterrupt(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current unit should interrupt its current spell cast
    when targeting a specified unit.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates if the combat specialization of
    the current unit (typically a player or NPC) warrants interrupting an ongoing
    spell cast in response to engaging with a target unit. This method is typically
    used during combat AI logic to decide whether to break a spell that might be casting,
    such as a channeling spell or a long-duration spell, when the unit's target changes
    or when certain conditions are met. It considers factors like the type of spell
    being cast by the target and the current state of the unit performing the check.
    The method is part of the CombatSpecializationBase class which provides base functionality
    for handling combat behaviors in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that represents the target being considered
      for spell interruption. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid unit in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the current unit's combat specialization logic indicates
    that it should interrupt its current spell cast upon targeting the provided unit;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine spell interruption
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->ShouldInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n\
      \    player->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ShouldInterrupt in combat AI decision making
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n        if (ShouldInterrupt(me->GetVictim())) {\n            me->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in combat AI logic and should be called only
    when the unit is actively casting a spell. The implementation may vary based on
    subclassed specialization types, such as different warrior specializations or
    rogue abilities that affect interrupt behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. This method does not perform null checks on the target
    and assumes it is a valid Unit pointer.
