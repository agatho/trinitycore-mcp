  class: Unit
  method: setAttackTimer
  signature: void Unit::setAttackTimer(int type, uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the attack timer for a unit's melee attack.
  description: This method configures the time interval between successive melee attacks
    for a Unit, allowing control over combat timing. It is commonly used in AI scripts
    to manage attack speed and ensure proper combat behavior. The method affects the
    unit's attack timer based on the specified type and time value, which can influence
    overall combat effectiveness and performance.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of attack timer to set. Valid values are typically 0 for
      melee attacks, 1 for ranged attacks, and 2 for spell attacks.
  - name: time
    description: The time in milliseconds to set the attack timer to. This value determines
      how long to wait before the next attack occurs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->setAttackTimer(0,\
      \ 1500);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->setAttackTimer(1,\
      \ 2000);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the unit's attack timer and should be used carefully
    in AI scripts to avoid disrupting combat flow. Performance considerations include
    ensuring that the time value is appropriate for the intended combat behavior,
    as setting too low a value may cause excessive attacks or too high a value may
    result in slow combat response.
  warnings: The method should not be called during combat to avoid unexpected behavior.
    Setting incorrect timer values can lead to inconsistent combat performance and
    may affect overall game balance.
