  signature: bool ThreatReference::IsTaunting() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the threat reference is currently taunting a target.
  description: The IsTaunting method determines whether the ThreatReference object
    is actively maintaining a taunt state on its target. In World of Warcraft's combat
    system, taunting is a mechanism where a mob or player forces an enemy to attack
    them instead of their current target. This method returns true if the threat reference
    has an active taunt relationship with a target, and false otherwise. The method
    typically checks internal state flags or references to determine if taunting behavior
    is currently active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ThreatReference is currently taunting a target, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the object maintains an active taunt state with
    its assigned target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunting Check
    code: "if (threatRef.IsTaunting())\n{\n    // Handle case where threat reference\
      \ is taunting\n    sLog->outString(\"Threat reference is currently taunting.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Taunt Logic
    code: "if (!threatRef.IsTaunting())\n{\n    // Only apply taunt if not already\
      \ taunting\n    threatRef.AddThreat(target, 100.0f);\n    threatRef.SetTaunting(true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Target is already being taunted.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state flags or references rather than
    performing complex calculations. It's commonly used in AI decision-making processes
    where mobs need to determine if they're already taunting a target before applying
    new taunt effects.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only reflects the current taunt state and doesn't
    guarantee that the taunt will remain active; external factors like target switching
    or threat modifications may change the state at any time.
