  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ConfigureSession
  signature: bool BotSessionFactory::ConfigureSession(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures a new bot session with specified request parameters.
  description: The ConfigureSession method is responsible for setting up a bot session
    based on a given request configuration. It takes a shared pointer to a BotSession
    object and a reference to an integer request parameter, which likely defines the
    type or settings of the session to be created. The method returns a boolean value
    indicating whether the configuration process was successful. This function plays
    a crucial role in the bot management system by ensuring that each bot session
    is properly initialized before being used in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that needs to be configured.
      This parameter represents the session instance to be set up with appropriate
      settings.
  - name: request
    description: An integer reference that specifies the configuration request type
      or parameters for the bot session. The exact meaning of this value depends on
      the implementation and may correspond to different bot behaviors or settings.
  returns: Returns true if the session was successfully configured with the provided
    request parameters; otherwise, returns false if the configuration failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Configuration
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> botSession = std::make_shared<BotSession>();\n\
      int configRequest = 1;\nbool success = sessionFactory.ConfigureSession(botSession,\
      \ configRequest);\nif (success) {\n    // Session configured successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Configuration Failure
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> botSession = std::make_shared<BotSession>();\n\
      int configRequest = 5;\nbool success = sessionFactory.ConfigureSession(botSession,\
      \ configRequest);\nif (!success) {\n    // Handle configuration failure\n  \
      \  LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to configure bot session with request {}\", configRequest);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot
    system. The request parameter should be validated before being passed to this
    function to ensure proper behavior. It's important to note that this function
    may perform operations that could affect performance, especially if multiple sessions
    are configured simultaneously.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unsupported request value might lead to undefined
    behavior or failed configuration. Ensure the session pointer is valid and not
    null before calling this method. Improper handling of return values can cause
    issues in bot functionality.
