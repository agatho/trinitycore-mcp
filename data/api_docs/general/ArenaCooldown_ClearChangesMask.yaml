documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the arena cooldown object, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an ArenaCooldown instance. This operation typically clears any pending modifications
    or dirty flags that indicate which cooldown entries have been altered since the
    last synchronization. In the context of World of Warcraft's arena system, this
    method ensures that cooldown data is properly reset before being re-evaluated
    or saved to the database. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations, making it a simple state-reset utility.

  notes: This method should be called after processing or applying changes to ensure
    clean state management. It's commonly used in conjunction with other arena cooldown
    operations such as updating or saving cooldown data.
