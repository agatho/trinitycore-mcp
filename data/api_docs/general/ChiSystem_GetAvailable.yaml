documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available chi points for the player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the number of chi points currently
    available to the player for use with various abilities and effects. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this typically relates to the
    Monk class's chi system, where chi points are generated through specific actions
    and can be consumed to activate abilities. The returned value represents the real-time
    count of usable chi points that the player has accumulated but not yet spent.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available chi points. This value
    is typically between 0 and the maximum chi capacity (usually 6 for Monks), though
    it may temporarily exceed this in certain game states or edge cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 availableChi = player->GetCharges();\nif (availableChi > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Use chi-based ability\n    player->UseChiAbility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Chi Before Casting
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 chiAvailable = player->GetChiSystem()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (chiAvailable >= 2)\n{\n    // Cast an ability requiring 2 chi points\n \
      \   player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CHI_BURST, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Notify\
      \ player they don't have enough chi\n    player->SendNotification(\"Not enough\
      \ chi to cast this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during ability activation checks and game
    state updates. The value returned may change dynamically based on player actions,
    such as using abilities that consume chi or gaining chi through specific talents
    or effects. This method should be used in conjunction with other chi-related methods
    to fully manage the chi system.
  warnings: This method returns a snapshot of current chi points and does not account
    for pending changes or temporary modifiers. It's recommended to check this value
    before consuming chi points to prevent invalid operations. In some edge cases,
    such as during combat transitions, the returned value might not reflect immediate
    state changes.
