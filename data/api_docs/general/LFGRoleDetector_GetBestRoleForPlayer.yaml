  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: GetBestRoleForPlayer
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::GetBestRoleForPlayer(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable LFG role for a given player based
    on their class, specialization, and other relevant factors.
  description: The GetBestRoleForPlayer method evaluates a player's character data
    to determine the optimal Looking For Group (LFG) role they should be assigned.
    This includes analyzing the player's class, current specialization, gear level,
    and other gameplay attributes to recommend whether they are best suited for being
    a Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer (DPS). The method is typically used in LFG systems
    to automatically assign roles to players when forming groups, ensuring balanced
    team compositions. It considers the player's current state and game mechanics
    such as role availability and class-specific capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the recommended LFG role for the player.
    The specific values are typically defined by constants like LFG_ROLE_TANK, LFG_ROLE_HEALER,
    or LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE, though exact numeric mappings may vary based on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      uint8 bestRole = lfgRoleDetector->GetBestRoleForPlayer(player);

      // Use bestRole to assign player to appropriate group role'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on player's current
    class and specialization. It may also consider factors like item level, PvP ratings,
    or other performance metrics in more advanced implementations.
