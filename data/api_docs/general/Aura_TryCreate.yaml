  class: Aura
  method: TryCreate
  signature: Aura * Aura::TryCreate(AuraCreateInfo & createInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new Aura instance based on provided creation information
  description: The TryCreate method is responsible for generating a new Aura object
    from the given AuraCreateInfo structure. This method serves as a factory function
    that constructs an appropriate aura type based on the specified parameters and
    conditions. It handles the initialization of aura effects, duration, and other
    relevant properties required for proper gameplay mechanics. The method ensures
    that the created aura adheres to game rules and maintains consistency with existing
    aura systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: createInfo
    description: Contains the necessary information to create an aura, including effect
      type, duration, stack count, and other relevant parameters. This structure defines
      how the aura should be initialized and what properties it will have.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the newly created Aura object if successful, or nullptr
    if creation fails due to invalid parameters or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Creation
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.effect = EFFECT_0;\ncreateInfo.duration\
      \ = 30;\ncreateInfo.stackCount = 1;\nAura* aura = Aura::TryCreate(createInfo);\n\
      if (aura)\n{\n    // Use the created aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be thread-safe and should handle multiple concurrent
    calls without issues. It uses internal memory management for creating aura objects,
    ensuring proper allocation and deallocation of resources.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if the provided createInfo structure contains
    invalid or unsupported parameters, particularly when dealing with non-standard
    effects or durations. Care must be taken to ensure valid data is passed to avoid
    memory leaks or crashes.
