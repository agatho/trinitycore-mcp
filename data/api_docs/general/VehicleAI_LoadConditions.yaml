documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes vehicle conditions for the AI system
  description: The LoadConditions method is responsible for loading and setting up
    all conditional triggers and requirements that govern vehicle behavior within
    the VehicleAI system. This method typically parses condition data from database
    entries or configuration files, establishing the rules that determine when specific
    vehicle actions can be executed. It ensures that the AI has access to all necessary
    condition checks before making decisions about vehicle movement, combat behavior,
    or passenger interactions. The method is usually called during vehicle initialization
    or when the AI system is first activated.

  examples:
  - title: Basic VehicleAI Condition Loading
    code: 'VehicleAI* ai = new VehicleAI(vehicle);

      ai->LoadConditions();

      // Conditions are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called after vehicle initialization but before
    the AI begins making decisions. It may involve database queries or configuration
    file parsing, so performance considerations should be taken into account during
    server startup sequences.
