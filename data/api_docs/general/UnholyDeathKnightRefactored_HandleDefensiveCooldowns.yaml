documentation:
  brief: Handles the application and management of defensive cooldowns for the Unholy
    Death Knight AI.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing all
    defensive abilities and cooldowns specific to the Unholy Death Knight class within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates the current state of the AI's
    defensive resources, such as Death Strike, Bone Shield, and other protective abilities,
    and determines when and how to activate them based on threat levels, health status,
    and combat conditions. It ensures that defensive cooldowns are used optimally
    to maintain survivability during encounters while adhering to game mechanics and
    cooldown restrictions. The method integrates with the broader AI decision-making
    system to prioritize defensive actions over offensive ones when necessary.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ logic ...\n    HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to ensure
    proper cooldown management. It relies on internal AI state tracking and may interact
    with other defensive mechanisms such as threat management and health monitoring
    systems.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to defensive abilities
    being used inappropriately, potentially causing unnecessary resource waste or
    reduced survivability during combat encounters.
