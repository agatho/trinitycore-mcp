  method: UpdateResistances
  signature: void Guardian::UpdateResistances(uint32 school)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guardian's resistance values for the specified school.
  description: The UpdateResistances method recalculates and applies updated resistance
    values for a specific magic school to the guardian unit. This method is typically
    invoked when the guardian's stats, buffs, or debuffs change, ensuring that its
    damage reduction properties are accurately reflected in combat calculations. The
    method operates on the specified school of magic resistance and may affect the
    guardian's overall combat effectiveness against different spell types.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: 'The magic school index (0-6) for which resistances should be updated.
      Valid values are: 0=Physical, 1=Holy, 2=Fire, 3=Nature, 4=Frost, 5=Shadow, 6=Arcane.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Fire Resistance
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateResistances(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update All Resistances
    code: "Guardian* guardian = ...;\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < MAX_SPELL_SCHOOL; ++i)\n\
      {\n    guardian->UpdateResistances(i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers recalculations of the guardian's total resistance
    values based on base stats, buffs, and any applicable modifiers. It may also update
    the unit's combat state or send updates to clients in multiplayer environments.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid school indices (outside 0-6) may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect resistance calculations. Ensure that the guardian
    object is properly initialized before calling this method.
