documentation:
  brief: Initializes all cooldowns for the Unholy Death Knight specialization
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for abilities specific to the Unholy Death Knight class. This method is
    typically called during player initialization or when switching to the Unholy
    specialization. It ensures that all abilities start with their correct base cooldown
    values, preventing any unexpected behavior where abilities might be immediately
    available or incorrectly delayed. The method handles internal state management
    for cooldowns and prepares the death knight's ability system for gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = new UnholyDeathKnightRefactored();

      dk->InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the class initialization phase.
    Repeated calls may result in unexpected cooldown behavior or state corruption.
    The implementation relies on internal ability data structures that must be properly
    set up before this method is invoked.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper initialization sequence.
    Calling it multiple times can lead to incorrect cooldown states and potential
    gameplay bugs. This method modifies internal cooldown timers and should only be
    used during class setup or specialization switching.
