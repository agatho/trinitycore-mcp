documentation:
  brief: Returns the legacy raid difficulty ID for the player's current instance
  description: This method retrieves the legacy raid difficulty identifier that corresponds
    to the player's current raid instance. The value returned represents the specific
    difficulty level of the raid content, which is used for determining access to
    certain content and mechanics within the game. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with other raid-related functions to manage player progression and
    content access. The returned value is consistent across all players in the same
    raid instance but may vary between different instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the legacy raid difficulty ID, which corresponds
    to the current raid instance's difficulty level. Possible values include 0 for
    normal difficulty, 1 for heroic difficulty, and 2 for mythic difficulty. The value
    is determined by the game's internal raid difficulty system and may be used for
    various gameplay mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int difficulty = player->GetLegacyRaidDifficultyID();\nif (difficulty ==\
      \ 1)\n{\n    // Player is in heroic raid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the legacy raid system and may not be used in newer
    content. The value returned is consistent with the player's current instance,
    but may change when entering different raid instances. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple getter function.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine player progression or content
    access for modern content, as it relates to legacy systems. The value returned
    may not reflect the actual difficulty level of the current instance if the game
    has been updated.
