  brief: Learn passive spell from a given spell info
  description: The HandlePassiveSpellLearn method is responsible for applying passive
    spells to a player character. It takes a pointer to spell information and attempts
    to add the specified passive spell to the player's spell book, ensuring that the
    spell is properly registered and active within the game mechanics. This method
    typically handles the logic for passive spell acquisition, including checking
    if the spell is already learned, and updating the player's spell list accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell was successfully learned, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the spell is already learned or if there are issues
    with spell validation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = new Player();\nint spellInfo[] = {12345};\nbool result\
      \ = player->HandlePassiveSpellLearn(spellInfo);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Spell\
      \ successfully learned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell learning mechanisms.
    It may involve checking for existing spell knowledge and updating player's spell
    list. Performance considerations include the need to validate spell data before
    applying it.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper validation of
    spell information. Incorrect spell data can lead to game mechanics issues or errors.
