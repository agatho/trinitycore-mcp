  brief: Moves the player to a specified position in the world.
  description: The MoveToPosition method is used to teleport or move a player character
    to a predefined position within the game world. This method typically handles
    the logic for updating the player's coordinates and notifying the client of the
    new location. It may be invoked during quest progression, instance teleportation,
    or other gameplay events where character positioning needs to be adjusted. The
    method operates on a positional index that corresponds to a known location in
    the game world's coordinate system.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a predefined position in the game
      world. This value typically maps to an entry in a position database or lookup
      table within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToPosition

      PositionManager* posMgr = player->GetPositionManager();

      posMgr->MoveToPosition(42); // Teleports player to position index 42'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a client-side update and may involve server-client
    synchronization. It's important to ensure that the provided position index is
    valid to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Using an invalid position index could lead to unexpected behavior, including
    potential client disconnections or game state corruption. Always validate input
    parameters before calling this method.
