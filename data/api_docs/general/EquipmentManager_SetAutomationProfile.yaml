  class: EquipmentManager
  method: SetAutomationProfile
  signature: void EquipmentManager::SetAutomationProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const
    EquipmentAutomationProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the equipment automation profile for a specified player.
  description: The SetAutomationProfile method assigns a given EquipmentAutomationProfile
    to a player identified by their GUID. This profile defines how the player's equipment
    should be automatically managed, such as which items to equip based on combat
    role or gear specialization. The method typically updates internal player state
    and may trigger UI refreshes or gear change events. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with automation systems that manage character loadouts dynamically during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose equipment automation
      profile will be set. Must correspond to an active player in the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: The EquipmentAutomationProfile object containing the rules and preferences
      for automatic equipment management. This includes item slot mappings, gear priorities,
      and specialization settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EquipmentAutomationProfile profile;

      profile.SetSlotPreference(EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND, 12345);

      profile.SetSlotPreference(EQUIPMENT_SLOT_OFFHAND, 67890);

      equipmentManager->SetAutomationProfile(123456789, profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and may synchronize with
    the client-side UI. It is recommended to call this method only when the player
    is in a stable game state to avoid conflicts with ongoing gear changes or combat
    actions.
  warnings: Modifying automation profiles while a player is actively engaged in combat
    or during a gear swap sequence can lead to inconsistent behavior or UI glitches.
    Ensure that profile updates are performed during safe transitions such as zoning,
    resting, or after combat ends.
