  brief: Sends the player's equipment set list to the client
  description: This method sends the complete list of equipment sets that a player
    has saved in their character. The equipment set list includes all the sets the
    player has created, which can be used for quick switching between different gear
    configurations during gameplay. This method is typically called when a player
    logs in or when the player's equipment set information needs to be refreshed in
    the client UI. It ensures that the player's saved equipment sets are properly
    synchronized with the game client.

    client. It's typically called automatically during login or when equipment set
    data needs to be refreshed, but can also be manually invoked by developers for
    specific scenarios.
