  class: GuildIntegration
  method: WelcomeNewGuildMembers
  signature: void GuildIntegration::WelcomeNewGuildMembers(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Welcomes new guild members by sending them a greeting message and initializing
    their guild integration status.
  description: The WelcomeNewGuildMembers method is responsible for handling the initial
    integration process for players who have recently joined a guild. This method
    sends a welcome message to the player, initializes their guild-related data structures,
    and sets up any necessary tracking or notifications within the guild system. It
    typically gets invoked when a new member accepts an invitation to join a guild,
    ensuring they are properly integrated into the guild's communication and activity
    systems. The method operates on the player identifier passed as a parameter, which
    should represent the unique character ID of the newly joined member.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the player who is being welcomed into the guild. This value must be a valid
      player GUID or the method may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.WelcomeNewGuildMembers(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guild Join Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerGuildJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    int guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.WelcomeNewGuildMembers(&guid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's data is already loaded and valid in
    the database. It does not perform any validation on the input GUID, so calling
    it with an invalid or uninitialized value could lead to memory corruption or unexpected
    behavior. The actual welcome message content and initialization logic are likely
    defined elsewhere in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the player has been properly
    added to the guild database entry first. Passing a null pointer for the player
    parameter will result in a crash. Avoid calling this method multiple times for
    the same player to prevent duplicate welcome messages or data inconsistencies.
