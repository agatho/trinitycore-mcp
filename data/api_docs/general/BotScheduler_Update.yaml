  class: BotScheduler
  method: Update
  signature: void BotScheduler::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot scheduler's internal state and processes scheduled bot actions
    based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal timer of
    the BotScheduler and executing any pending bot-related tasks or actions that are
    due for execution. This method is typically called from the game loop at regular
    intervals, using a delta time value (diff) to determine how much time has passed
    since the last update. It ensures that bots perform their scheduled activities
    such as movement, combat decisions, or interaction with the environment in a timely
    manner. The method does not return any value and modifies the internal state of
    the scheduler.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last call to Update.
      This value is used to determine which scheduled tasks should be executed based
      on their timing requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    botScheduler.Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore's main update loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    sBotScheduler->Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Additional world updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper scheduling and execution of bot behaviors. It is designed to be
    efficient and avoid blocking the main thread, as it typically only processes tasks
    that are due for execution at the current time.
