  class: PriestAI
  method: ShouldConserveMana
  signature: bool PriestAI::ShouldConserveMana()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the priest should conserve mana during combat.
  description: The ShouldConserveMana method evaluates the current mana level and
    combat situation of the priest AI to decide if it should prioritize mana conservation
    over aggressive spell casting. This decision is typically based on factors such
    as remaining mana percentage, available spell resources, and the threat level
    or duration of combat. The method helps optimize resource usage for sustained
    battles by avoiding unnecessary spell casting when mana is low. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other AI decision-making logic to balance damage output
    with mana sustainability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the priest AI should conserve mana, indicating that aggressive
    spell casting should be reduced or avoided to preserve mana for more critical
    moments; returns false otherwise, allowing normal spell casting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (priestAI->ShouldConserveMana()) {\n    // Reduce aggressive spell usage\n\
      \    priestAI->SetSpellPriority(SPELL_PRIORITY_CONSERVATIVE);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Allow normal spell casting\n    priestAI->SetSpellPriority(SPELL_PRIORITY_NORMAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Priest AI's resource management system and integrates
    with TrinityCore's combat and mana tracking systems. It may be called frequently
    during combat updates, so performance should be considered when implementing custom
    logic.
