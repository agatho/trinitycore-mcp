  method: GetDestination
  signature: bool MotionMaster::GetDestination(float & x, float & y, float & z)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current destination coordinates of the motion master.
  description: This method retrieves the x, y, and z coordinates of the current destination
    that the motion master is moving towards. It returns true if a valid destination
    exists and false if no destination is set or the motion master is in a state where
    no destination can be retrieved. The method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts
    to determine the target location for movement calculations, particularly when
    implementing pathfinding or movement logic within the World of Warcraft client.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid destination coordinates are available and false
    if no destination exists or the motion master is in an invalid state. The method
    populates the provided float references with the x, y, and z coordinates when
    successful.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float x, y, z;\nif (motionMaster->GetDestination(x, y, z))\n{\n    // Use\
      \ destination coordinates for movement\n    // Do something with x, y, z\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // No destination set\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other motion-related methods
    to manage AI behavior. It's important to note that the coordinates returned are
    not necessarily the final destination but rather the current target point during
    movement. The method may return false if the motion master has no active movement
    or if it's currently idle.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods, as it might return false if the motion master is in a state where no
    destination is set. Also note that this method does not account for dynamic pathfinding
    or obstacle avoidance; it simply returns the last known destination coordinates.
