  class: WarriorAI
  method: OptimizeMobility
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeMobility(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the warrior's mobility based on target positioning and combat state.
  description: The OptimizeMobility method adjusts a warrior AI's movement behavior
    to enhance tactical positioning during combat. It evaluates the current target's
    location, distance, and threat level to determine optimal movement patterns such
    as closing range, maintaining distance, or repositioning for better attack angles.
    This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to dynamically adapt
    the warrior's positioning strategy based on evolving battlefield conditions. The
    function considers factors like target mobility, available cover, and the warrior's
    own combat abilities to make intelligent positioning decisions that improve overall
    effectiveness in battle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    if (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n        OptimizeMobility(victim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI class's tactical decision-making system
    and should be called regularly during combat updates. It does not directly control
    movement commands but rather influences the AI's positioning strategy that may
    subsequently affect movement behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method assumes the warrior
    has a valid combat target and may produce unexpected results if called without
    an active threat situation.
