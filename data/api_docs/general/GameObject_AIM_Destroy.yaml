documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GameObject's AI system and releases associated resources.
  description: The AIM_Destroy method is responsible for cleaning up and destroying
    the AI component of a GameObject instance. This method ensures that all AI-related
    data structures, memory allocations, and references are properly released to prevent
    memory leaks and maintain game stability. It typically gets called during object
    destruction or when transitioning the GameObject's AI state. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return operations. It is part of the internal
    GameObject AI management system in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in GameObject Destruction
    code: "void MyGameObject::OnDeath()\n{\n    // Perform death logic\n    AIM_Destroy();\
      \ // Clean up AI resources\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the GameObject's AI system is no longer
    needed. Calling it prematurely may result in undefined behavior if other systems
    still reference the AI components. The destruction process is typically handled
    automatically by the game engine during object cleanup.
  warnings: Do not call AIM_Destroy() on a GameObject that is still actively referenced
    by other systems, as this can lead to dangling pointers and memory corruption.
    Ensure all AI-related operations are completed before invoking this method.
