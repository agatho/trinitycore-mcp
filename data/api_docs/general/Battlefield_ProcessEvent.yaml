  class: Battlefield
  method: ProcessEvent
  signature: void Battlefield::ProcessEvent(int * target, int eventId, int * invoker)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an event within the battlefield, handling target and invoker interactions
    based on event ID.
  description: The ProcessEvent method is responsible for executing specific actions
    or behaviors within a Battlefield instance when a particular event occurs. It
    takes in a target pointer, an event identifier, and an invoker pointer to determine
    how the event should be processed. This method is typically invoked during battlefield
    operations such as capturing objectives, handling player interactions, or triggering
    dynamic events. The method modifies the state of the battlefield based on the
    provided parameters and event type. It's designed to integrate with the broader
    battlefield management system and may trigger additional callbacks or updates
    depending on the event context.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity affected by
      the event. This could be a player, NPC, or object ID within the battlefield
      context.
  - name: eventId
    description: Integer identifier that specifies which type of event is being processed.
      This determines the behavior and logic executed within the method.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the entity that triggered or invoked
      the event, such as a player or game object.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void example()\n{\n    int targetId = 12345;\n    int eventId = 1001;\n\
      \    int invokerId = 67890;\n    \n    Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1);\n\
      \    if (bf)\n        bf->ProcessEvent(&targetId, eventId, &invokerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core battlefield event handling system and should
    be called only when a valid battlefield instance exists. The parameters are expected
    to point to valid integer identifiers that represent entities within the game
    world.
  warnings: Incorrect eventId values may lead to undefined behavior or failed event
    processing. Ensure that target and invoker pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid memory access violations.
