  class: HostileEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void HostileEventBus::Unsubscribe(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all hostile event subscriptions for the specified zone ID from the
    event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes all registered hostile event listeners
    associated with a given zone ID from the HostileEventBus. This method is typically
    used when a zone becomes inactive or when cleanup is required to prevent memory
    leaks or unwanted event processing. The operation ensures that no further hostile
    events will be dispatched to subscribers for the specified zone, effectively detaching
    them from the event system. It's important to note that this method operates on
    a zone-level granularity, meaning all subscriptions within that zone are removed
    at once.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which all hostile event subscriptions
      should be removed. This ID corresponds to a specific in-game zone or area where
      hostile events may have been subscribed to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: HostileEventBus::Unsubscribe(1234); // Removes all hostile event subscriptions
      for zone ID 1234
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribe in Zone Cleanup
    code: "void OnZoneDeactivate(uint32 zoneId)\n{\n    HostileEventBus::Unsubscribe(zoneId);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the zone ID passed is valid and corresponds to an
    existing zone in the game world. The implementation likely uses internal data
    structures such as hash maps or lists to track subscriptions, and this operation
    may involve iterating through those collections to find matching entries. It's
    recommended to call this method during zone deactivation or when cleaning up resources
    associated with a particular zone.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with an invalid or non-existent zone ID might lead
    to undefined behavior if the underlying implementation does not perform validation
    checks. Additionally, if other systems depend on events from this zone, removing
    all subscriptions could cause unexpected gameplay behavior or missing event handling.
