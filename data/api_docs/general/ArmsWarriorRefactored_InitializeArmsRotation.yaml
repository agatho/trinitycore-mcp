documentation:
  brief: Initializes the arms warrior's rotation logic and combat state.
  description: The InitializeArmsRotation method sets up the initial configuration
    and state for an arms warrior's combat rotation. This includes initializing key
    variables, setting up combat behavior flags, configuring ability priorities, and
    preparing the AI to execute the appropriate rotation sequence. The method ensures
    that all necessary data structures are properly initialized before the warrior
    begins engaging in combat. It typically runs once during the initialization phase
    of a combat encounter or when a new arms warrior AI instance is created.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ArmsWarriorRefactored warrior;

      warrior.InitializeArmsRotation();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of an arms
    warrior AI instance. It is typically invoked automatically by the core TrinityCore
    framework when a new warrior NPC or player character enters combat mode with the
    arms specialization.
