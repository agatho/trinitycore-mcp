  class: CastSpellExtraArgs
  method: SetCastItem
  signature: CastSpellExtraArgs & CastSpellExtraArgs::SetCastItem(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cast item for a spell casting context and returns a reference to
    the same CastSpellExtraArgs object for chaining.
  description: The SetCastItem method assigns an Item pointer to the CastSpellExtraArgs
    object, which is used to specify the item that triggered or is associated with
    a spell cast. This is commonly used in spell systems where items such as wands,
    staves, or other enchanted objects influence how spells are executed. The method
    supports method chaining by returning a reference to the same CastSpellExtraArgs
    instance, allowing multiple setter calls to be combined in a single statement.
    This functionality is particularly relevant in TrinityCore's spell handling system
    where item-based spell casting requires explicit context about the source item.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the CastSpellExtraArgs object, enabling method chaining
    for subsequent configuration of spell casting parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with Method Chaining
    code: 'Item* wand = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);

      CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetCastItem(wand).SetCastTarget(target);

      spell->Cast(args);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Cast Item for Enchanted Weapon Spell
    code: "if (Item* weapon = player->GetWeaponForAttack(BASE_ATTACK)) {\n    CastSpellExtraArgs\
      \ args;\n    args.SetCastItem(weapon);\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENCHANTED_WEAPON_SPELL,\
      \ &args);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided Item pointer is valid
    or of a type that supports spell casting. It is the caller's responsibility to
    ensure the item is appropriate for the intended spell context. The returned reference
    allows for fluent interface patterns but should be used carefully to avoid unintended
    side effects in complex spell systems.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes during spell execution. Ensure that all items passed are properly initialized
    and exist in the player's inventory before calling this method.
