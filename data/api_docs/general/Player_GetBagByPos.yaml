  class: Player
  method: GetBagByPos
  signature: Bag * Player::GetBagByPos(uint8 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bag object located at the specified slot position.
  description: The GetBagByPos method retrieves a Bag object from the player's inventory
    based on the provided slot position. This method is commonly used to access specific
    bags within the player's inventory, particularly when dealing with bag slots that
    are not directly accessible through other means. The method operates on the principle
    that each bag slot corresponds to a specific position in the player's inventory,
    and it returns a pointer to the Bag object at that location. It is important to
    note that this method does not perform any validation checks on the slot parameter,
    which could lead to undefined behavior if an invalid slot is provided.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot position within the player's inventory where the bag is
      located. This is typically a value between 0 and 36, representing different
      bag slots in the inventory.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Bag object at the specified slot position. If
    the slot is invalid or no bag exists at that position, the method may return nullptr,
    indicating that no bag was found at the given slot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Bag* bag = player->GetBagByPos(0);\nif (bag != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ bag\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with inventory slot validation
    code: "uint8 slot = 5;\nBag* bag = player->GetBagByPos(slot);\nif (bag != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Check if bag is valid\n    if (bag->GetSlot() == slot)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Proceed with bag operations\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly accesses the player's
    inventory. The method does not perform any bounds checking, so invalid slot values
    may result in memory access violations or undefined behavior. Developers should
    ensure that slot values are within valid ranges before calling this method.
  warnings: Using invalid slot values can lead to memory corruption or crashes. Always
    validate slot parameters before calling this method. This method is not thread-safe
    and should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
