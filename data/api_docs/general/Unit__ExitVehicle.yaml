  method: _ExitVehicle
  signature: void Unit::_ExitVehicle(const int * exitPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Exits the vehicle the unit is currently in and returns to normal movement
    state.
  description: This method handles the process of exiting a vehicle that a Unit object
    is currently occupying. It removes the unit from the vehicle's passenger list
    and restores normal movement behavior, allowing the unit to move freely again.
    The method typically occurs when a player or creature is no longer mounted on
    a vehicle, or when the vehicle is removed from the game world. This action is
    essential for maintaining proper game mechanics and preventing issues with movement
    and positioning.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetVehicleBase();

      unit->_ExitVehicle();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is actually inside a vehicle.
    Calling it on units not in vehicles may cause undefined behavior or crashes. The
    method internally handles cleanup of vehicle-related data and ensures proper movement
    restoration.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if the unit is in a vehicle can lead
    to crashes or invalid memory access. Always verify that the unit is currently
    occupying a vehicle before calling this method.
