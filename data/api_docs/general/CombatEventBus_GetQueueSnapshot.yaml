  method: GetQueueSnapshot
  signature: int CombatEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of events queued for processing in the combat
    event bus.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method provides a snapshot of the current size
    of the combat event queue within the CombatEventBus. This method is typically
    used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand how many combat-related
    events are currently waiting to be processed. The returned value represents the
    count of events in the internal queue at the time of the call, which can help
    developers assess system load or identify potential bottlenecks in combat processing.
    The method does not modify any state within the CombatEventBus and is safe to
    call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of events currently queued for processing
    in the CombatEventBus. A return value of zero indicates no pending events, while
    a positive integer indicates the count of queued events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int queueSize = combatEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queueSize > 100)\n\
      {\n    // Log warning about high combat event queue\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Combat event queue size: %d\", queueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Queue Size for Performance
    code: "void MonitorCombatSystem()\n{\n    int snapshot = sCombatEventBus->GetQueueSnapshot();\n\
      \    if (snapshot > 500)\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"High combat queue\
      \ load detected: %d events\", snapshot);\n        // Potentially trigger performance\
      \ optimizations or alerts\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a non-blocking read operation on the queue size. The
    returned value is a snapshot and may not reflect real-time changes in the queue
    size. For high-frequency monitoring, consider caching the result or using this
    method sparingly to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: The returned queue size does not indicate the priority or type of events
    in the queue. It only provides a count, so developers should not assume that all
    queued events are equally important for processing. Additionally, calling this
    method frequently in tight loops may introduce unnecessary overhead.
