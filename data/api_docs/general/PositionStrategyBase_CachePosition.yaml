  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CachePosition
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::CachePosition(Player * bot, Unit * target,
    const int & pos, float score)
documentation:
  brief: Caches a calculated position for a bot relative to a target unit with an
    associated score.
  description: The CachePosition method stores a computed position for a bot in relation
    to a target unit, along with a score that represents the desirability or suitability
    of that position. This is typically used in AI pathfinding and positioning strategies
    where multiple potential positions are evaluated and ranked. The cached position
    can later be retrieved by other methods in the strategy to make decisions about
    movement or targeting. The method does not perform any validation on input parameters,
    so it's expected that the caller ensures valid Player and Unit pointers are provided.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose position
      is being cached.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the reference point for
      calculating the position.
  - name: pos
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific position index or slot
      in which to cache the calculated position.
  - name: score
    description: Floating-point value indicating the score or priority of this cached
      position, used for comparison with other positions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      Player* bot = ...; // Valid player pointer

      Unit* target = ...; // Valid unit pointer

      int positionIndex = 0;

      float scoreValue = 85.3f;

      strategy.CachePosition(bot, target, positionIndex, scoreValue);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Multiple Positions
    code: "PositionStrategyBase strategy;\nPlayer* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    float score = 100.0f - (i * 10.0f);\n  \
      \  strategy.CachePosition(bot, target, i, score);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a positioning strategy system and likely used in conjunction
    with other methods like GetCachedPosition or ClearCache. It's important to ensure
    that the 'pos' parameter corresponds to valid indices within the internal cache
    structure, otherwise behavior may be undefined. The score value can be interpreted
    differently depending on the implementing subclass.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for bot or target will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the position index is within expected bounds
    to prevent memory corruption or access violations.
