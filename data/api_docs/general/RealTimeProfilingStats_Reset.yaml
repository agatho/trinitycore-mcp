  signature: void RealTimeProfilingStats::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all real-time profiling statistics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated profiling data within the RealTimeProfilingStats
    object, restoring it to its default condition. This method is typically used to
    start a fresh profiling session or to clear previous measurements before beginning
    new performance analysis. The reset operation ensures that subsequent profiling
    measurements are not influenced by prior data, making it essential for accurate
    performance monitoring in TrinityCore's real-time profiling system.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'RealTimeProfilingStats stats;

      stats.Reset(); // Clears all profiling data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before New Profiling Session
    code: 'RealTimeProfilingStats profiler;

      // ... perform some profiling ...

      profiler.Reset(); // Prepare for new profiling session

      // ... begin new profiling measurements ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an in-place reset of all internal counters and timers
    without deallocating memory. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, suitable
    for use during active server operation. The reset operation does not affect the
    object's state beyond clearing profiling data.
