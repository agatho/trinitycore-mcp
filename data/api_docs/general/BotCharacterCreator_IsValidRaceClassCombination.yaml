api:
  class: BotCharacterCreator
  method: IsValidRaceClassCombination
  signature: bool BotCharacterCreator::IsValidRaceClassCombination(uint8 race, uint8
    classId)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given race and class combination is allowed for bot character
    creation in World of Warcraft.
  description: The IsValidRaceClassCombination method checks if a specified race and
    class pair is a valid combination for creating bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This validation ensures that only officially supported race-class combinations
    are permitted, preventing invalid or unsupported character configurations. The
    method likely references internal game data tables or configuration settings to
    determine valid combinations based on World of Warcraft's character creation rules.
    It serves as a crucial validation step in the bot character creation process to
    maintain game integrity and prevent errors during character initialization.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier (uint8) to validate against the class. Valid
      values typically correspond to World of Warcraft race constants such as Human
      (1), Orc (2), Dwarf (3), etc.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier (uint8) to validate against the race. Valid
      values typically correspond to World of Warcraft class constants such as Warrior
      (1), Paladin (2), Hunter (3), etc.
  returns: Returns true if the specified race and class combination is valid for bot
    character creation, false otherwise. Invalid combinations may include unsupported
    race-class pairs or combinations that are disabled in the current game configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of a human warrior
    code: 'BotCharacterCreator creator;

      bool isValid = creator.IsValidRaceClassCombination(1, 1); // Human (1) + Warrior
      (1)

      // Returns true if this combination is valid'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking invalid race-class combination
    code: 'BotCharacterCreator creator;

      bool isValid = creator.IsValidRaceClassCombination(7, 3); // Blood Elf (7) +
      Hunter (3)

      // Returns false if this specific combination is not supported for bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs fast lookup operations using precomputed tables
    or bitmasks to determine valid combinations. The implementation may cache results
    or use optimized data structures for performance. Developers should be aware that
    the validity of race-class combinations can change based on game patches, expansions,
    or server configurations.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters (uint8 values). Passing invalid
    race or class identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect validation
    results. Ensure that race and class values are within expected ranges before calling
    this method.
