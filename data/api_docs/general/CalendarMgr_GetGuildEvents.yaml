  signature: CalendarEventStore CalendarMgr::GetGuildEvents(int guildId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all calendar events associated with a specified guild.
  description: The GetGuildEvents method fetches a collection of calendar events that
    are linked to a particular guild identified by its unique identifier. This function
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's calendar system, where
    guilds can schedule and manage events such as raids, guild meetings, or social
    gatherings. The returned CalendarEventStore contains all relevant event data for
    the specified guild, including event details like title, description, date/time,
    and organizer information. This method does not modify any state and is read-only
    in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CalendarEventStore object containing all calendar events associated with
    the specified guild. If no events exist for the guild, an empty store will be
    returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Guild Events
    code: "CalendarEventStore events = sCalendarMgr->GetGuildEvents(12345);\nfor (auto&\
      \ event : events)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event: \" << event->GetTitle() << \"\
      \ at \" << event->GetEventTime() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the calendar database to retrieve guild-specific events.
    It may involve database queries and should be used judiciously in performance-critical
    code paths. The returned CalendarEventStore is a container that holds pointers
    to CalendarEvent objects, so care must be taken when modifying or deleting these
    events.
