  class: PathGenerator
  method: GetPathType
  signature: PathType PathGenerator::GetPathType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the path type currently set for this path generator instance.
  description: The GetPathType method retrieves the PathType enumeration value that
    defines the type of path calculation or navigation behavior currently configured
    for the PathGenerator object. This is used internally by the TrinityCore AI and
    movement systems to determine how a unit should navigate through the world, such
    as whether it's using direct pathfinding, fly paths, or other specialized movement
    types. The returned value influences how movement updates are processed and which
    pathfinding algorithms are applied during unit navigation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PathType enumeration value indicating the current path type configuration.
    Possible values include but are not limited to PATH_TYPE_NORMAL, PATH_TYPE_FLY,
    PATH_TYPE_SWIM, and PATH_TYPE_GROUND, each representing different movement capabilities
    and navigation behaviors for units in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Path Type Before Movement
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\n// Assume pathGen has been initialized with a valid\
      \ path\nPathType type = pathGen.GetPathType();\nif (type == PATH_TYPE_FLY)\n\
      {\n    // Handle flying movement logic\n    unit->SetCanFly(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement updates to determine the
    appropriate navigation behavior. The PathType affects how pathfinding calculations
    are performed and which movement flags are set on the unit. It's important to
    note that this value may change dynamically based on environmental conditions
    or unit state changes.
