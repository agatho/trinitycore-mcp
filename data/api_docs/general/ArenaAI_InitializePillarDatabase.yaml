  signature: void ArenaAI::InitializePillarDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the pillar database for arena AI behavior.
  description: The InitializePillarDatabase method sets up internal data structures
    used by the ArenaAI class to manage and track pillar positions within an arena
    environment. This method is typically called during the initialization phase of
    an arena combat scenario to ensure that the AI has access to accurate spatial
    data about the arena's layout, particularly regarding pillar placements that can
    affect movement, positioning, and tactical decisions. It prepares the AI for engaging
    in structured combat where environmental elements like pillars play a role in
    determining optimal strategies.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ArenaAI* arenaAI = new ArenaAI();

      arenaAI->InitializePillarDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the setup phase of an arena
    instance. Reinitializing the database may lead to inconsistent behavior or memory
    leaks if not handled carefully.
