  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: IdentifyDangerZones
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::IdentifyDangerZones(Unit * target, CombatPositionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes target unit to identify dangerous areas in combat positioning.
  description: The IdentifyDangerZones method evaluates the current combat context
    and target unit to determine potential danger zones that could affect positioning
    decisions. It analyzes threat levels, aggro distribution, and environmental factors
    to mark areas where the unit might be at risk. This method is typically used by
    role-based AI systems to make informed decisions about movement and positioning
    during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      Must not be null for valid operation.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing current
      combat state and positioning data. Updated with identified danger zones during
      execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      CombatPositionContext context;

      roleBasedCombatPositioning->IdentifyDangerZones(target, context);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with positioning logic
    code: "void CombatAI::UpdatePositioning()\n{\n    Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (!target)\n        return;\n    \n    CombatPositionContext context;\n\
      \    context.currentPosition = me->GetPosition();\n    context.threatLevel =\
      \ GetThreatLevel(target);\n    \n    roleBasedCombatPositioning->IdentifyDangerZones(target,\
      \ context);\n    \n    if (context.dangerZones.empty())\n        MoveToOptimalPosition();\n\
      \    else\n        AvoidDangerZones(context.dangerZones);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the provided CombatPositionContext object by populating
    its dangerZones member with calculated threat areas. The implementation likely
    uses proximity checks, threat calculations, and environmental analysis to determine
    danger zones. Performance may be impacted during high-threat encounters with multiple
    targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. The context object should be properly initialized before passing
    it to avoid undefined behavior. This method assumes the unit has a valid combat
    state and should not be called outside of active combat scenarios.
