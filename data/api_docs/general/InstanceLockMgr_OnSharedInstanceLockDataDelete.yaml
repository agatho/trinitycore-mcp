  method: OnSharedInstanceLockDataDelete
  signature: void InstanceLockMgr::OnSharedInstanceLockDataDelete(uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes shared instance lock data for the specified instance ID from the
    manager's internal storage.
  description: The OnSharedInstanceLockDataDelete method is responsible for cleaning
    up and removing shared instance lock data associated with a given instance identifier.
    This typically occurs when an instance is no longer in use or has been properly
    closed, ensuring that stale lock information does not persist in memory. The method
    likely interacts with internal data structures such as maps or caches that track
    active instance locks. It is part of the InstanceLockMgr class's management functionality
    and is crucial for maintaining accurate state tracking across shared instances
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Deleting Lock Data for a Specific Instance
    code: InstanceLockMgr::instance().OnSharedInstanceLockDataDelete(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when it's safe to remove lock data, typically
    after verifying that no players or processes are still using the instance. The
    implementation may involve thread synchronization to ensure safe removal in a
    multi-threaded environment.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation can lead to inconsistent
    state if other systems are still referencing the deleted instance lock data. Ensure
    all related locks and references are properly released before invoking this function.
