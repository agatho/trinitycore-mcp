  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeDecisionPatterns()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and logs AI decision-making patterns for performance evaluation
    and optimization.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionPatterns method processes collected data from AI
    behavior profiling to identify recurring decision patterns, execution times, and
    potential bottlenecks in NPC or creature AI logic. This method is typically invoked
    during profiling sessions or performance analysis phases to generate insights
    into how AI entities make choices under various conditions. It aggregates timing
    data, decision frequency, and outcome distributions to provide actionable metrics
    for developers working on AI behavior tuning within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not modify any game state but instead focuses on gathering and
    processing analytical data for reporting purposes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Context
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.AnalyzeDecisionPatterns(); // Triggers analysis of collected AI decision
      data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after sufficient AI behavior data has been
    collected via other profiling mechanisms. It is designed to be non-intrusive and
    does not affect real-time gameplay performance. The analysis results are typically
    logged or stored for later review by developers.
  warnings: Ensure that AI profiling data collection is enabled before calling this
    method, otherwise the analysis may produce empty or incomplete results. Avoid
    invoking this during high-frequency gameplay events to prevent potential performance
    degradation.
