  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetShape(const AreaTriggerShapeInfo & shape)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the shape configuration for this area trigger, defining its geometric
    properties and behavior.
  description: The SetShape method configures the geometric shape and associated parameters
    of an AreaTrigger object. This method is used to define how the area trigger behaves
    in the game world, including its dimensions, orientation, and collision properties.
    The shape information is typically provided through an AreaTriggerShapeInfo structure
    that contains details such as radius, height, rotation, and other relevant geometric
    data. This configuration directly affects how players interact with the area trigger,
    determining when and how enter/exit events are triggered. The method should be
    called during the initialization or modification of area triggers to ensure proper
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: shape
    description: A const reference to an AreaTriggerShapeInfo structure containing
      the geometric configuration for this area trigger, including radius, height,
      rotation, and other shape-specific parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a circular area trigger shape
    code: 'AreaTriggerShapeInfo shape;

      shape.radius = 5.0f;

      shape.height = 10.0f;

      shape.rotation = 0.0f;

      areaTrigger->SetShape(shape);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a rectangular area trigger shape
    code: 'AreaTriggerShapeInfo shape;

      shape.type = AreaTriggerShapeType::RECTANGLE;

      shape.length = 20.0f;

      shape.width = 15.0f;

      shape.height = 8.0f;

      areaTrigger->SetShape(shape);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates the internal shape configuration of the area trigger
    and may affect existing active triggers. Changes to the shape should be made before
    the area trigger becomes active in the game world for optimal behavior. The AreaTriggerShapeInfo
    structure is expected to contain valid geometric parameters to prevent undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetShape on an active area trigger may cause unexpected behavior
    or visual glitches. Ensure that all required shape parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method. Avoid setting invalid geometric values (like negative
    radii) which could lead to client-side issues or crashes.
