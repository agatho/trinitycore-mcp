api:
  class: Player
  method: GetGroupInvite
  signature: Group * Player::GetGroupInvite() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group invitation that the player is currently receiving.
  description: This method retrieves the Group object that represents the invitation
    the player is currently receiving. It is used to determine if a player has an
    active group invitation, typically from another player or from a group leader.
    The method returns NULL if no group invitation exists, and can be used to check
    for pending group invites before accepting or rejecting them. This functionality
    is essential for managing group invitations in World of Warcraft's group system
    and is often used in conjunction with other group-related methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Group object representing the invitation, or NULL
    if no invitation exists. The returned Group object may be valid or invalid depending
    on whether the player has accepted or rejected the invitation.
  examples:
  - title: Check for group invitation before accepting
    code: "if (Group* group = player->GetGroupInvite()) {\n    // Player has a pending\
      \ group invitation\n    // Do something with the group\n}\nelse {\n    // No\
      \ group invitation exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's internal group management system and
    should be used carefully to avoid race conditions. The returned Group object may
    not be valid if the invitation has been accepted or rejected, so developers should
    ensure proper handling of the returned pointer.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can lead to race conditions if
    not properly synchronized with other group-related methods. Also, the returned
    pointer might be invalid if the player has already accepted or rejected the invitation.
