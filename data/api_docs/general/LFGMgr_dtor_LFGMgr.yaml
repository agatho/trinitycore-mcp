  signature: void LFGMgr::~LFGMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LFGMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~LFGMgr destructor is called when an instance of the LFGMgr class
    is being destroyed. This method ensures proper cleanup of all internal data structures,
    including active LFG (Looking for Group) queues, player group associations, and
    any allocated memory related to the LFG system. It is automatically invoked by
    the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The
    destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It
    is an essential part of the class's lifecycle management within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Automatic destruction of LFGMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LFGMgr* lfgMgr = new LFGMgr();\n    // ...\
      \ use lfgMgr ...\n    delete lfgMgr; // Destructor is automatically called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern, ensuring automatic cleanup when the object is no longer needed.
