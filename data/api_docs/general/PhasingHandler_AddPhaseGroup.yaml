  class: PhasingHandler
  method: AddPhaseGroup
  signature: void PhasingHandler::AddPhaseGroup(WorldObject * object, uint32 phaseGroupId,
    bool updateVisibility)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a phase group to the specified object's phasing context, optionally
    updating visibility.
  description: The AddPhaseGroup method integrates a specified phase group into the
    phasing system for a given WorldObject. This allows the object to participate
    in the defined phase, which can affect visibility, interaction, and other gameplay
    mechanics based on phase restrictions. The method supports an optional update
    of visibility for nearby players or objects, ensuring that the phasing changes
    are immediately reflected in the game world. Phase groups are typically used to
    manage dynamic environments, such as boss encounters, seasonal events, or area-based
    restrictions where certain content should only be visible or accessible during
    specific phases.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject (e.g., Player, Creature, GameObject) to
      which the phase group will be added. Must not be null.
  - name: phaseGroupId
    description: Unique identifier of the phase group to add. This ID must correspond
      to a valid phase group defined in the database or game configuration.
  - name: updateVisibility
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to immediately update visibility
      for nearby players. If true, the system will recalculate and broadcast visibility
      changes; if false, visibility is not updated until manually triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: PhasingHandler::AddPhaseGroup(player, 12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Phase Group Without Visibility Update
    code: PhasingHandler::AddPhaseGroup(creature, 67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with phase group definitions
    stored in the database. Ensure that the phase group ID exists and is properly
    configured to avoid unexpected behavior. Visibility updates can be performance-intensive
    if applied to many objects simultaneously.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'object' will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Always validate the phase group ID before calling this method to ensure
    it's valid in the current context.
