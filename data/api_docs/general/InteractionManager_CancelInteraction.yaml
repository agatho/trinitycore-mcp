  class: InteractionManager
  method: CancelInteraction
  signature: void InteractionManager::CancelInteraction(Player * bot, int targetGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels an ongoing interaction between a bot player and a target entity identified
    by GUID.
  description: The CancelInteraction method terminates any active interaction process
    involving a specified bot player and a target entity. This function is typically
    used in AI-driven bot behavior to halt ongoing actions such as trading, quest
    interactions, or object usage. It ensures that the bot's state is properly reset
    and any associated interaction flags are cleared. The method operates on a per-bot
    basis and requires a valid Player pointer and a target GUID to identify which
    interaction should be canceled.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose interaction
      needs to be canceled. Must not be null.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: Integer value representing the GUID of the target entity involved
      in the interaction. This identifies which specific interaction should be terminated.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      InteractionManager::CancelInteraction(myBot, targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Cancellation
    code: "if (bot->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_IN_COMBAT)) {\n    InteractionManager::CancelInteraction(bot,\
      \ targetGuid);\n    bot->CombatStop();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the interaction state is managed internally by the
    InteractionManager and that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid target. It
    does not perform any validation on the GUID or player object, so calling code
    should ensure these are valid before invoking this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent targetGuid may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. Always verify that the interaction exists
    before attempting cancellation.
