  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ConfirmQuestTurnIn
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ConfirmQuestTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Confirms the turn-in of a quest for a player bot, validating and completing
    the quest completion process.
  description: The ConfirmQuestTurnIn method is responsible for finalizing the quest
    turn-in process for a specified player bot. It validates that the quest can be
    turned in, checks if all requirements are met, and then proceeds to reward the
    player with experience, items, and other quest-related benefits. This method ensures
    proper state management within the TrinityCore framework when a player completes
    a quest. The method typically gets invoked during automated quest completion processes
    or when a bot is designed to automatically turn in quests. It performs necessary
    checks for quest validity, prerequisite fulfillment, and reward distribution before
    marking the quest as completed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is turning
      in the quest. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Must correspond to
      a valid quest in the game database and be accessible to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Confirmation
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized player bot

      uint32 questToTurnIn = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::ConfirmQuestTurnIn(myBot, questToTurnIn);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In with Validation
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif (bot && bot->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    QuestTurnIn::ConfirmQuestTurnIn(bot, questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all prerequisites for quest completion have already
    been validated. It is typically used in AI-driven bots or automated questing systems
    where the bot needs to programmatically confirm and complete quests without manual
    player interaction. The method may internally call other subsystems such as quest
    reward distribution, objective tracking, and state updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId corresponds to a valid quest that is
    actually completable by the given bot. Passing an invalid or unattainable quest
    ID may result in undefined behavior or silent failures. The method does not perform
    any safety checks on the player object itself beyond ensuring it's not null.
