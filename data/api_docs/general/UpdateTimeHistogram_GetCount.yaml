  class: UpdateTimeHistogram
  method: GetCount
  signature: uint32 UpdateTimeHistogram::GetCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of recorded update times in the histogram.
  description: The GetCount method retrieves the total count of recorded update times
    stored within the UpdateTimeHistogram instance. This histogram is typically used
    to track performance metrics for various game systems, such as AI update cycles
    or object processing times. The returned value represents how many individual
    update time measurements have been collected since the histogram was initialized
    or last reset. This count is essential for calculating averages, determining statistical
    distributions, and monitoring system performance over time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of recorded update times in
    the histogram. Returns 0 if no measurements have been recorded yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Histogram Size
    code: "UpdateTimeHistogram* histogram = new UpdateTimeHistogram();\n// ... record\
      \ some updates ...\nuint32 count = histogram->GetCount();\nif (count > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process the histogram data\n    printf(\"Recorded %u update times\\\
      n\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Count for Performance Analysis
    code: "UpdateTimeHistogram* aiUpdateHistogram = &sWorld->GetAIUpdateHistogram();\n\
      uint32 totalUpdates = aiUpdateHistogram->GetCount();\nif (totalUpdates >= 100)\n\
      {\n    // Calculate average update time\n    uint32 avgTime = aiUpdateHistogram->GetSum()\
      \ / totalUpdates;\n    printf(\"Average AI update time: %u ms\\n\", avgTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The histogram
    maintains an internal counter that is incremented each time a new update time
    is recorded via the AddMeasurement method. This count does not include any discarded
    or filtered measurements, so it represents the actual number of valid samples
    collected.
  warnings: Be aware that calling GetCount on a histogram that has never had measurements
    added will return 0, which might be confused with an error condition. Always verify
    that meaningful data exists before performing calculations based on this count.
