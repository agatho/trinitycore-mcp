documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a vehicle entity in the game
    world.
  description: The IsVehicle() method checks if the ObjectGuid instance corresponds
    to a vehicle object within the TrinityCore framework. This method examines the
    type information encoded within the GUID to determine if it belongs to the vehicle
    category. In World of Warcraft's context, vehicles are special game objects such
    as mounts, transport vehicles, or player-controlled vehicles that have specific
    behaviors and interactions. The check is performed using internal type flags or
    masks stored within the GUID structure, making this a fast O(1) operation. This
    method is commonly used in AI logic, interaction handling, and object validation
    systems where distinguishing between regular units and vehicles is necessary for
    proper gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a vehicle entity; otherwise returns
    false. A vehicle GUID typically has a specific type identifier set within its
    internal bitfield that this method evaluates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Check
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = player->GetTarget();\nif (guid.IsVehicle()) {\n    //\
      \ Handle vehicle-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Target is a vehicle.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Validation in AI
    code: "if (unit->GetGUID().IsVehicle()) {\n    // Skip normal attack logic for\
      \ vehicles\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with regular unit behavior"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid and assumes that
    vehicle type information is properly encoded in the GUID's type field. The implementation
    likely uses bit masking or enum comparisons against predefined vehicle type constants.
    Performance is optimal as it only requires reading a few bits from the GUID without
    any external lookups or database queries.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObjectGuid has been properly initialized before calling
    this method, as checking an invalid or uninitialized GUID may produce undefined
    behavior. This method should not be used for validation purposes where you need
    to distinguish between different types of vehicles; it only indicates if the object
    is a vehicle at all.
