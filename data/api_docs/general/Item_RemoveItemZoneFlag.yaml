  class: Item
  method: RemoveItemZoneFlag
  signature: void Item::RemoveItemZoneFlag(ItemZoneFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified zone flags from the item, affecting its behavior in different
    game zones.
  description: The RemoveItemZoneFlag method removes one or more zone-related flags
    from an Item object. These flags control how the item behaves when used or interacted
    with in different game zones, such as preventing use in certain areas or modifying
    item restrictions. The method takes a bitmask of ItemZoneFlags that specifies
    which flags to remove. This functionality is commonly used for managing item usability
    across different zones, such as removing zone-specific restrictions or enabling/disabling
    items based on player location or zone type.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask of ItemZoneFlags indicating which zone flags to remove
      from the item. Valid values are combinations of predefined zone flag constants
      that define specific behaviors like zone restrictions, area limitations, or
      zone-specific effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove zone restriction flag
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);

      item->RemoveItemZoneFlag(ITEM_ZONE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_RESTRICTIONS);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple zone flags
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);

      item->RemoveItemZoneFlag(ITEM_ZONE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_RESTRICTIONS | ITEM_ZONE_FLAG_NO_AREA_RESTRICTIONS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal flag state of the Item object. Changes
    take effect immediately and may affect item usability in real-time. The method
    does not perform any validation on the input flags, so it's important to ensure
    that only valid ItemZoneFlags are passed.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or malformed flag values can result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all flag values are from the predefined ItemZoneFlags
    enum to avoid unexpected issues. This method should not be called during critical
    item processing operations where flag consistency is required.
