  method: IsEmergencyScatterActive
  signature: bool FormationManager::IsEmergencyScatterActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether emergency scatter behavior is currently active for the formation
    manager.
  description: The IsEmergencyScatterActive method determines if the formation manager
    has triggered an emergency scatter state. This typically occurs when a unit or
    group within the formation encounters a critical situation that requires immediate
    repositioning away from the current formation. The method returns true if the
    emergency scatter is active, indicating that units should temporarily abandon
    their assigned formation positions and move to safe locations. This behavior is
    commonly used during combat scenarios where units need to avoid area-of-effect
    attacks or other dangerous conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if emergency scatter is currently active for the formation
    manager; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (formationManager.IsEmergencyScatterActive()) {\n    // Handle emergency\
      \ scatter state\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"system\", \"Emergency scatter is active, repositioning\
      \ units\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Formation Behavior
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (formationManager.IsEmergencyScatterActive())\
      \ {\n        // Skip normal formation logic\n        DoEmergencyMovement();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Execute normal formation behavior\n        FollowFormation();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with emergency scatter triggers
    that are activated by combat events or environmental hazards. The implementation
    likely involves checking internal flags or state variables within the FormationManager
    class to determine if a scatter operation is currently in progress.
  warnings: The method does not modify any internal state; it only reads the current
    emergency scatter status. Be aware that the emergency scatter state may change
    frequently during active combat scenarios, so repeated calls should be considered
    for performance impact.
