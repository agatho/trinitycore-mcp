  method: GetOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of offensive cooldowns currently active on the player.
  description: The GetOffensiveCooldowns method returns an integer representing the
    number of offensive abilities or spells that are currently on cooldown for the
    player. This is typically used within PvP combat AI logic to determine when a
    player can next use offensive actions. The method takes a pointer to a player
    object as input and evaluates its current cooldown state. It's commonly employed
    in AI decision-making processes where timing and ability availability are crucial
    factors.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which offensive cooldowns are being
      evaluated. Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: An integer representing the total count of offensive cooldowns active on
    the specified player. Returns 0 if no offensive cooldowns are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat AI
    code: "int cooldownCount = ai->GetOffensiveCooldowns(&player);\nif (cooldownCount\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Player can use offensive abilities\n    player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_OFFENSIVE_ABILITY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cooldown Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player.GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldowns = ai->GetOffensiveCooldowns(&player);\n\
      \nif (cooldowns < 3)\n{\n    // Player has fewer than 3 offensive cooldowns,\
      \ safe to use abilities\n    if (player.CanCastSpell(SPELL_STUN))\n        player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_STUN);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and should only be called
    on player objects that are actively engaged in PvP combat. The returned value
    includes all offensive abilities currently on cooldown, including spells, abilities,
    and talents with cooldowns. Performance is generally good as it's a simple lookup
    operation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid player pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure the player object is valid and in PvP combat before
    calling to avoid crashes or incorrect results.
