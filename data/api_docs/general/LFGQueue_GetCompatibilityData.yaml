  signature: LfgCompatibilityData * LFGQueue::GetCompatibilityData(const std::string
    & key)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves compatibility data for a specific LFG queue key
  description: The GetCompatibilityData method fetches the compatibility information
    associated with a given LFG (Looking for Group) queue key. This data typically
    contains information about player eligibility, group composition requirements,
    and other matching criteria used in the LFG system. The method is commonly used
    during group formation processes to determine if players are compatible with existing
    groups or queues. It returns a pointer to an LfgCompatibilityData object which
    holds all relevant compatibility parameters for the specified key.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A string identifier representing the LFG queue key for which compatibility
      data is requested. This key typically corresponds to a specific dungeon, raid,
      or group type within the LFG system.
  returns: A pointer to an LfgCompatibilityData object containing the compatibility
    information for the specified queue key. Returns nullptr if no compatibility data
    exists for the given key or if the key is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetCompatibilityData
    code: "LfgCompatibilityData* compatData = lfgQueue->GetCompatibilityData(\"dungeon_123\"\
      );\nif (compatData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process compatibility data\n    uint32\
      \ requiredLevel = compatData->GetRequiredLevel();\n    bool isEligible = compatData->IsPlayerEligible(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking compatibility before joining a group
    code: "std::string queueKey = \"raid_456\";\nLfgCompatibilityData* data = lfgQueue->GetCompatibilityData(queueKey);\n\
      if (data != nullptr && data->IsPlayerEligible(player))\n{\n    // Player can\
      \ join the group\n    lfgQueue->AddPlayerToQueue(player, queueKey);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Inform player they are not compatible\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, so
    performance should be considered when called frequently. The returned pointer
    is managed internally and should not be deleted by the caller. The LFG system
    uses this compatibility data to ensure proper group composition and prevent players
    from joining groups they are not qualified for.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no compatibility data exists for the
    given key, so always check for nullptr before using the result. Do not store or
    cache the returned pointer beyond the scope of its usage as it may become invalid
    during LFG system updates.
