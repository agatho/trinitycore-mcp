  class: DelayedUnitRelocation
  method: Visit
  signature: void DelayedUnitRelocation::Visit(int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes delayed unit relocation updates for the specified parameter.
  description: The Visit method in the DelayedUnitRelocation class handles the processing
    of delayed unit relocation events. This method is typically invoked during the
    game's update cycle to ensure that units are properly relocated according to scheduled
    or deferred movement operations. It processes the relocation data associated with
    the given parameter, which likely represents a unit or entity identifier. The
    method plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between client and
    server states for moving objects within the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that typically represents a unit identifier
      or relocation context index. This value is used to determine which specific
      delayed relocation operation should be processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Visit method
    code: 'DelayedUnitRelocation relocation;

      int unitId = 12345;

      relocation.Visit(unitId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal game state management system and should
    only be called from within the appropriate update loops or event handlers. The
    parameter value must correspond to a valid unit identifier or relocation context
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid parameters may lead to synchronization
    issues between client and server states. Ensure that all unit identifiers passed
    to this method are valid before calling to prevent potential crashes or game state
    corruption.
