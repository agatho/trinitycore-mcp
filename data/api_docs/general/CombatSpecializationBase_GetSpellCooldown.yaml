  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetSpellCooldown
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetSpellCooldown(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining cooldown time for a specified spell in milliseconds.
  description: The GetSpellCooldown method returns the current cooldown duration remaining
    for a given spell ID. This value represents how much time must pass before the
    spell can be cast again, measured in milliseconds. The method is typically used
    within combat specialization logic to manage spell usage timing and ensure proper
    cooldown handling during player or NPC actions. It's important to note that if
    the spell is not on cooldown, this method will return zero. This functionality
    is essential for implementing accurate combat mechanics and preventing players
    from spamming abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds.
    A return value of 0 indicates that the spell is currently not on cooldown and
    can be cast immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell is ready to use
    code: "uint32 cooldown = combatSpec->GetSpellCooldown(12345);\nif (cooldown ==\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Spell is ready to cast\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement cooldown-based UI feedback
    code: "uint32 cooldown = combatSpec->GetSpellCooldown(98765);\nif (cooldown >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    uint32 secondsRemaining = cooldown / 1000;\n    // Update UI to\
      \ show remaining cooldown time\n    SendCooldownUpdate(secondsRemaining);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Enable spell button or action\n    EnableSpellButton();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid combat specialization instances.
    The spell ID must correspond to an actual spell that has cooldown mechanics defined
    in the game database. Cooldowns are typically managed by the core system and may
    vary based on player class, talent specialization, and other factors such as buffs
    or debuffs.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a real spell with cooldown mechanics. Passing invalid spell IDs may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. This method does not account
    for global cooldowns - it only returns individual spell cooldowns.
