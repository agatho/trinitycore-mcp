  signature: void LFGMgr::SetOptions(uint32 options)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the LFG options for the player
  description: The SetOptions method configures the Looking For Group (LFG) settings
    for a player character. This method is used to enable or disable various LFG features
    such as auto-join, role checking, and group finding preferences. The options parameter
    controls which LFG behaviors are active for the player. This method typically
    interacts with the LFG system's internal state management to update player preferences
    and ensure proper synchronization with the game's LFG queue mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: options
    description: A bitmask value representing the LFG options to be set. Each bit
      corresponds to a specific LFG feature or behavior. Common bits include auto-join
      flags, role checking preferences, and group finding settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable all LFG options
    code: 'uint32 allOptions = LFG_OPTION_AUTO_JOIN | LFG_OPTION_ROLE_CHECK | LFG_OPTION_GROUP_FINDER;

      LFGMgr::SetOptions(allOptions);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable auto-join only
    code: 'uint32 currentOptions = GetPlayer()->GetLfgOptions();

      currentOptions &= ~LFG_OPTION_AUTO_JOIN;

      LFGMgr::SetOptions(currentOptions);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates that affect how the player
    appears in LFG queues. The options parameter should be constructed using predefined
    LFG option constants to ensure proper functionality. Changes made through this
    method may not take effect immediately and could require synchronization with
    the LFG queue system.
  warnings: Modifying LFG options without proper validation may cause unexpected behavior
    in group finding or role assignment. This method should only be called when the
    player is in a valid state for LFG operations, typically outside of combat or
    active group activities.
