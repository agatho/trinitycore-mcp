  class: PerformanceHotspot
  method: PerformanceHotspot
  signature: void PerformanceHotspot::PerformanceHotspot(HotspotCategory cat, const
    std::string & loc, double imp)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a performance hotspot with specified category, location, and
    importance.
  description: The PerformanceHotspot constructor initializes a new performance hotspot
    entry with the given category, location identifier, and importance value. This
    method is used to track and monitor performance bottlenecks within the game engine
    or subsystems. The category helps classify the type of hotspot (e.g., AI, rendering,
    network), the location provides context for where the hotspot occurs (typically
    a function or module name), and the importance determines how critical the hotspot
    is in terms of performance impact.
  parameters:
  - name: cat
    description: The category of the hotspot, used to classify the type of performance
      issue (e.g., AI, rendering, network).
  - name: loc
    description: A string identifier representing the location where the hotspot occurs,
      typically a function or module name.
  - name: imp
    description: A double value indicating the importance or severity of the hotspot,
      with higher values representing more critical issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Hotspot Initialization
    code: PerformanceHotspot hotspot(HotspotCategory::AI, "PlayerAI::Update", 0.8);
    language: cpp
  - title: Rendering Hotspot with High Importance
    code: PerformanceHotspot renderHotspot(HotspotCategory::RENDERING, "WorldObject::Render",
      0.95);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the performance monitoring system
    to track and log performance issues across different subsystems of TrinityCore.
    The importance value should be normalized between 0.0 (least important) and 1.0
    (most important).
  warnings: Incorrect category values may result in misclassification of performance
    issues. Ensure that the location string is properly formatted and unique to avoid
    confusion when analyzing performance data.
