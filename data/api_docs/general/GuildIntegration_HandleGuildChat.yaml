  brief: Processes and broadcasts guild chat messages to all guild members
  description: The HandleGuildChat method is responsible for processing incoming guild
    chat messages from players and broadcasting them to all online guild members.
    This method handles the core functionality of guild communication within the TrinityCore
    framework, ensuring that messages are properly formatted and delivered according
    to guild chat rules and permissions. It typically validates the sender's guild
    membership, checks message content for restrictions, and routes the message through
    the appropriate communication channels. The method operates as part of the broader
    guild integration system that manages all guild-related in-game communications.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object sending the guild chat message. This
      parameter represents the sender's character context and is used to verify guild
      membership and permissions.
  - name: message
    description: The GuildChatMessage object containing the actual chat content, message
      type, and metadata. This includes the message text, timestamp, and any special
      formatting or flags associated with the guild chat transmission.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic guild chat handling
    code: "void example() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\n \
      \   GuildChatMessage msg;\n    msg.text = \"Hello guild!\";\n    msg.type =\
      \ GUILD_CHAT_SAY;\n    guildIntegration.HandleGuildChat(&player, msg);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing guild officer chat
    code: "void processOfficerChat() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get officer player\
      \ reference\n    GuildChatMessage msg;\n    msg.text = \"Meeting at 8pm!\";\n\
      \    msg.type = GUILD_CHAT_OFFICER;\n    guildIntegration.HandleGuildChat(&player,\
      \ msg);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the game's message handling pipeline
    when a player sends a guild chat message. The implementation may perform additional
    validation checks such as ensuring the player is actually a member of a guild
    and has permission to send messages of the specified type. Performance considerations
    include avoiding excessive string operations during message broadcasting.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player pointer is valid and points to an active
    player object. Passing null or invalid player references can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. The message parameter should be properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid sending malformed chat messages.
