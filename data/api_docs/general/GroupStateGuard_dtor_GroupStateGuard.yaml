documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupStateGuard instance and restores the previous group state.
  description: The ~GroupStateGuard destructor is responsible for cleaning up the
    guard object and ensuring that the group's state is properly restored to its original
    condition before the guard was applied. This mechanism is typically used in scenarios
    where temporary modifications to a group's state need to be made, such as during
    player joining or leaving operations, or when applying temporary group buffs.
    The destructor ensures that any changes made while the guard was active are reverted,
    maintaining consistency in the group's internal state. It is important to note
    that this method should only be called on properly initialized GroupStateGuard
    objects.

  - title: Basic Usage of GroupStateGuard Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    Group* group = ...; // Get a valid group\n \
      \   {\n        GroupStateGuard guard(group);\n        // Perform operations\
      \ that modify group state\n        // ...\n    } // Destructor automatically\
      \ called here, restoring group state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GroupStateGuard is designed to be a stack-based RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) guard. Its destructor ensures automatic cleanup and restoration
    of the group's state upon leaving the scope where it was created. This pattern
    prevents accidental state corruption during group operations.
