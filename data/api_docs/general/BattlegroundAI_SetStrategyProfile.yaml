api:
  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: SetStrategyProfile
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::SetStrategyProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const BGStrategyProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the strategy profile for a specific player within the battleground AI
    system.
  description: The SetStrategyProfile method assigns a predefined BGStrategyProfile
    to a player identified by their GUID within the BattlegroundAI framework. This
    allows for dynamic adjustment of AI behaviors and tactics during battlegrounds,
    enabling different strategic approaches based on player roles or team composition.
    The method typically updates internal AI state tracking for the specified player,
    ensuring that subsequent AI decisions align with the provided strategy profile.
    This functionality is crucial for implementing adaptive AI systems in competitive
    battleground environments where tactical flexibility can impact gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose strategy profile
      will be set. Must correspond to a valid player in the current battleground context.
  - name: profile
    description: The BGStrategyProfile object containing the strategic behaviors and
      decision-making parameters to assign to the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Defensive Strategy Profile
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = ...; // Get battleground AI instance

      uint32 playerGUID = 123456;

      BGStrategyProfile defensiveProfile;

      // Configure defensive profile settings

      bgAI->SetStrategyProfile(playerGUID, defensiveProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Strategy Based on Player Role
    code: "BattlegroundAI* bgAI = ...;\nuint32 playerGUID = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      BGStrategyProfile roleBasedProfile;\nif (player->GetRole() == PLAYER_ROLE_TANK)\n\
      {\n    roleBasedProfile.SetTacticalPreference(TACTIC_DEFENSIVE);\n}\nelse if\
      \ (player->GetRole() == PLAYER_ROLE_DAMAGE)\n{\n    roleBasedProfile.SetTacticalPreference(TACTIC_OFFENSIVE);\n\
      }\nbgAI->SetStrategyProfile(playerGUID, roleBasedProfile);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal AI state tracking for the specified player.
    It should be called during appropriate game phases where strategy adjustments
    are valid, such as before or during battleground start sequences. The BGStrategyProfile
    object must be properly initialized with valid tactical settings to ensure meaningful
    behavior changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or AI state corruption. Ensure that the player is actually participating
    in the current battleground before calling this method. Avoid frequent calls during
    active gameplay as it might impact performance.
