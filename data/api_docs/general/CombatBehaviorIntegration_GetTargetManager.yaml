  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetTargetManager
  signature: TargetManager * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetTargetManager()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target manager instance associated with this combat behavior
    integration.
  description: The GetTargetManager method provides access to the TargetManager object
    that handles target selection and management for combat behaviors within the TrinityCore
    AI system. This method is typically used by AI scripts and combat logic to determine
    which unit should be targeted during combat operations. The returned pointer is
    valid for the lifetime of the CombatBehaviorIntegration instance and should not
    be deleted by the caller. This method does not perform any target validation or
    selection itself, but rather returns a reference to an existing target management
    system that may be shared among multiple behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the TargetManager instance used by this combat behavior integration,
    or nullptr if no target manager has been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* behavior = ...;\nTargetManager* targetMgr =\
      \ behavior->GetTargetManager();\nif (targetMgr)\n{\n    Unit* target = targetMgr->GetTarget();\n\
      \    // Use the target for combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class MyCombatBehavior : public CombatBehaviorIntegration\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    void Update()\n    {\n        TargetManager* tm = GetTargetManager();\n\
      \        if (!tm || !tm->IsValidTarget())\n        {\n            // Handle\
      \ case where no valid target exists\n            return;\n        }\n      \
      \  \n        Unit* target = tm->GetTarget();\n        // Perform combat actions\
      \ against target\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TargetManager pointer is managed by the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance and should not be deleted. This method may return nullptr if the integration
    has not been properly initialized with a target manager. The target manager's
    internal state may change during combat, so callers should verify target validity
    before using the returned pointer.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or destroyed CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance may result in a null pointer dereference. Always check for nullptr return
    values before using the TargetManager pointer. Do not store references to the
    returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the owning CombatBehaviorIntegration object.
