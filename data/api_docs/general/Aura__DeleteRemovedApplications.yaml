documentation:
  brief: Removes and cleans up aura applications that have been marked for deletion
    from the aura.
  description: The _DeleteRemovedApplications method is an internal utility function
    within the Aura class responsible for cleaning up aura applications that have
    been flagged for removal. This method iterates through the list of removed aura
    applications and performs necessary cleanup operations, such as removing references,
    notifying affected units, and freeing memory associated with those applications.
    It ensures that aura applications marked for deletion are properly disposed of
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain the integrity of the aura system. The method
    is typically called during the aura's update cycle or when the aura is being destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Internal cleanup during aura update
    code: "void Aura::UpdateAura()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    _DeleteRemovedApplications();\n\
      \    // ... continue with remaining updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. The method operates on internal data structures and assumes proper locking
    mechanisms are in place. It's typically invoked as part of the aura's lifecycle
    management during updates or destruction.
  warnings: Calling this method directly from outside the Aura class may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory corruption, as it assumes specific internal state and locking
    conditions. This method should only be called from within the Aura class or its
    derived classes.
