documentation:
  brief: Determines whether interaction is allowed while in combat.
  description: This method checks if a unit can engage in interactions such as talking
    to NPCs or using game objects while currently in combat. It returns true if interaction
    is permitted and false if it's prohibited due to combat state. The method is commonly
    used in conjunction with other combat-related functions to manage player behavior
    during combat situations, particularly when dealing with quest interactions or
    NPC dialogue.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit can interact while in combat, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit's current combat state allows for interaction
    with NPCs or game objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsInteractionAllowedInCombat())\n{\n    // Allow interaction\n\
      \    player->TalkToNPC();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Prevent interaction\n    player->SendChatMessage(\"\
      Cannot interact while in combat\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    like IsInCombat() and IsHostileTo(). It's important to note that this method may
    return false even if the unit is not currently in combat, as it depends on various
    game state conditions.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking for combat state, as
    it may return false even when the unit is not actively engaged in combat. Be sure
    to verify the actual combat status before relying on this method for interaction
    decisions.
