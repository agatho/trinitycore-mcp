  signature: void RandomMovementFactory::RandomMovementFactory()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the RandomMovementFactory class.
  description: The RandomMovementFactory constructor initializes the factory object
    responsible for generating random movement patterns for AI-controlled creatures
    in World of Warcraft. This factory is typically used by the TrinityCore AI system
    to create movement behaviors that simulate natural creature movement, including
    random walks, pathfinding, and avoidance behaviors. The constructor sets up internal
    state variables and initializes any required data structures needed for generating
    random movement sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a RandomMovementFactory instance
    code: 'RandomMovementFactory factory;

      // The factory is now ready to generate random movement patterns

      // for AI-controlled creatures in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    It primarily sets up internal state needed for subsequent movement generation
    operations. The actual movement pattern generation occurs through other methods
    of the class, not during construction.
