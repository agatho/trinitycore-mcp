  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: DeactivateStrategy
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::DeactivateStrategy(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a combat strategy based on provided flags.
  description: The DeactivateStrategy method is used to disable or suspend a specific
    combat behavior strategy within the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. This method
    accepts a set of flags that define which aspects of the combat strategy should
    be deactivated. The flags are typically used to control different components or
    phases of the AI's combat behavior, such as spell casting, movement patterns,
    or target selection. When called, this method modifies the internal state of the
    combat behavior integration to reflect the deactivation of the specified strategy
    components. This is commonly used during transitions between different combat
    states or when certain conditions are met that require temporarily disabling specific
    AI behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask value specifying which components of the combat strategy
      should be deactivated. Each bit in the flag represents a different aspect of
      the combat behavior (e.g., spell casting, movement, targeting). Valid values
      are defined by the combat strategy system's flag constants.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deactivate all combat strategies
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration* integration = ...;

      integration->DeactivateStrategy(0xFFFFFFFF); // Deactivate all strategies

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate only spell casting strategy
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration* integration = ...;

      const uint32 SPELL_CASTING_FLAG = 0x00000001;

      integration->DeactivateStrategy(SPELL_CASTING_FLAG); // Only disable spell casting

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object and should be called carefully to avoid unintended side effects in combat
    behavior. The flags parameter is typically a bitmask where each bit corresponds
    to a specific strategy component. It's important to understand which bits correspond
    to which behaviors as defined by the game's combat system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper understanding of the flag values may
    result in unexpected behavior or complete disabling of combat AI functionality.
    Ensure that any deactivation is properly balanced with reactivation calls to maintain
    proper AI behavior during combat.
