  method: GetSpellInfo
  signature: const SpellInfo * Spell::GetSpellInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information about the
    spell.
  description: The GetSpellInfo method retrieves the SpellInfo structure associated
    with the current spell instance. This structure contains comprehensive data about
    the spell including its ID, name, description, effects, and various game mechanics
    parameters. The method is commonly used in spell handling code to access spell
    properties for processing or validation purposes. It's typically called during
    spell execution or when evaluating spell effects to ensure proper behavior and
    to access spell-specific data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellInfo structure which contains detailed information
    about the spell, including its ID, name, description, effects, and other game
    mechanics parameters. The returned pointer may be null if the spell has not been
    properly initialized or if the spell information is not available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Spell* spell = new Spell();\nconst SpellInfo* info = spell->GetSpellInfo();\n\
      if (info)\n{\n    // Use info->Id to access spell ID\n    // Use info->Name\
      \ to access spell name\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads simultaneously.
    The returned SpellInfo pointer should not be modified as it represents immutable
    data. Performance considerations are minimal as the method simply returns a cached
    reference to the spell information structure.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in spell processing code,
    as accessing invalid or null SpellInfo structures can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper initialization of spell objects before calling this method.
