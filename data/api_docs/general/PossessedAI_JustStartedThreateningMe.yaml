  brief: Handles the event when a possessed creature begins threatening the player
  description: The JustStartedThreateningMe method is invoked when a possessed AI-controlled
    creature starts targeting and threatening the player character. This method is
    typically called during the AI's threat update cycle to notify the creature's
    behavior logic that it has begun actively engaging with the player. It allows
    the possessed creature to react appropriately to the start of combat or aggressive
    behavior towards the player, potentially triggering animations, sound effects,
    or other AI behaviors specific to threatening actions.

  - title: Basic Implementation Override
    code: "void PossessedAI::JustStartedThreateningMe(int* param0)\n{\n    // Play\
      \ threat sound effect\n    Unit->PlayDirectSound(12345);\n    \n    // Start\
      \ aggressive animation\n    Unit->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      \    \n    // Log the event\n    sLog->outString(\"Possessed creature started\
      \ threatening player\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system's threat management and should be overridden
    in custom possessed AI implementations. The parameter 'param0' is likely a placeholder
    or unused value, as the signature indicates it accepts an int pointer but no actual
    parameter is passed in standard usage.
