documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another QuestHubDatabase instance to this instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source QuestHubDatabase object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer the internal state, such as database connections
    or cached data, without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a
    valid but unspecified state after the move. In the context of TrinityCore's quest
    system, this method may be used to reassign database handles or connection pools
    between QuestHubDatabase instances during runtime operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current QuestHubDatabase instance, allowing for chaining
    of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase db1;

      QuestHubDatabase db2 = std::move(db1); // Move-assigns db1 to db2

      // db1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase db1, db2, db3;

      // ... initialize databases ...

      db3 = std::move(db2) = std::move(db1); // Chained move assignments

      // db1 and db2 are left in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics standard. It should only be
    called when the source object will no longer be used, as it leaves the source
    in a valid but undefined state. The implementation likely involves transferring
    pointers or handles rather than copying data, making it more efficient than copy
    assignment.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after calling this operator unless you
    explicitly reset or reinitialize it. Using an object after move assignment can
    lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
