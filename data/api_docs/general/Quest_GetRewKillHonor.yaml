documentation:
  brief: Returns the honor points reward for completing a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the honor point value associated with a quest's
    kill reward. It is used to determine how many honor points a player will receive
    upon completing a quest that involves killing creatures or NPCs. The method is
    typically called during quest completion processing and helps in calculating the
    total honor gained from quest rewards. This value can be zero if the quest does
    not provide honor rewards, or it may contain a positive integer representing the
    honor points earned.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the honor points reward for completing
    the quest. If the quest does not provide honor rewards, this value will be zero.
    Otherwise, it returns the number of honor points the player will receive upon
    completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 honorReward = quest->GetRewKillHonor();\nif (honorReward > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player gets honor points\n    Player->AddHonorPoints(honorReward);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system and should be used during quest completion
    processing. The value returned may vary depending on the specific quest configuration
    and player's level relative to the quest requirements.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the honor points associated with
    kill rewards; other quest rewards like experience or gold may not be included
    in this value. Also, if the quest does not have a kill reward, this method will
    return zero.
