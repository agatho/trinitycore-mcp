  class: BattlegroundScore
  method: GetHealingDone
  signature: int BattlegroundScore::GetHealingDone() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total healing done by a player in a battleground.
  description: The GetHealingDone method retrieves the accumulated amount of healing
    performed by a specific player during a battleground match. This value is typically
    tracked as part of the player's score statistics and contributes to overall performance
    evaluation in battlegrounds such as Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, or Eye of the
    Storm. The returned integer represents the total healing done in terms of health
    points restored to allies. This method is commonly used for scoring purposes and
    reporting during battleground end-of-match statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total amount of healing done by the player
    during the battleground match. A value of zero indicates no healing was performed
    or the score has not been updated yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Healing Done
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      int healingDone = score->GetHealingDone();

      printf("Player healed for %d health points\n", healingDone);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Healing Done in Score Calculation
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      int healing = score->GetHealingDone();

      int damage = score->GetDamageDone();

      int scoreValue = healing + (damage / 2); // Example scoring formula'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlegroundScore class which tracks various performance
    metrics for players during battlegrounds. The healing value may be updated in
    real-time as the player heals others, and it's typically reset when a new battleground
    match begins. This method does not account for overhealing or self-healing unless
    explicitly tracked by the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlegroundScore object is valid before calling this
    method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also
    note that healing done may be zero if the player did not participate in healing
    during the match or if the score has not yet been updated.
