api:
  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetPowerTypeForResource
  signature: int ResourceManager::GetPowerTypeForResource(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the power type associated with a specified resource type.
  description: The GetPowerTypeForResource method maps a given ResourceType to its
    corresponding PowerType. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to determine what type of power (such as mana, rage, energy) should
    be consumed or modified when interacting with specific resources like items, spells,
    or abilities. The mapping between resource types and power types is defined within
    the ResourceManager class and typically reflects game mechanics such as spell
    cost calculations or resource consumption rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the PowerType associated with the specified
    ResourceType. Possible values correspond to standard WoW power types like POWER_MANA
    (0), POWER_RAGE (1), POWER_ENERGY (2), etc., depending on how the ResourceManager
    is configured for that particular resource.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ResourceType resource = ResourceType::RUNE;

      int powerType = resourceManager->GetPowerTypeForResource(resource);

      // Returns the corresponding power type for runes, e.g., POWER_RUNES (3)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ResourceManager has been properly initialized
    with valid mappings between resource types and power types. It is typically used
    internally by systems handling spell casting, item usage, or ability activation
    where resource consumption needs to be tracked against appropriate power pools.
