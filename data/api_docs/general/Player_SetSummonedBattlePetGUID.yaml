  class: Player
  method: SetSummonedBattlePetGUID
  signature: void Player::SetSummonedBattlePetGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the summoned battle pet for the player.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the player's summoned
    battle pet, allowing the game to track and manage the pet's state within the World
    of Warcraft environment. The GUID typically represents the specific battle pet
    instance that has been summoned by the player, and this method is used in conjunction
    with other battle pet management functions to ensure proper tracking of summoned
    pets during gameplay. This function likely affects how the pet is handled internally
    by the game engine, particularly when dealing with battle pet mechanics and player
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the summoned battle pet. This value
      represents a specific battle pet instance that has been summoned by the player,
      typically used to track the pet's state within the game engine.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetSummonedBattlePetGUID(12345);

      // This sets the GUID of the summoned battle pet to 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal battle pet tracking data structures
    within the player object, and should be used carefully as it may affect how the
    game handles battle pet summoning mechanics. Performance considerations are minimal
    but may involve memory management when dealing with large numbers of players.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect battle pet tracking
    or state issues, particularly if the GUID value is not valid or properly formatted.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid battle pet
    instance before calling this method.
