documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a trainer.
  description: This method checks if the Unit object represents a trainer, which is
    typically used to identify NPCs that offer training services. It returns true
    if the unit is a trainer and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game
    logic to determine if an NPC can provide training services for player characters.
    This functionality is essential for implementing trainer-related behaviors in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a trainer, false otherwise. The method specifically
    checks for the presence of trainer flags or related data that indicates the unit
    can provide training services.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsTrainer()) {\n    // Handle trainer logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags and data structures within the TrinityCore
    framework. It may involve checking specific NPC flags or database entries that
    indicate trainer status. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple
    boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a unit can train a player's
    skills, as it only checks if the unit is a trainer. The actual training logic
    requires additional checks and may involve different methods or flags.
