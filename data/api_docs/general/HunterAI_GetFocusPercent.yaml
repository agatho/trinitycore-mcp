  method: GetFocusPercent
  signature: float HunterAI::GetFocusPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current focus percentage of the hunter's pet.
  description: The GetFocusPercent method retrieves the focus percentage value for
    the hunter's pet, which represents how much focus the pet currently has relative
    to its maximum focus. This value is typically used in AI decision-making logic
    to determine when the pet should use focus-based abilities or when it needs to
    regenerate focus. The returned value is a floating-point number between 0.0 and
    100.0, where 0.0 indicates no focus and 100.0 indicates full focus. This method
    is commonly called by HunterAI implementations to make tactical decisions about
    pet behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current focus percentage of the hunter's
    pet, ranging from 0.0 (no focus) to 100.0 (full focus).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (hunterAI->GetFocusPercent() >= 75.0f)\n{\n    // Pet has sufficient\
      \ focus to use a high-cost ability\n    pet->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HIGH_COST_ABILITY,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using focus percentage for focus management
    code: "float focusPercent = hunterAI->GetFocusPercent();\nif (focusPercent < 20.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Pet is low on focus, consider using focus regeneration abilities\n\
      \    if (pet->HasSpell(SPELL_FOCUS_REGEN))\n    {\n        pet->CastSpell(pet,\
      \ SPELL_FOCUS_REGEN, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the hunter's pet having a valid focus system. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific pet type and its focus mechanics. The value
    returned is typically updated during each AI update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter's pet exists and has a valid focus system before
    calling this method, as calling it on an invalid pet may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect values.
