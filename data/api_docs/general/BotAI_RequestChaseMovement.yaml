    int targetGuid, const std::string & reason, const std::string & sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Requests the bot to chase a target with specified priority and reason.
  description: The RequestChaseMovement method initiates a chase movement behavior
    for a player bot, instructing it to follow a specific target identified by its
    GUID. The method accepts a priority level to determine how urgently the bot should
    pursue the target, along with optional reason and source system identifiers for
    logging or debugging purposes. This functionality is typically used in AI-driven
    bot systems within TrinityCore to control bot behavior during combat or quest-related
    activities where following a target is required. The method returns true if the
    chase request was successfully queued or initiated, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level of the chase movement request. Defines how urgently
      the bot should pursue the target, typically from low to high priority levels.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player or creature that
      the bot should chase.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive reason for initiating the chase, useful for logging
      and debugging purposes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: The system or module that initiated this chase request, used for
      tracking and categorization.
  returns: Returns true if the chase movement request was successfully processed and
    queued; otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters
    or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Request
    code: "if (botAI->RequestChaseMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH, 12345,\
      \ \"Quest objective\", \"QuestSystem\")) {\n    // Chasing started successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Chase with Priority Handling
    code: "PlayerBotMovementPriority priority = PlayerBotMovementPriority::MEDIUM;\n\
      int targetGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nstd::string reason = \"Combat\
      \ engagement\";\nstd::string source = \"CombatAI\";\n\nif (botAI->RequestChaseMovement(priority,\
      \ targetGuid, reason, source)) {\n    // Log successful chase initiation\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Bot initiated chase with priority %u\", static_cast<uint32>(priority));\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initiate\
      \ chase movement for bot\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    movement and AI subsystems. It assumes that the target exists in the world and
    is accessible to the bot. The priority levels may affect how quickly the bot responds
    to the request, and should be used appropriately depending on the game context.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID is valid and that the target is within the
    bot's visibility range; otherwise, the movement request may fail silently or result
    in no action. Avoid calling this method excessively without checking for existing
    chase requests to prevent performance degradation.
