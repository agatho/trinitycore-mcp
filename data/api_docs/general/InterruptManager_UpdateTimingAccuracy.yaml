  class: InterruptManager
  method: UpdateTimingAccuracy
  signature: void InterruptManager::UpdateTimingAccuracy(const InterruptResult & result)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timing accuracy of an interrupt result based on game mechanics
    and player actions.
  description: The UpdateTimingAccuracy method adjusts the precision of interrupt
    results within the InterruptManager class. This method is typically invoked when
    processing spell or ability interruptions to ensure that timing calculations reflect
    accurate game state conditions. It evaluates the provided interrupt result and
    modifies its timing parameters according to internal logic, potentially adjusting
    for latency, server tick rates, or other temporal factors. The method plays a
    crucial role in maintaining synchronization between client and server timing during
    combat interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The InterruptResult object containing the interrupt data that needs
      timing accuracy adjustment. This parameter represents the current state of an
      interrupt event including its timing, success status, and related metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptResult result;

      // ... populate result with data ...

      interruptManager.UpdateTimingAccuracy(result);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Timing Adjustment
    code: "InterruptResult result;\nresult.SetTiming(1234);\nresult.SetSuccess(true);\n\
      \n// Update timing accuracy based on game state\ninterruptManager.UpdateTimingAccuracy(result);\n\
      \nif (result.GetAdjustedTiming() > 0) {\n    // Process adjusted timing data\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"Updated interrupt timing: {}\", result.GetAdjustedTiming());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the combat system when handling
    spell interrupts. It may perform calculations involving server tick intervals,
    client-server synchronization delays, or other temporal factors specific to TrinityCore's
    architecture. The implementation should be thread-safe as it may be invoked from
    different game threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the InterruptResult object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling. Improperly constructed interrupt results may lead
    to incorrect timing adjustments or undefined behavior. This method modifies the
    input result in-place, so consider making a copy if the original data needs preservation.
