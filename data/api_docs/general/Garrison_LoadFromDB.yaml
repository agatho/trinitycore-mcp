api:
  class: Garrison
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: bool Garrison::LoadFromDB(int garrison, int blueprints, int buildings,
    int followers, int abilities)
documentation:
  brief: Loads garrison data from the database including blueprints, buildings, followers,
    and abilities.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes and loads all relevant garrison data
    for a player from the database. It retrieves information about the garrison's
    blueprints, buildings, followers, and abilities, populating internal data structures
    with this information. This method is typically called during player login or
    when a garrison needs to be reinitialized in memory. The method ensures that all
    garrison-related data is synchronized with the persistent database state. It handles
    loading of multiple related entities in a single operation for efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: garrison
    description: Identifier for the garrison type or instance to load data for
  - name: blueprints
    description: Flag indicating whether to load blueprint data for the garrison
  - name: buildings
    description: Flag indicating whether to load building data for the garrison
  - name: followers
    description: Flag indicating whether to load follower data for the garrison
  - name: abilities
    description: Flag indicating whether to load ability data for the garrison
  returns: Returns true if all data was successfully loaded from the database, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if database access fails or if required
    data cannot be found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Garrison garrison;\nbool success = garrison.LoadFromDB(1, 1, 1, 1, 1);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Garrison data loaded successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Selective Loading
    code: "Garrison garrison;\n// Load only buildings and followers\nbool success\
      \ = garrison.LoadFromDB(1, 0, 1, 1, 0);\nif (success) {\n    // Only building\
      \ and follower data loaded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations that may impact performance if called
    frequently. It's recommended to call this method only when necessary, such as
    during player login or garrison initialization. The method assumes proper database
    connection is already established and that the player has a valid garrison.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database connectivity will result in
    failed loads. Ensure that all required database tables for garrison data exist
    before calling this method. This method may overwrite existing internal garrison
    data, so ensure it's called at appropriate times during the game flow.
