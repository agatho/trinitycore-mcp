  method: TurnInCompletedQuests
  signature: void QuestManager::TurnInCompletedQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Completes all available quests for the player that are eligible for turn-in.
  description: The TurnInCompletedQuests method processes and completes all quests
    in a player's quest log that have been marked as completed but not yet turned
    in. This method typically iterates through the player's active quests, identifies
    those that meet the completion criteria (such as having all required kills or
    items), and triggers the quest completion logic. It handles the necessary updates
    to the player's quest state, rewards distribution, and quest log cleanup. The
    method is commonly invoked during quest submission events or when a player attempts
    to turn in quests at a quest giver NPC.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      QuestManager& qm = player->GetQuestManager();

      qm.TurnInCompletedQuests();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state for
    quest turn-in, typically after completing quest objectives. It may internally
    call other methods such as Quest::Complete(), Player::RewardQuest(), or Quest::UpdateQuestObjective().
    The method does not return any status information, so callers should ensure preconditions
    are met before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate game contexts (e.g., during
    quest initialization or in an invalid player state) may lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. It is recommended to verify that the player has completed quests and
    that the quest turn-in process is valid before calling this method.
