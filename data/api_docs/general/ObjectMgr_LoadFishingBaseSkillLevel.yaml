documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the base fishing skill levels for all game zones from
    the database.
  description: The LoadFishingBaseSkillLevel method is responsible for loading the
    base fishing skill requirements for different zones in the game world. This method
    retrieves data from the database table containing fishing zone information and
    sets up internal structures that determine at what skill level players can fish
    in specific areas. It ensures that each zone has a valid minimum skill requirement,
    which affects whether players can successfully catch fish in those locations.
    The method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that fishing mechanics are properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadFishingBaseSkillLevel();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading fishing data. It modifies internal game state and does not support concurrent
    access. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the relevant fishing zone tables contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent skill level data. Ensure that the database tables
    contain valid entries for all zones, otherwise default values may be used which
    could break gameplay balance.
