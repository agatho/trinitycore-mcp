  signature: void VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorAnalysis(uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the vendor analysis data for a specified vendor GUID.
  description: The UpdateVendorAnalysis method performs an internal update of vendor-related
    data for a given vendor identified by its GUID. This typically involves recalculating
    or refreshing information such as item availability, pricing, stock levels, or
    other dynamic vendor properties. The method is likely invoked during vendor interactions,
    inventory refreshes, or when vendor data needs to be synchronized with the game
    state. It operates on the vendor's current state and may trigger additional internal
    logic related to vendor behavior or player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor whose analysis data is
      to be updated. This value must correspond to a valid NPC in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update vendor analysis for a specific vendor
    code: 'VendorInteraction interaction;

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      interaction.UpdateVendorAnalysis(vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal data synchronization and may involve
    database or cache updates. It should be called only when necessary to avoid unnecessary
    performance overhead.
