  class: Item
  method: IsSoulBound
  signature: bool Item::IsSoulBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item is bound to a player's soul, preventing it from
    being traded or dropped.
  description: The IsSoulBound method checks if an item has been marked as soul-bound,
    meaning it cannot be traded, dropped, or sold to other players. This binding type
    typically applies to items that are unique or have special properties tied to
    the player who obtained them. The method returns true when the item is soul-bound
    and false otherwise, indicating whether the item can be freely moved or transferred.
    In World of Warcraft, this functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance
    and preventing exploitation of item mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is soul-bound, indicating it cannot be traded
    or dropped; returns false otherwise, meaning the item can be freely moved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (item->IsSoulBound()) {\n    // Do something\n}\nelse {\n    // Do something\
      \ else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item binding checks
    and may be part of a larger system for determining item usability. It's important
    to note that soul-bound items often have restrictions on their use or transfer,
    particularly in PvP scenarios.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    binding types, as there may be conflicts between different binding states (e.g.,
    bind on pickup vs bind on equip).
