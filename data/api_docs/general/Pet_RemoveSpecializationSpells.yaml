  class: Pet
  method: RemoveSpecializationSpells
  signature: void Pet::RemoveSpecializationSpells(bool clearActionBar)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specialization spells from the pet's spell book and optionally clears
    its action bar.
  description: The RemoveSpecializationSpells method removes all specialization-specific
    spells from a pet's spell list. This typically occurs when a pet's specialization
    changes or is removed, ensuring that outdated or invalid spells are no longer
    available to the pet. The method can also optionally clear the pet's action bar
    if the clearActionBar parameter is set to true. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining proper spell availability and preventing conflicts between different
    pet specializations.
  parameters:
  - name: clearActionBar
    description: When true, clears the pet's action bar in addition to removing specialization
      spells. When false, only removes the spells without affecting the action bar.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove specialization spells and clear action bar
    code: pet->RemoveSpecializationSpells(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove specialization spells without clearing action bar
    code: pet->RemoveSpecializationSpells(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a pet's
    specialization changes. Developers should be aware that removing spells may affect
    the pet's combat effectiveness until new spells are properly applied.
  warnings: Calling this method directly on a pet without proper context may result
    in unexpected behavior or loss of spell functionality. Ensure that any spell removal
    is coordinated with appropriate updates to the pet's spell list and action bar
    state.
