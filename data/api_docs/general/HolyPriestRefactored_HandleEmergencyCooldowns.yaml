documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency cooldown management for Holy Priest abilities based on
    group context
  description: The HandleEmergencyCooldowns method manages critical cooldown resets
    or adjustments for Holy Priest abilities during emergency situations or specific
    group scenarios. This method typically activates when certain conditions are met,
    such as incoming damage spikes or strategic gameplay events that require immediate
    ability usage. It evaluates the current state of the priest's cooldowns and applies
    necessary adjustments to maintain optimal spell usage efficiency within the group
    context. The method may trigger cooldown reductions, forced ability resets, or
    emergency healing spell prioritization based on group composition and threat levels.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Represents the group identifier or context that determines which
      cooldown management rules to apply. Valid values are typically group IDs from
      0-4, where each ID corresponds to a specific emergency scenario or group configuration.
  returns: Returns true if the emergency cooldown handling was successfully processed
    and applied, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no emergency
    conditions were met, cooldown management was already in progress, or an error
    occurred during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Cooldown Handling
    code: "if (priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(2)) {\n    // Emergency cooldowns\
      \ applied successfully\n    // Continue with normal execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group-Specific Emergency Handling
    code: "switch (current_group_id) {\n    case 0:\n        priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(0);\n\
      \        break;\n    case 1:\n        priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(1);\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(2);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during high-priority combat situations where
    rapid response to group needs is required. The implementation may involve checking
    current cooldown timers, evaluating group health status, and applying emergency
    spell adjustments. Performance considerations include minimizing state checks
    and ensuring quick decision-making during critical moments.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper group context validation may
    lead to incorrect cooldown management or unexpected behavior. Always ensure that
    the group parameter corresponds to valid emergency scenarios before calling this
    method.
