  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetQueuedInteractions
  signature: uint32 InteractionManager::GetQueuedInteractions() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of queued interactions in the interaction manager.
  description: The GetQueuedInteractions method retrieves the count of pending interactions
    that are currently queued for processing within the InteractionManager. This value
    represents how many interaction events (such as player actions, NPC responses,
    or quest updates) are waiting to be handled by the system. The method is typically
    used for debugging, performance monitoring, or determining the workload of the
    interaction queue. It does not modify any state and is safe to call from any thread
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of interactions currently
    queued for processing in the InteractionManager. Returns zero if no interactions
    are queued.
  examples:
  - title: Check interaction queue size
    code: "uint32 queued = interactionManager.GetQueuedInteractions();\nif (queued\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"High interaction queue\
      \ detected: %u\", queued);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor queue for performance issues
    code: "void CheckInteractionQueue()\n{\n    uint32 count = sObjectMgr->GetInteractionManager()->GetQueuedInteractions();\n\
      \    if (count > 500)\n    {\n        sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"\
      Interaction queue overload: %u interactions queued\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter. It is
    not a heavy operation and can be safely called from performance-critical sections
    of code. The returned value may change immediately after the call due to concurrent
    interaction processing.
