  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: SetSwitchDelay
  signature: void TargetAssistAction::SetSwitchDelay(uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the delay time in milliseconds for target switching behavior in the
    AI system.
  description: The SetSwitchDelay method configures the cooldown period between target
    switches for an AI-controlled unit. This delay prevents rapid, continuous target
    changes that could disrupt gameplay or cause performance issues. The value is
    typically used in conjunction with target assist behaviors where the AI needs
    to evaluate and potentially switch targets based on threat or other conditions.
    Setting this value affects how frequently the AI will consider switching targets
    during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: delayMs
    description: The delay time in milliseconds between target switches. Valid values
      are typically positive integers representing time intervals. A value of 0 may
      disable the delay, while larger values increase the cooldown period.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TargetAssistAction* action = new TargetAssistAction();

      action->SetSwitchDelay(1000); // Set 1 second delay between target switches'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Delay
    code: 'TargetAssistAction* action = new TargetAssistAction();

      action->SetSwitchDelay(0); // Disable any delay for immediate target switching'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI behavior trees or combat logic systems.
    The delay value directly impacts the responsiveness of the AI's target switching
    mechanism and should be tuned based on desired gameplay balance.
