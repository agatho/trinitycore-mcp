documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NavMeshInterface class for pathfinding
    and navigation mesh management.
  description: The NavMeshInterface constructor initializes the navigation mesh interface,
    setting up internal data structures required for pathfinding and movement calculations
    within the game world. This class is typically used by AI systems, movement handlers,
    and navigation-related subsystems to calculate valid paths between points in the
    game environment. The initialization process includes allocating memory for navigation
    data, loading or generating the navigation mesh from map files, and preparing
    the interface for subsequent navigation queries. This constructor should be called
    before any pathfinding operations are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "NavMeshInterface* navInterface = new NavMeshInterface();\n// The interface\
      \ is now ready for pathfinding operations\nif (navInterface->IsInitialized())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with navigation queries\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor may perform heavy initialization work including loading
    large navigation mesh data from disk. It's recommended to initialize NavMeshInterface
    instances during server startup or map loading phases rather than during active
    gameplay to avoid performance hiccups. The interface maintains internal state
    that should not be accessed directly by external code.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance
    as it may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure proper cleanup with
    destructor when done using the interface. This class is typically managed by the
    TrinityCore subsystems and direct instantiation should be rare in normal gameplay
    code.
