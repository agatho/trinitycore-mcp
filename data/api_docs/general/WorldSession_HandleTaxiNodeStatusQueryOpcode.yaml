  method: HandleTaxiNodeStatusQueryOpcode
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleTaxiNodeStatusQueryOpcode(WorldPackets::Taxi::TaxiNodeStatusQuery
    & taxiNodeStatusQuery)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to query the status of a taxi node, determining
    if it's accessible and what flight paths are available.
  description: The HandleTaxiNodeStatusQueryOpcode method handles incoming opcode
    messages from the client requesting information about a specific taxi node. It
    determines whether the player can access the node based on their current quest
    progress, faction, and other game conditions. The method typically checks if the
    player has unlocked the taxi node or completed necessary prerequisites before
    allowing them to use flight paths originating from that node. This method is part
    of the core WorldSession handling for in-game transportation systems and ensures
    proper client-server synchronization of taxi network states.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleTaxiNodeStatusQueryOpcode(WorldPackets::Taxi::TaxiNodeStatusQuery&\
      \ taxiNodeStatusQuery)\n{\n    // Process the query for taxi node status\n \
      \   // Determine if player can access the node\n    // Send appropriate response\
      \ packet back to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player clicks on a taxi node in their
    UI or when the game needs to validate flight path availability. The implementation
    relies heavily on the player's quest log, faction standing, and other character
    state data. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a relatively lightweight
    operation that primarily involves database lookups and state checks.
