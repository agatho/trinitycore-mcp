  brief: Updates all player skills to match their current level
  description: The UpdateSkillsForLevel method adjusts a player's skill levels to
    be appropriate for their current character level. This method ensures that skills
    are properly scaled and updated when a player levels up or when their level changes
    in any way. It typically recalculates skill points, updates skill caps, and applies
    any level-based skill modifications. The method is automatically called during
    level-up events and character initialization, but can also be invoked manually
    to synchronize skill data with the current level state.

  examples:
  - title: Manual skill update after level change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateSkillsForLevel();

      // Skill levels are now synchronized with current player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the calculation and application of skill modifications
    based on the player's current level. It should not be called excessively during
    gameplay as it may trigger updates to multiple systems including skill points,
    spell learning, and equipment requirements.
