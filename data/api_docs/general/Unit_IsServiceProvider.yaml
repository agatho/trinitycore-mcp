  signature: bool Unit::IsServiceProvider() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a service provider for quests or NPCs.
  description: The IsServiceProvider method checks if the Unit object is currently
    acting as a service provider within the game context. This typically applies to
    NPCs that offer quest services or have specific NPC types that provide services
    such as vendors, trainers, or other service providers. The method returns true
    when the unit has the appropriate flags or attributes indicating it can provide
    services to players, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for
    determining which NPCs can be interacted with for service-related actions in World
    of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a service provider (e.g., vendor, trainer,
    quest giver), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsServiceProvider()) {\n    // Handle service provider logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other NPC-related checks
    to determine service eligibility. It may involve checking flags or attributes
    related to NPC types, and performance implications are minimal as it simply performs
    a flag check.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    NPC checks, as some NPCs may have multiple service roles (e.g., vendor and quest
    giver). Ensure proper categorization of service types to avoid misinterpretation.
