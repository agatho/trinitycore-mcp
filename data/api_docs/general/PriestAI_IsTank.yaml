api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: IsTank
  signature: bool PriestAI::IsTank(int * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the priest unit is assigned as a tank in the current encounter.
  description: The IsTank method evaluates if the PriestAI instance represents a unit
    that is currently acting as the primary tank for the group or encounter. This
    determination is typically based on the unit's role assignment, combat state,
    and positioning within the group dynamics. The method returns true if the priest
    is identified as the tank, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for
    AI decision-making in scenarios where specific actions should only be taken by
    the designated tank.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unit ID or index to check
      for tank status. This parameter may be used internally to identify which specific
      unit's tank status is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the specified unit is currently acting as a tank; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a priest is a tank
    code: "if (priestAI->IsTank(&unitId)) {\n    // Priest is currently the tank\n\
      \    DoTankSpecificBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Priest is not the tank\n  \
      \  DoNonTankBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may rely on internal state tracking of the unit's role within
    a group or encounter. It should be called with a valid unit ID to ensure accurate
    results.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit parameter points to a valid and active unit; otherwise,
    behavior is undefined. This method might not reflect real-time changes in tank
    status without proper synchronization.
