documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is charmed by a player or owned by a player.
  description: This method checks if the Unit object is currently under the control
    of a player through charm effects, or if it's owned by a player (such as a pet).
    The method returns true when the unit is either charmed by a player or owned by
    a player, indicating that the unit has a player as its master. This functionality
    is essential for determining the relationship between units and players in World
    of Warcraft's game mechanics, particularly in contexts involving pet management,
    control, and player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is charmed by a player or owned by a player; otherwise
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsCharmedOwnedByPlayerOrPlayer()) {\n    // Unit is controlled\
      \ by a player\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other control-related methods
    to determine the status of a unit. It's important to note that this method does
    not distinguish between being charmed versus owned; it simply checks if the unit
    has a player as its master.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking for player ownership,
    as it may return true even in cases where the unit is controlled by a player but
    not necessarily owned by one (e.g., when a player controls a creature via charm).
