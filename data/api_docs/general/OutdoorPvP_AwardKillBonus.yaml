  brief: Awards kill bonus to the player who has just killed an enemy in OutdoorPvP
    area
  description: The AwardKillBonus method is responsible for granting rewards to a
    player who has successfully killed an opponent within an OutdoorPvP zone. This
    method typically handles the distribution of honor points, reputation gains, and
    potentially other in-game currency or items based on the kill. It ensures that
    players are appropriately rewarded for their contributions to PvP activities outside
    of regular battlegrounds. The method likely checks if the player is eligible for
    rewards and applies appropriate bonuses according to the OutdoorPvP zone's rules
    and settings.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who has just achieved a kill in the
      OutdoorPvP area. This parameter represents the player receiving the bonus rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(4131);\nif (pvp)\n\
      {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get the player who killed an enemy\n    pvp->AwardKillBonus(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a kill
    event occurs in an OutdoorPvP zone. Developers should ensure that the player object
    passed to this method is valid and currently within the OutdoorPvP zone. The actual
    reward distribution logic may vary depending on the specific OutdoorPvP implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the player is in an active OutdoorPvP
    zone before invoking this function.
