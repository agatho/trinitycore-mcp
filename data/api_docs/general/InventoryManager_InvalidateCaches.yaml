documentation:
  brief: Invalidates all cached inventory data for the player
  description: The InvalidateCaches method clears all cached inventory information
    within the InventoryManager, ensuring that subsequent inventory operations will
    fetch fresh data from the underlying storage or database. This method is typically
    called when inventory state may have changed externally, such as after item modifications,
    trades, or server-side updates. It ensures consistency between the client's view
    and the actual inventory state in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Invalidation
    code: player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager()->InvalidateCaches();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may trigger expensive re-computation
    of inventory states. It's recommended to invalidate caches only when necessary,
    such as after significant inventory changes.
