  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetAspectShiftCooldown
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetAspectShiftCooldown()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cooldown time remaining for the Evoker's Aspect Shift ability.
  description: The GetAspectShiftCooldown method retrieves the current cooldown duration
    in milliseconds for the Evoker's Aspect Shift ability. This method is used by
    the EvokerAI class to determine when the player can next use this ability after
    it has been cast. The returned value represents the time remaining until the ability
    becomes available again, which is typically set based on the spell's cooldown
    period defined in the game's database or configuration files. This information
    is crucial for AI decision-making processes that involve managing ability usage
    timing and resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the milliseconds remaining until the Aspect
    Shift ability can be used again. Returns 0 if the ability is currently available
    for use.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Aspect Shift Cooldown Before Casting
    code: "if (evokerAI->GetAspectShiftCooldown() <= 0)\n{\n    // Aspect Shift is\
      \ available, proceed with casting\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_ASPECT_SHIFT);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Wait for cooldown to expire before using the ability\n  \
      \  uint32 cooldown = evokerAI->GetAspectShiftCooldown();\n    // Handle cooldown\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking mechanisms within
    the EvokerAI class. The returned value should be compared against zero to determine
    if the ability is ready for use. This method may be called frequently during AI
    update cycles, so performance considerations should be taken into account.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned cooldown value is properly interpreted as milliseconds
    and not seconds or other time units. Incorrect handling of this value could lead
    to abilities being used before their cooldowns have expired.
