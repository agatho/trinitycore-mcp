  class: HealthTrigger
  method: Check
  signature: bool HealthTrigger::Check(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a bot's health meets the conditions required for a specific
    trigger to activate.
  description: The Check method in the HealthTrigger class determines if the current
    state of a bot's health satisfies the criteria defined by the trigger. This method
    is typically used within AI decision-making logic to decide when to perform actions
    based on health thresholds. It accepts a pointer to a BotAI instance which provides
    access to the bot's current state and context, including health information. The
    method returns true if the health conditions are met, otherwise false. This functionality
    is essential for implementing adaptive AI behaviors that respond dynamically to
    changing combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's current health meets or exceeds the trigger's
    defined threshold, allowing the associated action to be executed; returns false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Trigger Check
    code: "if (healthTrigger.Check(ai)) {\n    // Execute healing or defensive action\n\
      \    ai->DoAction(ACTION_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the BotAI instance to provide accurate health data.
    The trigger's internal conditions must be properly configured before calling this
    method for meaningful results.
