  signature: void WmoLiquid::getPosInfo(uint32 & tilesX, uint32 & tilesY, int & corner)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the positional information of a WMO liquid, including tile dimensions
    and corner index.
  description: The getPosInfo method retrieves essential positional data for a WMO
    (World Map Object) liquid component. It provides the number of tiles in the X
    and Y directions, as well as the corner index that defines the liquid's orientation
    within its grid. This information is crucial for rendering and collision detection
    systems within the TrinityCore engine. The method does not modify any internal
    state and serves purely to expose the geometric properties of the liquid object.
    This data is typically used during map loading and rendering processes to properly
    position and display liquid effects such as water or lava in World of Warcraft
    environments.
  parameters:
  - name: tilesX
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the number
      of tiles along the X-axis for this WMO liquid
  - name: tilesY
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the number
      of tiles along the Y-axis for this WMO liquid
  - name: corner
    description: Reference to an int variable that will be filled with the corner
      index defining the liquid's orientation within its tile grid (typically 0-3
      representing different rotation states)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WmoLiquid* liquid = ...; // Assume this is a valid WMO liquid pointer

      uint32 tilesX, tilesY;

      int corner;

      liquid->getPosInfo(tilesX, tilesY, corner);

      // Now tilesX, tilesY, and corner contain the positional information'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Rendering Context
    code: "void RenderLiquid(WmoLiquid* liquid) {\n    uint32 tilesX, tilesY;\n  \
      \  int corner;\n    liquid->getPosInfo(tilesX, tilesY, corner);\n    \n    //\
      \ Use the tile dimensions and corner for rendering calculations\n    float width\
      \ = tilesX * TILE_SIZE;\n    float height = tilesY * TILE_SIZE;\n    \n    //\
      \ Apply corner rotation if needed for proper orientation\n    switch(corner)\
      \ {\n        case 0: /* No rotation */ break;\n        case 1: /* 90 degree\
      \ rotation */ break;\n        case 2: /* 180 degree rotation */ break;\n   \
      \     case 3: /* 270 degree rotation */ break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WMO liquid handling system in TrinityCore and
    is typically called during map loading or rendering passes. The corner index represents
    rotational orientation data that affects how the liquid surface is rendered within
    its tile grid. This information is critical for accurate terrain and liquid alignment
    in World of Warcraft's 3D environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the WmoLiquid object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing unallocated memory could lead to undefined behavior.
    The parameters are passed by reference and will be overwritten upon successful
    execution.
