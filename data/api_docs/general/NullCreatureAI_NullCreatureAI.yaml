  signature: void NullCreatureAI::NullCreatureAI(int * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a null creature AI instance with specified script identifier
  description: The NullCreatureAI constructor initializes a creature AI instance that
    performs no actions. This class serves as a placeholder or default implementation
    for creatures that do not require custom AI behavior. The method accepts a creature
    pointer and script identifier to set up the AI context, though it does not perform
    any actual AI logic. This is commonly used for creatures that are meant to be
    non-aggressive or have minimal interaction with players.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the creature object that this AI will manage. Must be
      a valid creature instance or null.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Identifier for the script associated with this creature AI. Used
      to determine which script logic should apply, though this implementation does
      nothing with it.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic NullCreatureAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // some valid creature instance

      int scriptId = 12345;

      NullCreatureAI aiInstance(myCreature, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This implementation is typically used as a base class or fallback when no
    specific AI behavior is required. It does not perform any actions during creature
    updates or combat events, making it suitable for stationary or passive NPCs.
