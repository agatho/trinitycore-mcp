  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: LearningMetrics BehaviorAdaptation::GetMetrics(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves learning metrics for a specified bot GUID from the BehaviorAdaptation
    system.
  description: The GetMetrics method retrieves the current learning metrics associated
    with a specific bot identified by its GUID. These metrics typically include data
    about the bot's adaptation behavior, training progress, and performance indicators
    within the AI learning framework of TrinityCore. The method is designed to provide
    insights into how well a bot has adapted to its environment or tasks over time.
    It operates as a read-only accessor that returns a copy of the internal LearningMetrics
    structure for the given bot. This functionality is crucial for monitoring and
    analyzing AI behavior in automated gameplay scenarios, such as quest completion,
    combat tactics, or skill acquisition.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose learning metrics are
      to be retrieved. Must be a valid GUID corresponding to an existing bot within
      the system.
  returns: A copy of the LearningMetrics structure containing detailed information
    about the bot's adaptation behavior, training progress, and performance indicators.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized LearningMetrics object if no data is found
    for the specified bot GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Metrics for a Specific Bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      LearningMetrics metrics = adaptation.GetMetrics(botGuid);

      // Use metrics to analyze bot behavior

      std::cout << "Bot learning progress: " << metrics.progress << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Bot Adaptation Status
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nBehaviorAdaptation*\
      \ adaptation = sWorld->GetBehaviorAdaptation();\nif (adaptation)\n{\n    LearningMetrics\
      \ metrics = adaptation->GetMetrics(botGuid);\n    if (metrics.IsValid())\n \
      \   {\n        // Process valid metrics\n        printf(\"Adaptation Score:\
      \ %.2f\\n\", metrics.adaptationScore);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the
    BehaviorAdaptation class. It performs a lookup operation based on the provided
    GUID, which may involve internal data structures like maps or containers. For
    optimal performance, avoid frequent calls in tight loops unless necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to an actual existing bot;
    otherwise, the returned metrics will be invalid or default-initialized. This method
    assumes that the bot has been properly initialized within the BehaviorAdaptation
    system before calling.
