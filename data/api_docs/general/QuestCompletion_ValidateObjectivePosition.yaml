  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ValidateObjectivePosition
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::ValidateObjectivePosition(const int & position,
    const QuestObjectiveData & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a given position meets the requirements of a quest objective.
  description: The ValidateObjectivePosition method checks whether a specified position
    adheres to the constraints defined by a quest objective. This validation is crucial
    for determining if a player's actions or location fulfill the conditions required
    to progress through a quest. The method evaluates the provided position against
    the objective's data, including any positional requirements such as proximity
    to NPCs, specific coordinates, or area boundaries. It ensures that quest completion
    logic correctly interprets whether a given point in the game world satisfies the
    objective criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: position
    description: An integer representing the position identifier or index within the
      quest objective's context. This could correspond to a specific waypoint, target
      location, or step in a multi-step objective sequence.
  - name: objective
    description: A reference to the QuestObjectiveData structure containing all relevant
      information about the quest objective being validated. This includes type, required
      conditions, and positional constraints that must be satisfied.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position meets all validation criteria defined
    by the quest objective; otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically
    indicates that the player's current position does not satisfy the objective's
    requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "if (questCompletion.ValidateObjectivePosition(3, questObjectiveData)) {\n\
      \    // Position 3 satisfies the objective\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Position 3 does not satisfy the objective\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Position does not meet objective requirements.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Multi-Step Objective Validation
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < totalSteps; ++i) {\n    if (!questCompletion.ValidateObjectivePosition(i,\
      \ questObjectiveData)) {\n        // One of the steps failed validation\n  \
      \      player->SendNotification(\"Quest step incomplete.\");\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n}\nplayer->CompleteQuest(questId);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during quest progression checks and may
    be used in conjunction with other validation routines to ensure full compliance
    with quest requirements. The position parameter might represent different concepts
    depending on the objective type, such as a waypoint index or a specific coordinate
    within a zone.
  warnings: Ensure that the position value passed corresponds to valid indices or
    locations relevant to the objective data. Passing invalid position values may
    lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect validation results.
