documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the spell visual ID associated with the aura creation
    info.
  description: The CalcSpellVisual method determines the appropriate spell visual
    identifier for an aura based on its configuration. This value is used by the client
    to display the correct visual effects when the aura is applied to a unit. The
    calculation takes into account various aura properties such as spell ID, caster,
    and aura application context. This method is typically invoked during aura application
    or update processes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell visual ID that should be used for displaying
    the aura's visual effect. Returns 0 if no valid visual is configured or applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: "AuraCreateInfo auraInfo;\n// ... set up aura info ...\nint visualId = auraInfo.CalcSpellVisual();\n\
      if (visualId > 0)\n{\n    // Apply visual effect using visualId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system and should not be
    called directly in most user-facing code. The result may vary depending on the
    specific spell and aura type being processed. Performance is generally negligible
    as this is a simple calculation based on existing aura data.
