documentation:
  brief: Stores symbol information for exception handling and debugging purposes
  description: The StoreSymbol method is used to record symbol information related
    to memory addresses within the TrinityCore application. This functionality is
    typically employed during crash reporting or debugging sessions to map memory
    offsets back to human-readable function names, file locations, and line numbers.
    The method accepts a symbol type and offset parameters to categorize and store
    debugging information that can be later retrieved for generating meaningful stack
    traces or crash reports. It plays a crucial role in the WheatyExceptionReport
    class's ability to provide detailed diagnostic information when application crashes
    occur.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of symbol to store, typically indicating the category or
      nature of the symbol (e.g., function, variable, or code segment). Valid values
      are implementation-specific but generally correspond to standard debugging symbol
      types used by the Windows debugging infrastructure.
  - name: offset
    description: The memory offset value representing the address location within
      the application's memory space. This offset is usually a relative virtual address
      (RVA) that points to a specific location in the executable code or data structures
      where the symbol information applies.
  returns: Returns true if the symbol was successfully stored, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if storage fails due to memory constraints, invalid parameters,
    or internal errors within the exception reporting system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Symbol Storage
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport report;\nDWORD_PTR address = 0x12345678;\nbool success\
      \ = report.StoreSymbol(SYMBOL_FUNCTION, address);\nif (success) {\n    // Symbol\
      \ stored successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Storing Multiple Symbols
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport report;\nDWORD_PTR offsets[] = {0x1000, 0x2000, 0x3000};\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n    report.StoreSymbol(SYMBOL_CODE, offsets[i]);\n\
      }\n// All symbols stored in the exception report"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the exception handling framework and should only be
    called during crash reporting or debugging scenarios. The symbol storage mechanism
    relies on Windows debugging APIs and may require proper symbol files (.pdb) to
    be available for meaningful results. Performance considerations include memory
    allocation overhead when storing large numbers of symbols.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid offset values or incorrect symbol types
    may lead to corrupted exception reports or crashes. Ensure that all parameters
    are validated before calling this method, especially in high-frequency scenarios
    such as real-time debugging.
