  signature: uint32_t PolicyNetwork::SampleAction(const int & state)
documentation:
  brief: Samples an action from the policy network given a current state
  description: The SampleAction method performs action selection based on the current
    state using the policy network's internal decision-making mechanism. It takes
    a discrete state representation as input and returns a sampled action index according
    to the policy distribution. This method is typically used in reinforcement learning
    contexts within the TrinityCore AI framework, where NPCs or game entities need
    to make decisions based on their current environmental state. The sampling process
    may involve exploration strategies such as epsilon-greedy or softmax selection
    depending on the implementation details of the policy network.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: An integer representing the current discrete state of the environment
      or agent. This value is used as input to determine which action to sample from
      the policy distribution.
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the index of the sampled action. The returned
    value corresponds to a valid action in the action space defined for this policy
    network, with values typically ranging from 0 to N-1 where N is the number of
    possible actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Sampling
    code: 'int currentState = 5;

      uint32_t selectedAction = policyNetwork.SampleAction(currentState);

      // selectedAction now contains a sampled action index based on state 5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SampleAction in AI Decision Loop
    code: "class NPCAI {\n    PolicyNetwork policyNet;\npublic:\n    void Update()\
      \ {\n        int state = GetEnvironmentState();\n        uint32_t action = policyNet.SampleAction(state);\n\
      \        ExecuteAction(action);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PolicyNetwork has been properly initialized
    and trained before calling. The state parameter should be within the expected
    range for the policy network's input space. Implementation may include internal
    caching or random number generation which could affect reproducibility unless
    deterministic seeding is used.
  warnings: Ensure that the input state is valid and within expected bounds to avoid
    undefined behavior. Repeated calls with identical states may produce different
    results due to stochastic sampling, which can be important for training stability
    in reinforcement learning scenarios.
