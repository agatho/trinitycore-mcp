  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: SetFormationManager
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetFormationManager(FormationManager
    * mgr)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation manager for role-based combat positioning.
  description: The SetFormationManager method assigns a FormationManager instance
    to the RoleBasedCombatPositioning class, enabling it to utilize formation-based
    positioning logic during combat. This allows the AI to coordinate group member
    placements according to predefined formations, which is essential for maintaining
    tactical positioning in group encounters. The method typically gets called during
    initialization or when switching between different combat strategies that require
    specific formation setups.
  parameters:
  - name: mgr
    description: Pointer to a FormationManager instance that will be used for managing
      combat formations. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;

      FormationManager* formationMgr = new FormationManager();

      positioning.SetFormationManager(formationMgr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class MyAI : public RoleBasedCombatPositioning {\npublic:\n    void InitializeFormation()\
      \ {\n        FormationManager* fm = sFormationMgr->GetFormationForGroup(GetGroup());\n\
      \        SetFormationManager(fm);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the input pointer; it is assumed
    that the caller has ensured the FormationManager instance is valid and properly
    initialized. The RoleBasedCombatPositioning class will take ownership of the pointer,
    so care should be taken to avoid double deletion.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes during runtime. Always ensure that the FormationManager object exists
    and is in a valid state before calling this method.
