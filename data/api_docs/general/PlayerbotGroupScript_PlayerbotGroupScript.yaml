documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerbotGroupScript class for managing
    group-based player bot behavior in TrinityCore.
  description: The PlayerbotGroupScript constructor initializes the necessary internal
    state and data structures required for handling group-based actions and decisions
    for player bots within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the script's
    context, including references to the player bot's group membership, group leader
    information, and other relevant group-related data needed for coordinated bot
    behavior. The initialization ensures that the script can properly respond to group
    events such as member joins/leaves, leader changes, and group-based AI decisions.
    This constructor is typically invoked automatically when a new player bot instance
    is created or when a bot joins a group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Default Construction
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupScript* groupScript = new PlayerbotGroupScript();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal state

      // for handling group-based bot behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the player bot system's core infrastructure and
    should not be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked during
    the creation of player bot instances within the TrinityCore AI framework. The
    initialization process may involve setting up event listeners for group changes
    and establishing references to the associated player bot's group data.
