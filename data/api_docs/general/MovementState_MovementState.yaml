documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MovementState object with default values.
  description: The MovementState constructor initializes a new instance of the MovementState
    class, setting up internal state variables to their default values. This constructor
    is typically used when creating movement-related objects for handling player or
    creature movement logic within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization ensures
    that all movement properties are properly configured before any movement operations
    are performed. This method does not require any parameters and prepares the object
    for subsequent movement state updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MovementState instance
    code: 'MovementState* state = new MovementState();

      // The MovementState object is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be used for movement handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the MovementState class which is typically used
    internally by TrinityCore's movement system. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless working at a low-level movement system level. The default initialization
    sets all movement flags and state variables to their neutral/initial states.
