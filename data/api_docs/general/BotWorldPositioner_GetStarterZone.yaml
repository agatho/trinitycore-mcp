  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: GetStarterZone
  signature: ZoneChoice BotWorldPositioner::GetStarterZone(uint8 race, int faction)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the appropriate starter zone for a player based on their race
    and faction.
  description: The GetStarterZone method selects the correct starting zone for a player
    character in the World of Warcraft environment, considering both their racial
    background and faction alignment. This method is typically used during character
    creation or respawn scenarios to ensure players begin their adventure in an appropriate
    location. The selection process takes into account predefined mappings between
    races, factions, and corresponding starter zones within the game world. It serves
    as a core component for initializing player positions at the beginning of their
    gameplay experience.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the player character (e.g., Human, Orc, Night
      Elf). This value determines which starter zone is selected based on race-specific
      starting locations.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the player character (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde).
      This parameter influences the final zone choice by selecting between faction-specific
      starting areas.
  returns: A ZoneChoice object that represents the selected starter zone. The ZoneChoice
    typically contains information about the zone ID, coordinates, and other relevant
    data needed to initialize a player's starting position in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for Alliance Human
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      ZoneChoice choice = positioner.GetStarterZone(RACE_HUMAN, 0); // 0 represents
      Alliance

      // Returns the starter zone for Alliance Humans'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage for Horde Orc
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      ZoneChoice choice = positioner.GetStarterZone(RACE_ORC, 1); // 1 represents
      Horde

      // Returns the starter zone for Horde Orcs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game data tables that map races and factions
    to specific zones. The implementation may vary depending on the expansion or patch
    level of the TrinityCore instance. It is recommended to validate the returned
    ZoneChoice before using it to initialize player positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the race and faction parameters are valid values; invalid
    inputs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect zone selection. This method
    should not be called during active gameplay sessions where players might already
    be in the world, as it's designed for initial character setup only.
