  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SearchUnitInCylinder
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SearchUnitInCylinder(const int & cylinder, int & targetList)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for units within a specified cylindrical area around the area trigger
    and populates a target list with found units.
  description: The SearchUnitInCylinder method performs a spatial search to identify
    all units (players, creatures, etc.) that are located within a defined cylindrical
    volume centered on the area trigger's position. This functionality is commonly
    used in game mechanics such as area-of-effect spells, traps, or environmental
    effects where certain actions should only affect targets within a specific radius
    and height range. The method modifies the provided targetList parameter to include
    the GUIDs of all matching units. It does not return any value directly but updates
    the list passed by reference. This operation typically involves checking unit
    positions against the cylinder's boundaries using distance calculations in 3D
    space.
  parameters:
  - name: cylinder
    description: An integer identifier or index representing a predefined cylindrical
      area definition, possibly referencing a database entry or configuration value
      that defines the radius and height of the search zone.
  - name: targetList
    description: A reference to an integer variable that will be updated with the
      list of unit GUIDs found within the specified cylinder. The actual implementation
      may require this to be a container like std::vector<uint64_t> or similar, but
      as per signature it's passed as int&.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SearchUnitInCylinder
    code: 'int cylinderId = 5;

      int targetList = 0; // Assuming this is a placeholder for a container or list

      areaTrigger->SearchUnitInCylinder(cylinderId, targetList);

      // After execution, targetList contains the GUIDs of units in the cylinder'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the area trigger has been properly initialized and
    positioned in the world. The 'cylinder' parameter likely refers to a configuration
    or database index rather than a direct geometric definition, so developers should
    ensure proper mapping between indices and actual cylinder properties. Performance
    may vary depending on how many units are within the search radius.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the targetList reference could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect targeting results. Ensure that any container used for storing
    the GUIDs is properly initialized before calling this method, especially if it's
    expected to be a collection type rather than a single integer.
