  method: IsConstant
  signature: bool Channel::IsConstant() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the channel is a constant channel that cannot be left
    by players.
  description: The IsConstant method checks if the channel is marked as constant,
    meaning it persists across player sessions and cannot be left or removed by regular
    players. Constant channels are typically used for system-wide communications such
    as global announcements or server-wide messages. This method returns true if the
    channel is constant, false otherwise. The check is performed against an internal
    flag set during channel creation or configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the channel is a constant channel that cannot be left by
    players, false if it's a regular channel that can be left.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a channel is constant before joining
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel && channel->IsConstant()) {\n    // Handle constant channel logic\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"This is a constant\
      \ channel.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple flag check and has no performance implications.
    It's safe to call from any thread context as it only reads immutable flags.
