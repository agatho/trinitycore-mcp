  signature: void GuildIntegration::HandleGuildLeaving(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the process of a player leaving their guild, updating guild membership
    and related data.
  description: The HandleGuildLeaving method is responsible for managing the removal
    of a player from their current guild in the TrinityCore server environment. This
    method ensures that all necessary cleanup operations are performed when a player
    decides to leave their guild, including updating internal guild member lists,
    removing guild-specific permissions and benefits, and potentially notifying other
    guild members of the departure. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the player's identifier and performs the required actions to cleanly remove the
    player from the guild structure. This functionality is part of the broader guild
    management system within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the player leaving the guild. The integer should correspond to a valid player
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.HandleGuildLeaving(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database operations to persist changes
    to the guild membership structure. It may also trigger notifications or events
    related to guild management. Developers should ensure that the player identifier
    passed is valid and corresponds to an active player in the game world.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent player ID could lead to undefined behavior
    or database inconsistencies. This method should only be called when a player has
    actually decided to leave their guild, not during arbitrary game events.
