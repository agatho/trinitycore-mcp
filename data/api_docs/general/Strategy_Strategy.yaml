documentation:
  brief: Initializes a strategy with the specified name for AI behavior control.
  description: The Strategy constructor initializes a new strategy object with the
    given name, which is used to define AI behavior patterns in TrinityCore's AI system.
    This method sets up the internal state of the strategy, allowing it to be registered
    and utilized by various AI components within the game engine. The name parameter
    serves as a unique identifier for the strategy, enabling different AI behaviors
    to be selected and managed dynamically during runtime. This initialization is
    crucial for proper integration with the core AI framework and ensures that the
    strategy can be correctly referenced when determining NPC behavior.

    code: Strategy* myStrategy = new Strategy("AggressiveCombat");
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during AI module initialization or when
    dynamically creating new strategy instances. The name parameter should be unique
    to avoid conflicts in the strategy registry. This method does not perform any
    validation on the name string, so developers should ensure proper naming conventions
    are followed.
