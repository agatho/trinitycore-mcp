  class: BotCustomizationGenerator
  method: GetCacheKey
  signature: uint64 BotCustomizationGenerator::GetCacheKey(uint8 race, uint8 gender)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique cache key based on race and gender for bot customization
    data.
  description: The GetCacheKey method computes a 64-bit hash value that uniquely identifies
    a combination of race and gender for bot customization purposes. This cache key
    is used internally by the BotCustomizationGenerator class to store and retrieve
    predefined bot appearance settings. The method takes two parameters representing
    the player's race and gender, which are combined into a single uint64 value suitable
    for use as a lookup key in hash-based data structures. This approach ensures that
    different race-gender combinations produce distinct cache keys, preventing collisions
    in customization data retrieval.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the bot (e.g., Human, Orc, Night Elf). Valid values
      typically correspond to the constants defined in TrinityCore's Race enum.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot (0 for male, 1 for female). This parameter
      determines the gender-specific customization data to be retrieved.
  returns: A unique 64-bit integer value that serves as a cache key for bot customization
    data. Each unique combination of race and gender produces a distinct return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint64 cacheKey = generator.GetCacheKey(RACE_HUMAN, GENDER_MALE); // Returns
      a unique key for human male bots
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Bot Customization System
    code: 'uint8 race = player->getRace();

      uint8 gender = player->getGender();

      uint64 key = generator.GetCacheKey(race, gender);

      CustomizationData* data = cache->Get(key); // Retrieve customization data using
      the generated key'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method uses a simple bit manipulation approach to combine race and gender
    values into a single 64-bit integer. The implementation assumes that race and
    gender values are within valid ranges (typically 0-255 for each). This cache key
    generation is designed to be fast and collision-free for the expected input domain.
  warnings: Ensure that the race and gender parameters are validated before calling
    this method, as invalid values may produce unexpected or non-unique cache keys.
    The method does not perform any bounds checking on input parameters.
