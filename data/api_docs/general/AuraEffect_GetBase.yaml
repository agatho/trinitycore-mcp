  method: GetBase
  signature: Aura * AuraEffect::GetBase() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base Aura object that this AuraEffect belongs to
  description: The GetBase method retrieves a pointer to the parent Aura object that
    contains this specific AuraEffect. In World of Warcraft's aura system, an Aura
    is a container for multiple effects (AuraEffects), and each effect references
    its parent aura. This method allows developers to access the overarching aura
    properties and state from within a specific effect handler. The returned pointer
    is typically valid as long as the aura is active and has not been removed from
    the target.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Aura object that owns this AuraEffect, or nullptr if the
    effect is not associated with any aura
  examples:
  - title: Accessing parent aura from effect handler
    code: "void OnApply(AuraEffect const* aurEff, AuraEffectHandleModes mode)\n{\n\
      \    Aura* baseAura = aurEff->GetBase();\n    if (baseAura)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Access aura properties\n        Unit* caster = baseAura->GetCaster();\n\
      \        SpellInfo const* spellInfo = baseAura->GetSpellInfo();\n        //\
      \ ... process aura data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking aura type from effect
    code: "void OnPeriodic(AuraEffect const* aurEff)\n{\n    Aura* baseAura = aurEff->GetBase();\n\
      \    if (baseAura && baseAura->GetSpellInfo()->IsPositive())\n    {\n      \
      \  // Handle positive aura effects\n        // ... implementation\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in aura effect handlers to access the broader
    context of the aura that triggered the effect. The returned Aura pointer should
    be checked for null before use, as effects may be detached from their parent aura
    during removal or destruction phases.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the scope of the current handler
    function, as the aura might be destroyed while the effect is still active. Always
    verify that the returned pointer is valid before dereferencing it.
