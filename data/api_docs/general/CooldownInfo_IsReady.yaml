  class: CooldownInfo
  method: IsReady
  signature: bool CooldownInfo::IsReady() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a cooldown period has completed and the associated ability is ready
    to be used again.
  description: The IsReady method determines whether a cooldown timer for a specific
    ability or item has finished. It evaluates the internal state of the CooldownInfo
    object, which tracks when an ability last became available. This method is commonly
    used in game logic to prevent players from using abilities before their cooldowns
    expire. The check is typically performed before allowing an action to proceed,
    ensuring adherence to game balance and timing mechanics. This function does not
    modify any internal state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cooldown period has elapsed and the ability/item is
    ready for use; returns false if the cooldown is still active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (cooldownInfo.IsReady()) {\n    // Allow spell to be cast\n    CastSpell();\n\
      } else {\n    // Inform player cooldown is active\n    SendCooldownMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Cooldowns
    code: "bool canUseAbility = cooldown1.IsReady() && cooldown2.IsReady() && cooldown3.IsReady();\n\
      if (canUseAbility) {\n    // All cooldowns ready, perform action\n    ExecuteComboAttack();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate time tracking and should be called frequently
    enough to reflect real-time cooldown progression. The implementation assumes that
    the underlying time source is synchronized with the game's internal clock.
