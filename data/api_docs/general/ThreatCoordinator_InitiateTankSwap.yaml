  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: InitiateTankSwap
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::InitiateTankSwap(int fromTank, int toTank)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a tank swap between two threat positions in the ThreatCoordinator
    system.
  description: The InitiateTankSwap method is responsible for managing threat transitions
    between tank roles within the ThreatCoordinator framework. This method facilitates
    the process of switching which mob or NPC is currently holding aggro from one
    tank to another, ensuring proper threat distribution and maintaining balanced
    combat dynamics. It typically involves updating internal threat tables, notifying
    involved parties (such as AI controllers or combatants), and potentially triggering
    related events like threat recalculations or unit state changes. The method assumes
    that the fromTank and toTank parameters refer to valid tank identifiers within
    the current context of the threat coordinator.
  parameters:
  - name: fromTank
    description: The identifier of the tank whose threat position is being relinquished.
      This value should correspond to a valid tank instance in the current combat
      scenario.
  - name: toTank
    description: The identifier of the tank who will assume the threat position previously
      held by fromTank. This must also be a valid tank identifier within the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Swap Initiation
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitiateTankSwap(1, 2); // Transfer threat from tank 1 to tank 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Tank Swap Based on Conditions
    code: "if (player->GetHealthPct() < 30)\n{\n    coordinator.InitiateTankSwap(currentTankId,\
      \ newTankId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables related to threat tracking
    and should be called only when the system is in a stable state. It may trigger
    additional callbacks or event handlers depending on how the ThreatCoordinator
    is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that both fromTank and toTank are valid identifiers before calling
    this function; otherwise, undefined behavior might occur. Also, avoid calling
    this method during active combat processing cycles to prevent race conditions
    or inconsistent threat states.
