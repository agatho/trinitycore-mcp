  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetBestEchoTarget
  signature: int * EvokerAI::GetBestEchoTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal target for the Evoker's Echo ability based
    on threat, health, and proximity.
  description: The GetBestEchoTarget method evaluates available targets within the
    Evoker's current aggro range and selects the most suitable candidate for casting
    the Echo spell. This selection process considers factors such as target threat
    level, health percentage, and distance from the Evoker to ensure optimal gameplay
    balance and effectiveness of the ability. The method is typically invoked during
    AI decision-making cycles when the Evoker needs to determine which enemy should
    receive the Echo effect. It returns a pointer to an integer representing the target's
    unique identifier (GUID), or nullptr if no valid target exists within range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best target for Echo,
    or nullptr if no suitable target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = evokerAI->GetBestEchoTarget()) {\n    // Cast Echo\
      \ on the selected target\n    evoker->CastSpell(*targetGuid, SPELL_ECHO, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // No valid target found, handle accordingly\n    evoker->Say(\"\
      No target for Echo!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's AI behavior system and should only be
    called during active combat situations where targeting decisions are required.
    The returned pointer is valid only until the next AI update cycle or until the
    target dies or becomes invalid.
  warnings: Do not dereference the returned pointer without checking for null first,
    as it may return nullptr if no suitable target exists. Additionally, ensure that
    the target remains valid and within range when using the GUID returned by this
    method.
