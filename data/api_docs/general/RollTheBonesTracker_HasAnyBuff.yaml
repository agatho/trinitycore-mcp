  signature: bool RollTheBonesTracker::HasAnyBuff() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has any active Roll the Bones buff.
  description: The HasAnyBuff method determines whether the player currently possesses
    any active buffs from the Roll the Bones ability. This tracker is used in conjunction
    with the Shadowlands legendary item set and associated mechanics. The method evaluates
    all possible buff states that can be applied through Roll the Bones, including
    various damage and utility enhancements. It returns true if at least one of these
    buffs is currently active on the player, and false otherwise. This check is typically
    performed during combat or when evaluating the effectiveness of the legendary's
    passive abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has any active Roll the Bones buff; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetRollTheBonesTracker()->HasAnyBuff()) {\n    // Player has\
      \ at least one active Roll the Bones buff\n    // Perform actions based on this\
      \ state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Buff Check
    code: "RollTheBonesTracker* tracker = player->GetRollTheBonesTracker();\nif (tracker\
      \ && tracker->HasAnyBuff()) {\n    // Player is benefiting from Roll the Bones\
      \ effects\n    // Can be used to modify spell damage, apply additional mechanics,\
      \ etc.\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_ROLL_THE_BONES_ACTIVE_EFFECT, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only checks for active buffs and does not account for cooldowns
    or resource costs. The implementation likely uses internal tracking flags or aura
    references to determine buff status. Performance is generally low as it involves
    simple state checking rather than complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the RollTheBonesTracker pointer is valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. This check
    should be performed in contexts where the player may not have the legendary item
    equipped or when the tracker might not be initialized.
