  class: PositionManager
  method: ClearExpiredZones
  signature: void PositionManager::ClearExpiredZones(uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Clears expired zone data from the position manager's internal tracking system.
  description: The ClearExpiredZones method removes outdated zone information from
    the PositionManager's internal data structures. This function is typically called
    periodically to maintain performance and ensure that stale zone data does not
    interfere with current player positioning or zone-based gameplay mechanics. The
    method iterates through all tracked zones and removes those that have exceeded
    their valid time window, which helps prevent memory leaks and ensures accurate
    zone-related functionality such as area triggers, zone-based events, and player
    state management. It operates on a provided current time value to determine what
    constitutes an 'expired' zone entry.
  parameters:
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current system timestamp used to determine which zones have expired.
      This value represents the number of milliseconds since epoch and is used to
      compare against zone expiration timestamps stored internally.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    positionManager.ClearExpiredZones(currentTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with zone update system
    code: "class ZoneUpdateSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        uint32\
      \ currentTime = Time::GetGameTimeMS();\n        positionManager.ClearExpiredZones(currentTime);\n\
      \        // Additional zone processing logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game thread and should
    not be invoked concurrently with other PositionManager operations. The internal
    implementation likely uses a time-based expiration mechanism where each zone entry
    has an associated timestamp that gets compared against the provided currentTime
    parameter.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or outdated time values may result
    in premature removal of valid zone entries or failure to remove expired ones,
    potentially causing gameplay inconsistencies or performance issues. Ensure that
    the currentTime parameter accurately reflects the current game time.
