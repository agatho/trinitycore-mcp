  class: Unit
  method: GetNativeObjectScale
  signature: float Unit::GetNativeObjectScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the native scale factor of the unit object.
  description: This method retrieves the native scale factor associated with a Unit
    object, which represents the base scale used for the object's visual representation
    in the game world. The scale factor is typically used to determine how large an
    object appears relative to its actual size in the game world. This value is often
    used in conjunction with other scaling mechanisms to ensure proper visual representation
    of creatures, players, or game objects within the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the native scale factor of the unit
    object, typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents normal scale and
    values less than 1.0 indicate smaller visual representation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float scale = unit->GetNativeObjectScale();

      // This will return the native scale factor for the unit object

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other scaling methods to
    determine visual representation of objects. The value returned may vary depending
    on the type of unit (player, creature, etc.) and its specific properties within
    the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always reflect the actual
    scale used for rendering in-game. Some objects may have different scale factors
    based on their internal properties or game mechanics.
