  brief: Modifies the stack count of a spell aura effect.
  description: This method adjusts the number of stacks applied to a spell aura effect,
    typically used in conjunction with aura applications. It allows for modifying
    the current stack count of an aura, which can be useful for adjusting the strength
    or duration of effects based on various game mechanics such as stacking rules,
    buff durations, or specific spell interactions. The method operates within the
    context of spell handling and does not directly affect the player's status or
    other external systems.

  - title: Modify Aura Stacks Example
    code: "void Spell::EffectModifyAuraStacks()\n{\n    // Implementation example\n\
      \    if (m_spellInfo->HasAura(20345))\n    {\n        // Modify stack count\n\
      \        m_spellInfo->SetStackAmount(5);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell processing or when applying
    aura effects. It requires proper handling of the spell's aura and should be used
    carefully to avoid unintended consequences in gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect stacking behavior, potentially
    causing game balance issues or unexpected visual effects. Ensure that stack modifications
    align with game rules and do not violate existing stack limits.
