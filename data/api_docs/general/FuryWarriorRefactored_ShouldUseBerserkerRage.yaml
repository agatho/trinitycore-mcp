  signature: bool FuryWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseBerserkerRage() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Fury Warrior should activate Berserker Rage based
    on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: This method evaluates the current state of the Fury Warrior to decide
    if using the Berserker Rage ability would be beneficial. It considers factors
    such as available rage, current target threat level, and combat duration. The
    function is typically used within the AI decision-making loop to determine optimal
    ability usage for maximizing damage output during Fury warrior combat. This method
    does not directly cast the spell but returns a boolean value indicating whether
    the condition for casting Berserker Rage is met.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Fury Warrior should use Berserker Rage, false otherwise.
    The decision is based on internal combat state checks including rage availability
    and tactical positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warrior->ShouldUseBerserkerRage()) {\n    warrior->CastSpell(BERSERKER_RAGE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldUseBerserkerRage())\
      \ {\n        // Activate Berserker Rage for increased attack speed\n       \
      \ CastSpell(BERSERKER_RAGE_SPELL_ID);\n    }\n    // Continue with other AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Fury Warrior's core combat decision engine and
    should be called frequently during combat updates. The implementation likely checks
    for sufficient rage (typically 10+ rage points) and evaluates if Berserker Rage
    will provide a meaningful benefit in the current tactical situation.
  warnings: Do not directly cast Berserker Rage based solely on this method's return
    value without verifying that the spell is not on cooldown or otherwise unavailable.
    This method does not account for global cooldowns or other spell restrictions.
