  method: WriteUpdate
  signature: void GameObjectAssistActionData::WriteUpdate(ByteBuffer & data, bool
    ignoreChangesMask, const GameObject * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes update data for a game object assist action to a byte buffer.
  description: The WriteUpdate method serializes the state and properties of a GameObjectAssistActionData
    instance into a ByteBuffer, which is typically used for sending updates to players
    in the game world. This method allows for efficient network transmission of game
    object state changes, ensuring that clients receive accurate information about
    assist actions related to game objects. The serialization process respects change
    masks when ignoreChangesMask is false, only including fields that have changed
    since the last update. When ignoreChangesMask is true, all fields are written
    regardless of their change status. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    packet handling system for updating client-side representations of game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized update data will be
      written. This buffer is typically used to construct network packets sent to
      players.
  - name: ignoreChangesMask
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to ignore change tracking masks.
      If true, all fields are written to the buffer regardless of their change status.
      If false, only changed fields are serialized.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that owns this assist action data. Used
      to access object properties and state for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive this update. May be used to
      determine specific field visibility or client-specific formatting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      GameObjectAssistActionData assistData;

      GameObject* gameObject = ...; // Get game object

      Player* player = ...; // Get receiving player

      assistData.WriteUpdate(data, false, gameObject, player);

      // Send data through packet system'
    language: cpp
  - title: Force update with ignore mask
    code: 'ByteBuffer fullUpdate;

      GameObjectAssistActionData assistData;

      GameObject* obj = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      assistData.WriteUpdate(fullUpdate, true, obj, receiver);

      // Send complete state regardless of changes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's object update system and should be called
    during the packet preparation phase. The implementation likely uses bitmasks to
    track field changes efficiently. Developers should ensure proper synchronization
    when accessing GameObject state from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GameObject or Player pointer may result
    in undefined behavior. The ByteBuffer must be properly initialized before calling
    this method. When ignoreChangesMask is true, performance may degrade due to unnecessary
    serialization of unchanged fields.
