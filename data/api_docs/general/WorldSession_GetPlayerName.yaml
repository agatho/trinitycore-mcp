documentation:
  brief: Returns the current player's name associated with this session
  description: The GetPlayerName method retrieves the character name of the player
    currently logged into the game session. This method is commonly used in various
    game systems to identify players for communication, logging, or interaction purposes.
    The returned string represents the full character name as stored in the database
    and is valid only when a player is actively connected and authenticated through
    this session. The method does not perform any validation or authentication checks
    itself; it simply returns the cached player name from the session state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the player's character
    name. The string will be empty if no player is currently associated with the session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void HandlePlayerCommand(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    const std::string&\
      \ playerName = session->GetPlayerName();\n    if (!playerName.empty())\n   \
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Current player: %s\", playerName.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Chat Message Processing
    code: "void ProcessChatMessage(WorldSession* session, const std::string& message)\n\
      {\n    const std::string& playerName = session->GetPlayerName();\n    if (!playerName.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING, \"[%s]: %s\", playerName.c_str(),\
      \ message.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the session remains
    active and the player object exists. This method should not be called from threads
    other than the one handling the session's game loop. The name is cached at login
    time and may not reflect any temporary name changes during gameplay unless explicitly
    updated by the system.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string reference as it points to internal session
    data. Calling this method on a session without an associated player will return
    an empty string, which should be checked before use. Avoid calling this method
    in performance-critical sections where frequent access might impact server responsiveness.
