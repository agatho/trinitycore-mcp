  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: OnRemoveMember
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::OnRemoveMember(Group * group, int guid, int
    method, int kicker, const char * reason)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a player is removed from a group, providing details about the
    removal event.
  description: The OnRemoveMember method is invoked by the TrinityCore playerbot system
    when a member is removed from a group. This callback allows scripts to react to
    group membership changes, such as tracking player exits or performing cleanup
    operations. The method provides information about who was removed, how they were
    removed (e.g., kicked or left), and optionally a reason for the removal. This
    event is part of the group management system and is typically used in bot AI logic
    to maintain group integrity and adapt behavior accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object from which the member was removed. This
      represents the group context for the removal event.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who was removed
      from the group.
  - name: method
    description: An integer indicating the method by which the player was removed.
      Common values include 0 for leaving, 1 for being kicked, and 2 for being invited
      and then leaving.
  - name: kicker
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated the removal (e.g., the kicker).
      This is 0 if the player left voluntarily or if no specific kicker exists.
  - name: reason
    description: Optional null-terminated string describing the reason for the removal.
      May be NULL if no reason was provided.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation of OnRemoveMember
    code: "void MyPlayerbotScript::OnRemoveMember(Group* group, int guid, int method,\
      \ int kicker, const char* reason)\n{\n    if (method == 1) // Player was kicked\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %d was kicked from the group.\"\
      , guid);\n    }\n    else if (method == 0) // Player left voluntarily\n    {\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %d left the group.\", guid);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore playerbot AI framework and should
    be implemented in custom PlayerbotScript classes. The parameters are consistent
    with standard World of Warcraft group management events, making it compatible
    with existing bot AI logic.
  warnings: Ensure that any modifications to group state or bot behavior based on
    this event do not cause race conditions or inconsistent states within the playerbot
    system. Be cautious when modifying group membership directly from this callback
    as it may lead to unexpected behavior.
