documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the trait configuration, resetting its modified
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a TraitConfig instance. This operation typically indicates that any previously
    marked modifications to the trait configuration have been acknowledged or committed,
    effectively clearing the 'dirty' flag that tracks whether the configuration has
    been altered since last synchronization. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this method is often used when saving or applying trait configurations
    to ensure that subsequent checks do not mistakenly identify the configuration
    as modified. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'TraitConfig config;

      // ... modify config ...

      config.ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the changes mask after applying modifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after saving or synchronizing trait configurations
    to prevent unnecessary reprocessing of unchanged data. It is part of the internal
    state management for tracking configuration changes.
