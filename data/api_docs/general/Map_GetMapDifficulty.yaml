documentation:
  brief: Returns the map difficulty entry for the current map.
  description: This method retrieves the MapDifficultyEntry structure that defines
    the difficulty settings for the current map. It provides access to map-specific
    difficulty information including dungeon and raid difficulties, which is essential
    for determining player eligibility and game mechanics such as instance lockout
    and loot distribution. The returned entry contains metadata about the map's difficulty
    levels, including the number of players allowed in each difficulty mode and the
    associated level requirements for entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the MapDifficultyEntry structure which contains the
    difficulty settings for this map. Returns nullptr if no difficulty entry is found
    or if the map has not been initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry const* diffEntry = map->GetMapDifficulty();\nif (diffEntry)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Map difficulty ID: \" << diffEntry->ID << std::endl;\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Max players: \" << diffEntry->maxPlayers << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to determine player eligibility for instances. This function should be called
    only after the map has been properly initialized and loaded, otherwise it may
    return nullptr. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as it simply returns
    a pointer to an existing data structure.
  warnings: This method should not be used in contexts where the map might not be
    fully initialized yet, as it could lead to accessing invalid memory or returning
    nullptr. Also, be aware that the returned pointer may become invalid if the map's
    difficulty settings are modified during runtime.
