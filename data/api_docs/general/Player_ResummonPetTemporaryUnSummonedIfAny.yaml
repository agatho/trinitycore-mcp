documentation:
  brief: Resumes a temporarily unsummoned pet if one exists
  description: This method attempts to resummon a pet that was previously temporary
    unsummoned, typically when the player's pet is not currently active. The method
    checks if there is a temporary unsummoned pet in the player's pet list and restores
    it to the game world. It is commonly used during player actions such as switching
    between different forms or when certain abilities are activated. This method does
    not return any value but may trigger visual effects or gameplay changes related
    to pet summoning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'void player->ResummonPetTemporaryUnSummonedIfAny();

      // This method is typically called after a player performs an action that requires
      pet restoration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may cause unexpected behavior
    if the player's pet was not temporarily unsummoned. The implementation involves
    checking for existing pet entries and restoring them to their original state.
  warnings: This method may not work correctly if there is no temporary unsummoned
    pet in the player's list, potentially leading to undefined behavior or errors.
