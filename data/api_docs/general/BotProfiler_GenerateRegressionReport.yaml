  class: BotProfiler
  method: GenerateRegressionReport
  signature: void BotProfiler::GenerateRegressionReport(const int & sessionIds, std::string
    & report)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a regression report for bot performance metrics across specified
    sessions.
  description: The GenerateRegressionReport method creates a detailed performance
    analysis report for bot activities within the specified session IDs. This function
    aggregates various performance indicators such as response times, action execution
    rates, and resource utilization to provide insights into bot behavior over time.
    The generated report is formatted as a string and can be used for debugging, optimization,
    or performance monitoring purposes. The method operates on historical data collected
    during bot sessions and requires valid session identifiers to produce meaningful
    results.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionIds
    description: Reference to an integer representing the session identifier(s) for
      which the regression report should be generated. This parameter typically corresponds
      to a unique ID assigned to each bot session in the system.
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated regression report will
      be stored. The output format is typically structured text containing performance
      metrics and statistical analysis.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int sessionId = 12345;

      std::string report;

      botProfiler.GenerateRegressionReport(sessionId, report);

      // Report now contains performance data for session ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Session IDs Processing
    code: "std::vector<int> sessionIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int id : sessionIds)\
      \ {\n    std::string report;\n    botProfiler.GenerateRegressionReport(id, report);\n\
      \    // Process or log the generated report\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when processing large numbers
    of sessions. It's recommended to run this function asynchronously or during off-peak
    hours to avoid impacting live bot operations. The report generation process involves
    reading from persistent storage and performing statistical computations, which
    could be resource-intensive.
  warnings: Ensure that the session IDs provided are valid and correspond to existing
    bot sessions; otherwise, the method may produce empty or invalid reports. This
    function should not be called concurrently with other methods modifying session
    data to prevent race conditions.
