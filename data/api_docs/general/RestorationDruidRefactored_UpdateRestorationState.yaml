documentation:
  brief: Updates the restoration state of the Druid, managing mana regeneration and
    spell casting behavior.
  description: The UpdateRestorationState method is responsible for maintaining and
    updating the internal state of a Restoration Druid character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes managing mana regeneration rates, handling spell cooldowns,
    and ensuring proper resource allocation for healing spells. The method typically
    runs during each update cycle to keep the druid's restoration abilities synchronized
    with game mechanics such as form changes, talent point allocations, and buff/debuff
    effects. It ensures that the druid's healing capabilities are accurately reflected
    in the game state based on current conditions and player actions.

  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: "void MyDruidAI::Update()\n{\n    restorationDruid.UpdateRestorationState();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic. The implementation
    may involve checking for form transitions, updating spell queues, and recalculating
    mana regeneration rates based on current druid state.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of the intended update cycle as it may
    cause inconsistent state management or performance issues. The method assumes
    valid druid state and does not perform extensive error checking.
