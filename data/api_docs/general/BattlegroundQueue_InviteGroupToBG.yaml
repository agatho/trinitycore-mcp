    * bg, int side)
documentation:
  brief: Invites a group to join a battleground queue.
  description: The InviteGroupToBG method is responsible for inviting a group of players
    to participate in a specific battleground queue. It takes a GroupQueueInfo object
    that contains information about the group and the battleground they are being
    invited to, along with the side (alliance or horde) they will be playing on. This
    method ensures that all members of the group are properly queued for the battleground
    and handles the necessary synchronization between the group and the battleground
    system. The method returns true if the invitation was successfully processed,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: ginfo
    description: Pointer to a GroupQueueInfo structure containing information about
      the group being invited to the battleground queue.
  - name: bg
    description: Pointer to the Battleground object that the group is being invited
      to join.
  - name: side
    description: Integer value representing the side (alliance or horde) that the
      group will be playing on. Typically 0 for alliance, 1 for horde.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully invited to the battleground
    queue; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of InviteGroupToBG
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(123);

      GroupQueueInfo ginfo;

      ginfo.group = player->GetGroup();

      ginfo.bgTypeId = BATTLEGROUND_AV;

      bool result = bgQueue.InviteGroupToBG(&ginfo, bg, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground queue processing when
    a group is ready to be matched with a specific battleground. The method ensures
    that all players in the group are properly informed and queued for the battleground.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupQueueInfo structure is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized data can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes.
