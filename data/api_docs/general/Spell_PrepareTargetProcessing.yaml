  signature: void Spell::PrepareTargetProcessing()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal target processing state for spell execution.
  description: The PrepareTargetProcessing method initializes the internal target
    handling mechanism for a spell, setting up necessary data structures and flags
    required for target validation and processing during spell casting. This method
    is typically called internally by the spell system before executing the main spell
    logic. It prepares the spell's target list and ensures that all relevant targets
    are properly registered for damage calculation, effect application, or other spell-related
    operations. The method does not perform any actual targeting or validation but
    rather sets up the infrastructure needed for subsequent target processing steps.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell execution flow
    code: "void MySpell::Cast()\n{\n    // ... pre-cast logic ...\n    PrepareTargetProcessing();\n\
      \    // ... continue with target processing and effects ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell execution pipeline and should typically
    not be called directly by custom spell handlers. It's usually invoked automatically
    during spell initialization. The method may reset internal counters or iterators
    used for target processing, so calling it multiple times without proper cleanup
    could lead to unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand the internal spell
    execution flow. Incorrect usage can lead to corrupted target lists or undefined
    behavior during spell execution. This method should only be called when the spell
    is in a valid state for target processing.
