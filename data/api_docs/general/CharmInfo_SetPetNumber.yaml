documentation:
  brief: Sets the unique identifier number for a charmed pet within the CharmInfo
    system
  description: The SetPetNumber method assigns a unique numerical identifier to a
    charmed pet, which is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage pet instances.
    This method is typically invoked when a creature becomes charmed or when a pet's
    identification needs to be updated. The pet number is crucial for maintaining
    the relationship between the player and their summoned or charmed creature within
    the game's object management system. It ensures that the pet can be properly referenced
    and managed throughout its existence in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: petnumber
    description: The unique numerical identifier to assign to the charmed pet. This
      value is typically generated by the server and should be a positive integer
      representing the pet's instance ID within the game world.
  - name: statwindow
    description: A boolean flag that determines whether the pet's statistics window
      should be updated or refreshed after setting the new pet number. When true,
      the client will update the pet's stat display; when false, no UI refresh occurs.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the CharmInfo class which handles all aspects of pet
    management for charmed creatures. The pet number should be unique within the context
    of the player's active pets to prevent conflicts in object tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in duplicate
    pet numbers or invalid references. Ensure that the pet number being set is valid
    and unique before calling this method.
