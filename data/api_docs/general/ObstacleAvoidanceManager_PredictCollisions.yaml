documentation:
  brief: Predicts potential collisions for the current movement context using obstacle
    avoidance logic
  description: The PredictCollisions method analyzes the current detection context
    to determine possible collision scenarios with environmental obstacles. It evaluates
    the agent's movement path against static and dynamic obstacles within the defined
    detection range. The method returns a collision count or error code, indicating
    how many potential collisions were identified. This functionality is crucial for
    AI-driven navigation systems in TrinityCore, particularly for creatures and NPCs
    that need to avoid walls, furniture, or other entities while moving through the
    game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of predicted collisions found.
    A value of 0 indicates no collisions detected, while positive values indicate
    the count of potential collision points. Negative values may indicate error conditions
    such as invalid context data or internal processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Prediction
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager avoidanceManager;\nDetectionContext context;\n\
      // Populate context with current position, orientation, and movement data\n\
      int collisionCount = avoidanceManager.PredictCollisions(context);\nif (collisionCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Handle potential collision avoidance\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\"\
      , \"Detected {} potential collisions\", collisionCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to provide real-time
    obstacle detection feedback. The accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the
    quality and completeness of the DetectionContext provided. Performance can be
    impacted by complex environments with many obstacles, so it's recommended to call
    this method at appropriate intervals rather than every frame.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input context data; passing an uninitialized
    or corrupted DetectionContext may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    The return value should always be checked for negative values which indicate error
    conditions requiring proper handling.
