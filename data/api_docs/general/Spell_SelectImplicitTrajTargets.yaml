    const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit trajectory targets for spell effects based on target type
    and spell effect information.
  description: This method determines and selects appropriate trajectory targets for
    spell effects by analyzing the provided spell effect information and target type.
    It handles the selection of targets for spells that require trajectory calculations,
    such as those involving area-of-effect or projectile-based mechanics. The method
    ensures proper target selection based on game rules and spell parameters, particularly
    for spells with multiple effects or complex targeting requirements. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining accurate spell execution and ensuring proper targeting
    in World of Warcraft combat systems.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains detailed information about the specific spell effect being
      processed, including effect type, target, and other relevant parameters that
      influence trajectory selection.
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type for the spell effect, which determines
      how targets are selected and calculated for trajectory-based spells. This includes
      various target types such as area of effect, single target, or multiple targets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitTrajTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType);

      // This method processes the spell effect information and target type to determine
      trajectory targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitTrajTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType);

      // For complex spells with multiple effects, this method ensures proper target
      selection for each effect

      // This is particularly important for spells like Arcane Explosion or Frost
      Nova where trajectory targets must be calculated correctly'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell processing and target selection
    phases. It requires careful handling of spell effect information and target type
    parameters to ensure correct trajectory calculations. The implementation may involve
    complex logic for determining target positions, especially for spells with multiple
    effects or area-of-effect mechanics.
  warnings: Improper handling of spellEffectInfo or targetType parameters can lead
    to incorrect target selection, potentially causing spells to miss their targets
    or select invalid targets. This method should be used carefully in conjunction
    with other spell processing methods to ensure proper spell execution.
