documentation:
  brief: Moves an InstanceLock object, transferring its locked state and resources
    to the target instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of an InstanceLock
    object. It transfers the ownership of any held locks or resources from the source
    InstanceLock to the current instance, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified
    state. This is typically used when reassigning lock ownership or moving lock objects
    between different scopes. In the context of TrinityCore's instance management
    system, this operation ensures that instance locks are properly transferred without
    unnecessary duplication or resource contention. The method adheres to standard
    move semantics and is commonly used in scenarios involving smart pointers, containers,
    or temporary object management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current InstanceLock object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InstanceLock lock1;

      // ... acquire some locks ...

      InstanceLock lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Move lock1''s state to lock2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Container
    code: 'std::vector<InstanceLock> locks;

      locks.emplace_back();

      locks.push_back(std::move(locks.front())); // Move the first element'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard C++ move semantics. After a successful move,
    the source object should not be used in a meaningful way unless it's reassigned.
    The implementation assumes that the moved-from object is left in a valid state,
    though its contents are unspecified.
  warnings: Using the moved-from InstanceLock after calling operator= can lead to
    undefined behavior or resource corruption. Always ensure that no further operations
    are performed on the source object after a move assignment.
