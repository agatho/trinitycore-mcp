  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: StartMovement
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::StartMovement(Player * bot, const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates movement of a bot player towards a specified destination coordinate.
  description: The StartMovement method begins the process of moving a bot player
    to a given destination coordinate. It is typically used within AI behavior systems
    where bots need to navigate to specific locations. The method handles pathfinding
    and movement initiation, returning true if the movement was successfully started
    or false if it failed due to invalid parameters or movement constraints. This
    method integrates with TrinityCore's movement system and requires the destination
    to be valid for the current map context.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will begin
      moving. Must not be null.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to an integer representing the destination coordinate or
      identifier. The exact meaning depends on implementation but typically corresponds
      to a waypoint, position, or target location index.
  returns: Returns true if movement was successfully initiated for the bot player,
    false otherwise. Movement may fail if the destination is invalid, the bot is already
    moving, or movement constraints prevent execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot\nint dest = 100;\nif (leaderFollowBehavior.StartMovement(bot,\
      \ dest)) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ start movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint destination = 250;\nbool success = leaderFollowBehavior.StartMovement(bot,\
      \ destination);\nif (!success) {\n    // Log error or handle failure case\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to start movement for bot %u to destination %d\"\
      , bot->GetGUID().GetCounter(), destination);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player is already initialized and valid
    within the TrinityCore world. The destination parameter should correspond to a
    valid location in the current map context. Movement behavior may be affected by
    terrain, obstacles, or AI configuration settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. The destination value must be meaningful for the current
    map and world state; otherwise, movement will likely fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior.
