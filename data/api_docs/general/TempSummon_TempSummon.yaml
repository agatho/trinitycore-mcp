  class: TempSummon
  method: TempSummon
  signature: void TempSummon::TempSummon(const SummonPropertiesEntry * properties,
    int * owner, bool isWorldObject)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a temporary summon with specified properties and owner reference.
  description: The TempSummon constructor initializes a temporary summon object with
    provided summon properties, an optional owner reference, and a flag indicating
    whether the summon is a world object. This method sets up internal state for the
    summoned creature, including its summon type, duration, and relationship to the
    summoner. The summon will typically be removed from the game world after a specified
    time or when the owner dies, depending on the properties provided.
  parameters:
  - name: properties
    description: Pointer to SummonPropertiesEntry containing summon behavior and duration
      settings. Must not be null for valid initialization.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner's identifier (e.g.,
      GUID). Can be null if no owner is specified.
  - name: isWorldObject
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this summon should be treated as
      a world object. True means it persists in the world, false may indicate temporary
      or ephemeral behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TempSummon Initialization
    code: 'const SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sObjectMgr->GetSummonProperties(1);

      int ownerGuid = 12345;

      TempSummon* summon = new TempSummon(props, &ownerGuid, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Null Owner
    code: 'const SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sObjectMgr->GetSummonProperties(2);

      TempSummon* summon = new TempSummon(props, nullptr, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating summoned creatures. Developers should ensure that SummonPropertiesEntry
    is valid and properly loaded before passing it to this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null properties pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure all summon properties are correctly configured before initialization.
