documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's item level based on area scaling factors.
  description: The UpdateItemLevelAreaBasedScaling method adjusts a player's effective
    item level according to the current zone's scaling rules. This method is typically
    invoked when a player enters a new area or when area-based scaling parameters
    change. It ensures that players receive appropriate item level adjustments for
    the content they are engaging with, maintaining balance between different zones
    and difficulty levels. The adjustment considers factors such as the player's current
    level, the zone's scaling factor, and any applicable modifiers.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateItemLevelAreaBasedScaling();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called during zone transitions and should not
    typically be invoked manually unless implementing custom area scaling behavior.
    The calculation involves checking the current zone's scaling parameters against
    the player's level to determine appropriate item level adjustments.
