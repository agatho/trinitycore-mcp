  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteConservativeStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a conservative bidding strategy for auction house auctions based
    on player input and session data.
  description: The ExecuteConservativeStrategy method implements a risk-averse approach
    to bidding in the auction house system. It analyzes the current auction environment,
    evaluates player preferences, and determines optimal bid amounts using predefined
    conservative thresholds. This method is typically invoked during automated auction
    house operations where strategic bidding behavior is required. The function takes
    a pointer to a player identifier and references an auction session to make informed
    decisions about bid placement and auction participation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who will be executing the conservative bidding strategy. This value should
      point to a valid player ID within the game world.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object containing current auction
      session data, including active auctions, bid history, and session-specific parameters
      that influence strategic decision-making.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of Conservative Strategy
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteConservativeStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Conservative Strategy with Dynamic Player Data
    code: 'int* playerId = new int(54321);

      AuctionSession session;

      // Populate session with current auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteConservativeStrategy(playerId, session);

      delete playerId;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AuctionSession object has been properly initialized
    with relevant auction data before execution. The conservative strategy typically
    results in lower-risk bidding behavior compared to aggressive strategies, focusing
    on maintaining player resources while still achieving competitive outcomes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    within the game world, as invalid references may cause undefined behavior. This
    method modifies session data internally, so concurrent access to the session object
    should be avoided during execution.
