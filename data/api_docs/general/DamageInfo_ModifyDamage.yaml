  class: DamageInfo
  method: ModifyDamage
  signature: void DamageInfo::ModifyDamage(int32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the damage value of the DamageInfo object by adding the specified
    amount.
  description: The ModifyDamage method adjusts the current damage value stored within
    a DamageInfo instance by adding the provided integer amount. This method is typically
    used during combat calculations to apply modifiers such as buffs, debuffs, critical
    hits, or armor reduction. The modification is applied directly to the internal
    damage value and does not return a new value. It's important to note that this
    method may be called multiple times on the same DamageInfo object, with each call
    accumulating the damage adjustment. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input amount, so negative values will reduce the damage while positive
    values will increase it.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The integer value to add to the current damage. Can be positive (increase
      damage) or negative (decrease damage).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Modification
    code: 'DamageInfo damageInfo;

      // Assume initial damage is set to 100

      int32 modifier = 25;

      damageInfo.ModifyDamage(modifier); // Damage is now 125'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying a Damage Reduction
    code: 'DamageInfo damageInfo;

      // Assume initial damage is set to 150

      int32 reduction = -30;

      damageInfo.ModifyDamage(reduction); // Damage is now 120'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the DamageInfo object directly.
    It's commonly used in combat systems where damage calculations are adjusted based
    on various factors like spell effects, weapon enchantments, or player status conditions.
    The method assumes that the DamageInfo object has already been initialized with
    a valid base damage value before calling this function.
  warnings: Be cautious when applying large negative values as they may result in
    negative damage which could have unintended consequences in game mechanics. Also,
    ensure that this method is not called on an uninitialized DamageInfo object to
    avoid undefined behavior.
