  class: GameEventMgr
  method: UpdateWorldStates
  signature: void GameEventMgr::UpdateWorldStates(uint16 event_id, bool Activate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates world states for a specified game event, either activating or deactivating
    them.
  description: The UpdateWorldStates method manages the activation and deactivation
    of world states associated with a specific game event. It is typically invoked
    when a game event begins or ends to ensure that the appropriate world states are
    set or cleared. This functionality is crucial for dynamic in-game events such
    as holidays, seasonal changes, or special promotions where certain visual or gameplay
    elements need to be toggled on or off. The method operates based on the provided
    event ID and activation state, modifying the game's world state accordingly. It
    does not directly interact with player data but rather affects global world state
    variables that may influence client-side rendering and server-side logic.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event whose world states need to
      be updated. This ID corresponds to entries in the game_event table.
  - name: Activate
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the world states associated with the specified event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate World States for Event ID 1234
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateWorldStates(1234, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate World States for Event ID 5678
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateWorldStates(5678, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that track world
    states and their associations with game events. It is typically called during
    event start/end logic and may be part of a larger system managing dynamic in-game
    content. The method assumes valid event IDs and does not perform validation checks
    on the input parameters.
