  signature: Map * MapManager::FindMap_i(uint32 mapId, uint32 instanceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a pointer to a Map object for the specified map and instance identifiers.
  description: The FindMap_i method is used to locate and return a pointer to an existing
    Map object within the TrinityCore server's map management system. It takes a map
    identifier and an instance identifier as parameters, and returns a pointer to
    the corresponding Map object if it exists in memory. If no such map instance is
    currently loaded, the method will return a null pointer. This method is essential
    for accessing world data, handling player movement, and managing instance-specific
    content within the game world. The method operates on the assumption that valid
    map and instance IDs have been provided, and it's typically used internally by
    the core systems to manage world state and player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier for the base map (e.g., 0 for Eastern Kingdoms,
      1 for Kalimdor). Must be a valid map ID registered in the game's database.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance identifier for the specific instance of the map. A value
      of 0 indicates the default world map instance, while non-zero values represent
      unique instances (e.g., raid instances).
  returns: A pointer to a Map object if a matching map instance exists in memory;
    otherwise, returns nullptr if no such map is currently loaded or if invalid parameters
    are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve a world map
    code: "Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap_i(0, 0); // Retrieves the main Eastern Kingdoms\
      \ map\nif (map)\n{\n    // Proceed with operations on the map\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieving a specific raid instance
    code: "uint32 instanceId = 12345;\nMap* raidMap = sMapMgr->FindMap_i(720, instanceId);\
      \ // Finds the instance of The Eye map\nif (raidMap)\n{\n    // Handle raid-specific\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the code
    where quick access to loaded maps is required. It does not load maps automatically;
    it only returns pointers to already-loaded instances. The returned Map pointer
    should be used carefully as it may become invalid if the map instance is unloaded.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without checking for null returns,
    as attempting to dereference a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, ensure that
    the provided mapId and instanceId are valid before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior or errors.
