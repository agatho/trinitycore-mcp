  class: LootStrategy
  method: LootCorpse
  signature: bool LootStrategy::LootCorpse(BotAI * ai, int corpseGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates loot collection from a specified corpse using the bot's AI.
  description: The LootCorpse method is responsible for triggering the process of
    looting items from a dead creature or player corpse within the game world. It
    utilizes the provided BotAI instance to determine what items should be looted
    based on the bot's configured loot strategy and priority settings. The method
    takes a corpse GUID as input to identify which specific corpse to loot, ensuring
    that only the intended target is processed. This function typically integrates
    with the broader loot management system of the TrinityCore-based bot framework,
    coordinating with inventory handling and loot distribution logic.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot's behavior and
      decision-making during loot operations.
  - name: corpseGuid
    description: Integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the corpse from
      which items will be looted. Must correspond to a valid, existing corpse in the
      game world.
  returns: Returns true if the loot operation was successfully initiated or completed
    for the specified corpse; otherwise returns false if the operation failed due
    to invalid input, missing corpse, or other error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Corpse Usage
    code: "if (strategy->LootCorpse(ai, 12345)) {\n    // Loot process started successfully\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"ai.bot\", \"Successfully initiated loot for corpse ID: 12345\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate loot\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai.bot\", \"Failed\
      \ to loot corpse ID: 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot Corpse with Error Handling
    code: "int corpseId = GetNearbyCorpseGuid();\nif (corpseId > 0) {\n    if (!strategy->LootCorpse(ai,\
      \ corpseId)) {\n        LOG_WARN(\"ai.bot\", \"Could not loot corpse ID: {}\"\
      , corpseId);\n        // Handle failure case\n    }\n} else {\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      ai.bot\", \"No nearby corpses to loot\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI instance has proper access to the game world
    state and that the corpse GUID corresponds to an actual, valid corpse. The implementation
    may involve interaction with the game's packet system and server-side loot logic,
    potentially causing delays depending on network conditions or server load.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided corpseGuid is valid before calling this method;
    otherwise, it could lead to undefined behavior or errors in the bot's AI processing.
    Also, be aware that frequent calls to this function without proper cooldowns might
    cause performance issues or trigger anti-cheat systems.
