  class: WarriorAI
  method: HandleDefensiveSituation
  signature: void WarriorAI::HandleDefensiveSituation()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the warrior's current defensive state and applies appropriate defensive
    actions.
  description: The HandleDefensiveSituation method is responsible for assessing the
    warrior AI's current combat scenario and determining the most suitable defensive
    measures to take. This includes evaluating threat levels, health status, and proximity
    to enemies to decide whether to activate defensive abilities such as Shield Block,
    Defensive Stance, or other protective mechanisms. The method integrates with the
    overall AI decision-making process to ensure that the warrior prioritizes survival
    when under attack or in high-risk situations. It typically runs during each AI
    update cycle to dynamically adjust defensive behavior based on real-time combat
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandleDefensiveSituation();\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the WarriorAI's main update loop
    and should not be invoked directly from other threads without proper synchronization.
    The defensive actions taken are dependent on the warrior's current health percentage,
    threat level, and available defensive abilities.
  warnings: Care must be taken when overriding this method in custom AI implementations,
    as improper handling can lead to unexpected behavior during combat. Ensure that
    any defensive actions respect cooldowns and resource requirements of the warrior
    class.
