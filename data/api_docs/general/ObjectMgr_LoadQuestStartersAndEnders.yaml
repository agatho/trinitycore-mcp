documentation:
  brief: Loads quest starter and ender data from database tables into memory for fast
    lookup.
  description: The LoadQuestStartersAndEnders method initializes internal data structures
    by loading quest-related NPC and GameObject entries that start or end quests.
    It populates maps used to quickly determine which NPCs or GameObjects can initiate
    or complete specific quests, enabling efficient quest system operations during
    gameplay. This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    processes to ensure all quest relationships are properly indexed in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadQuestStartersAndEnders();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. It performs no locking
    internally, so it must be called from a single-threaded context during server
    startup or reload operations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal lookup tables. Do not invoke this
    method while active gameplay is occurring as it may cause race conditions.
