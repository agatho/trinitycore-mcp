  class: Unit
  method: GetPowerType
  signature: int Unit::GetPowerType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the power type of the unit, which determines the resource used for
    mana, rage, focus, or energy.
  description: The GetPowerType method retrieves the power type associated with a
    Unit object, indicating what kind of resource the unit uses for abilities and
    actions. This is essential for understanding how the unit manages its resources
    in combat, as different power types (mana, rage, focus, energy) have distinct
    behaviors and usage patterns. The method returns an integer representing one of
    several predefined power types, such as mana (0), rage (1), focus (2), or energy
    (3). This information is crucial for determining how the unit interacts with various
    game mechanics like spell casting, ability usage, and resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the power type of the unit. Possible values
    include: 0 (mana), 1 (rage), 2 (focus), 3 (energy). The method does not return
    null or error values; it always returns a valid power type value.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int powerType = unit->GetPowerType();\nif (powerType == POWER_MANA)\n{\n\
      \    // Unit uses mana\n}\nelse if (powerType == POWER_RAGE)\n{\n    // Unit\
      \ uses rage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other power-related functions
    like GetPower, GetMaxPower, and GetPowerType for comprehensive resource management.
    Performance-wise, this method is lightweight and does not involve any complex
    computations or database calls.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing power type values directly; ensure you're using
    the correct constants (e.g., POWER_MANA vs. 0) to avoid logic errors in your code.
