  class: PathCache
  method: PathCache
  signature: void PathCache::PathCache(int * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the path cache for the specified map.
  description: The PathCache constructor initializes internal data structures used
    for pathfinding calculations on the specified map. This method sets up necessary
    caching mechanisms to improve performance when calculating paths between points.
    The initialization process typically involves allocating memory, setting up lookup
    tables, and preparing the cache for subsequent path queries. It is important that
    this method is called before any pathfinding operations are performed on the given
    map.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the map identifier. This value
      determines which map's path cache will be initialized and used for pathfinding
      operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Path Cache for Map 0
    code: 'int mapId = 0;

      PathCache cache;

      cache.PathCache(&mapId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per map during initialization. Repeated
    calls may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The map parameter must point
    to a valid map identifier that exists in the game world.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized map pointer can result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the map identifier points to a valid map before
    calling this method.
