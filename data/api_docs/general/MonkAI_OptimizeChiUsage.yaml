  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeChiUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes chi usage for the monk AI by determining the most effective chi-based
    abilities to cast based on current resource levels and combat state.
  description: The OptimizeChiUsage method is responsible for calculating and selecting
    the optimal chi-based abilities for a monk AI character. It evaluates the current
    chi resource level, available abilities, and combat context to determine which
    chi-consuming spells or abilities will provide the greatest benefit in terms of
    damage output, survivability, or resource efficiency. This method typically runs
    during the AI's decision-making cycle and influences the monk's tactical behavior
    in both PvE and PvP scenarios. The optimization considers factors such as chi
    cost, cooldown status, target health, and the monk's current stance or form to
    make intelligent decisions about when and how to spend chi.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeChiUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with chi-based ability execution
    code: "void MonkAI::OptimizeChiUsage()\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Determine optimal chi usage\n    uint8 bestAbility\
      \ = SelectBestChiAbility();\n    \n    if (bestAbility != 0)\n    {\n      \
      \  DoCast(bestAbility);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked before any chi-based ability execution. The optimization logic may vary
    depending on the monk's specialization (Mistweaver, Windwalker, or Brewmaster)
    and current encounter state. The implementation might also consider environmental
    factors such as proximity to allies or enemies.
  warnings: This method assumes that the AI has access to up-to-date information about
    chi resources and available abilities. Calling this method without proper setup
    may result in incorrect ability selection or resource waste. Ensure that the monk's
    current chi level and ability cooldowns are properly synchronized before invoking
    this optimization routine.
