  class: GroupFormation
  method: GetFormationType
  signature: FormationType GroupFormation::GetFormationType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation type assigned to a group formation.
  description: The GetFormationType method returns the FormationType enum value that
    defines how units in the group are positioned or organized. This is typically
    used in AI behavior systems where group formations affect movement patterns, positioning
    during combat, and tactical behavior. The returned value indicates whether the
    group is using a specific formation such as line, circle, wedge, or other predefined
    configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationType enum value representing the current formation type of the
    group. Possible values include LINE, CIRCLE, WEDGE, GRID, and others depending
    on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nFormationType\
      \ type = formation->GetFormationType();\nif (type == FORMATION_LINE)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle line formation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group AI processing to determine how
    units should be positioned. The FormationType enum values may vary based on game
    version and custom modifications.
