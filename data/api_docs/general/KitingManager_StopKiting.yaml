  brief: Stops the kiting behavior of a player, disabling movement-based combat mechanics.
  description: The StopKiting method terminates any active kiting behavior for the
    player, which typically involves stopping movement-based combat strategies such
    as maintaining distance from enemies while attacking. This method ensures that
    the player's movement and attack patterns return to normal state, disabling any
    kiting-specific logic or adjustments. It is commonly used when transitioning out
    of combat situations or when a player manually stops kiting. The method does not
    take any parameters and has no return value.

    code: 'KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();

      kitingMgr->StopKiting();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when the player is no longer engaged in kiting
    behavior to ensure proper state management. It may also reset internal timers
    or flags related to kiting mechanics.
