documentation:
  brief: Loads player equipment sets from database
  description: This method loads the player's equipment sets from the database, which
    are used to store and retrieve character equipment configurations. It handles
    the loading process for all equipment sets associated with the player, including
    the main hand, off hand, and two-handed weapons. The method ensures that the player's
    equipment set data is properly initialized and ready for use during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadEquipmentSets(0);

      // This loads the equipment sets for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during player initialization and requires
    database access. It may be invoked multiple times depending on the game state,
    and should be thread-safe when used in multiplayer environments.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless explicitly
    required. The method handles database loading internally and should only be triggered
    by internal game mechanics.
