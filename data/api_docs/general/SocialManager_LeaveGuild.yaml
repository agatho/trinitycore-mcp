  class: SocialManager
  method: LeaveGuild
  signature: bool SocialManager::LeaveGuild()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the player from their current guild.
  description: The LeaveGuild method removes the calling player from their currently
    associated guild. This action results in the player losing all guild-specific
    privileges, benefits, and membership status. The method performs necessary cleanup
    operations such as updating the player's guild ID, removing guild permissions,
    and notifying other guild members of the player's departure. It also handles the
    removal of any guild-related data such as achievements, titles, or rewards that
    were tied to the guild membership.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the guild, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the player was not
    in a guild or that an error occurred during the removal process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (socialManager.LeaveGuild()) {\n    // Player successfully left the\
      \ guild\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have left the guild.\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Failed to leave the guild\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Failed to leave the\
      \ guild.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is actually a member of
    a guild. The implementation internally checks if the player has a valid guild
    association before proceeding with removal operations.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player who is not in a guild may result in undefined
    behavior or error conditions. Additionally, players cannot leave their guild if
    they are the guild leader; they must transfer leadership first.
