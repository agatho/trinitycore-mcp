  class: TankPositionStrategy
  method: TankPositionStrategy
  signature: void TankPositionStrategy::TankPositionStrategy(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new TankPositionStrategy instance with the specified map context.
  description: The TankPositionStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of
    the TankPositionStrategy class, setting up internal state based on the provided
    Map object. This strategy is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine
    optimal positioning for tank units within a specific game map. The constructor
    prepares the strategy with necessary map data and context required for position
    calculations and pathfinding operations. It ensures that all internal references
    to the map are properly established before the strategy can be effectively utilized
    by AI controllers.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object that defines the game environment where
      tank positioning will be calculated. This parameter is required and must point
      to a valid Map instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TankPositionStrategy Initialization
    code: 'Map* myMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      TankPositionStrategy strategy(myMap);

      // Strategy is now initialized with map context'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using TankPositionStrategy in AI Context
    code: "class MyAIController : public UnitAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\n\
      \    {\n        Map* currentMap = GetUnit()->GetMap();\n        tankStrategy\
      \ = new TankPositionStrategy(currentMap);\n    }\n    \nprivate:\n    TankPositionStrategy*\
      \ tankStrategy;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor does not perform any expensive operations or heavy initialization.
    It primarily sets up internal references to the map object. The actual positioning
    calculations are typically deferred until specific methods like GetPosition()
    or Evaluate() are called. This class is part of the TrinityCore AI system and
    should be used within the context of proper AI framework integration.
  warnings: Ensure that the Map pointer passed to the constructor is valid and not
    null. Using an invalid map reference may lead to undefined behavior during position
    calculations. This constructor should only be called when the map is fully initialized
    and ready for AI operations.
