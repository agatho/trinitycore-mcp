  method: BaseBGStrategy
  signature: void BaseBGStrategy::BaseBGStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BaseBGStrategy class with default settings
    and configurations.
  description: The BaseBGStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the BaseBGStrategy
    class, which serves as a foundational strategy class for battleground AI behaviors
    in TrinityCore. This method sets up internal data structures and default parameters
    required for battleground strategy execution. It typically configures basic behavior
    flags, initializes member variables to their default states, and prepares the
    object for use within the game's battleground system. The constructor ensures
    that all necessary components are properly initialized before the strategy can
    be applied to any battleground scenario.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BaseBGStrategy instance
    code: 'BaseBGStrategy* strategy = new BaseBGStrategy();

      // The strategy object is now initialized and ready for use in battleground
      AI

      strategy->Initialize(); // Typically called afterward to set up specific behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by game code, but rather
    through derived class constructors or factory methods. The actual initialization
    of battleground strategies often involves additional setup steps beyond the basic
    constructor. Developers should be aware that this is a base class and most functionality
    will be implemented in derived classes.
  warnings: Do not instantiate BaseBGStrategy directly for gameplay use; it's intended
    to be inherited by specific battleground strategy implementations. Calling methods
    on an uninitialized BaseBGStrategy instance may result in undefined behavior or
    crashes.
