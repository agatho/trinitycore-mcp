  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: IsBotInRange
  signature: bool InterruptCoordinatorFixed::IsBotInRange(int botGuid, int targetGuid,
    uint32 range) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is within a specified range of a target GUID.
  description: The IsBotInRange method determines whether a bot identified by its
    GUID is within a given range of a target GUID. This method is typically used in
    AI logic to assess proximity for spell casting, movement decisions, or combat
    behavior. It evaluates the spatial relationship between two entities in the game
    world and returns a boolean result indicating if the distance constraint is satisfied.
    The method operates on fixed-range thresholds and does not account for dynamic
    obstacles or line-of-sight conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot entity to check.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity to compare against.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which the bot must be located
      relative to the target.
  returns: True if the bot is within the specified range of the target, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check proximity
    code: "if (interruptCoordinator.IsBotInRange(botGuid, targetGuid, 30)) {\n   \
      \ // Bot is within 30 yards of the target\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making
    code: "if (interruptCoordinator.IsBotInRange(botGuid, targetGuid, 15)) {\n   \
      \ // Cast interrupt spell if bot is close enough\n    CastInterruptSpell();\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer to target\n    MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal positioning system of TrinityCore and
    assumes that both entities are valid and exist in the world. It performs a simple
    Euclidean distance check without considering terrain or object collisions. The
    range parameter is interpreted as a flat distance in yards.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid and targetGuid refer to valid entities before calling
    this method, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This function does not perform any validation on the range value, so extreme values
    might cause performance issues or unexpected outcomes.
