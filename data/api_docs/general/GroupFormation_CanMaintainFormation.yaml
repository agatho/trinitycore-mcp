  class: GroupFormation
  method: CanMaintainFormation
  signature: bool GroupFormation::CanMaintainFormation(const int & destination) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group can maintain its formation at the specified destination.
  description: The CanMaintainFormation method evaluates if a group is capable of
    maintaining its configured formation when moving towards a given destination.
    This method considers factors such as group member positions, movement constraints,
    and formation rules to determine if the current formation can be preserved. It's
    typically used during group movement operations to ensure that the group stays
    together in the desired formation pattern rather than dispersing or breaking apart.
  parameters:
  - name: destination
    description: The destination index or identifier representing where the group
      is attempting to move. This parameter likely corresponds to a specific location
      within the game world or a predefined waypoint in the group's movement path.
  returns: Returns true if the group can successfully maintain its formation at the
    specified destination, false otherwise. The method returns false when formation
    constraints cannot be satisfied due to environmental limitations, member positioning,
    or movement restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Formation Maintenance Before Moving
    code: "if (groupFormation->CanMaintainFormation(destinationIndex)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with group movement\n    group->SetDestination(destinationIndex);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle formation breakage\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Cannot maintain\
      \ formation at destination\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on group member distances, angles, and
    movement paths to ensure that the formation is preserved. It may be called frequently
    during group movement operations to dynamically adjust behavior based on changing
    conditions.
