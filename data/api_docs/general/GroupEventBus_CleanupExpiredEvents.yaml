  class: GroupEventBus
  method: CleanupExpiredEvents
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::CleanupExpiredEvents()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired events from the group event bus and returns the count of
    cleaned-up events.
  description: The CleanupExpiredEvents method iterates through all registered events
    in the GroupEventBus and removes those that have exceeded their valid lifetime.
    This method is typically called periodically by the game loop to maintain performance
    and prevent memory leaks caused by stale event data. It ensures that only active,
    relevant events remain in the system, improving overall efficiency of event handling
    within group-based gameplay mechanics such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of expired events that were
    successfully removed from the GroupEventBus. A return value of zero indicates
    no expired events were found during the cleanup process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateGroupEvents()\n{\n    GroupEventBus& eventBus = GroupEventBus::Instance();\n\
      \    uint32 cleanedCount = eventBus.CleanupExpiredEvents();\n    if (cleanedCount\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Cleaned up %u expired\
      \ events from group event bus.\", cleanedCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to prevent accumulation
    of stale events. It is designed to be thread-safe and can be safely invoked from
    different threads without external synchronization.
