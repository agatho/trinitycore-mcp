  class: TransportMgr
  method: AddPathNodeToTransport
  signature: void TransportMgr::AddPathNodeToTransport(int transportEntry, int timeSeg,
    const TransportAnimationEntry * node)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a transport animation node to a specified transport at a given time
    segment.
  description: The AddPathNodeToTransport method is used to register a transport animation
    node for a specific transport entry at a defined time segment. This method is
    typically invoked during the initialization or loading of transport systems within
    the TrinityCore server. It allows the server to define the path and movement behavior
    of transports such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving objects in the game world.
    The method takes a transport entry ID, a time segment identifier, and a pointer
    to a TransportAnimationEntry structure that defines the node's properties including
    position, orientation, and timing data. This functionality is crucial for proper
    transport behavior and synchronization with client-side animations.
  parameters:
  - name: transportEntry
    description: The unique database entry identifier for the transport object. This
      value corresponds to the ID field in the game's transport-related tables such
      as 'transport_template' or similar.
  - name: timeSeg
    description: The time segment index where this animation node should be applied.
      Time segments define discrete points along a transport's journey, typically
      used for interpolation between keyframes.
  - name: node
    description: A pointer to a TransportAnimationEntry structure containing the animation
      data for this node. This includes position coordinates, orientation data, and
      timing information that defines how the transport should behave at this specific
      point in time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Path Node to a Transport
    code: 'TransportAnimationEntry node;

      node.X = 100.0f;

      node.Y = 200.0f;

      node.Z = 50.0f;

      node.O = 1.57f; // 90 degrees in radians

      node.TimeSeg = 0;

      TransportMgr::AddPathNodeToTransport(12345, 0, &node);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when loading transport
    data from database files. The TransportAnimationEntry structure must be properly
    initialized before calling this method. Multiple nodes can be added per transport
    entry to define complex movement paths, and they should generally be added in
    chronological order by time segment.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid transportEntry values may result in undefined
    behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the TransportAnimationEntry pointer is
    valid and not null before passing it to this method. Adding nodes out of sequence
    might cause incorrect interpolation during transport movement.
