  signature: int FleeingMovementGenerator::GetMovementGeneratorType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for fleeing behavior.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the FleeingMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by the TrinityCore AI system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    and ensure proper handling of creature behaviors. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a predefined enum or constant that represents the fleeing movement
    type within the game's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for fleeing
    behavior. This value is typically a constant defined in the movement generator
    enumeration system, commonly used to identify this specific movement behavior
    in AI decision-making and state management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeingGen;

      int type = fleeingGen.GetMovementGeneratorType();

      // type will contain the identifier for fleeing movement generator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "void HandleAIUpdate(Unit* unit) {\n    if (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FLEEING_MOTION_TYPE) {\n        int type = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator()->GetMovementGeneratorType();\n\
      \        // Process fleeing behavior based on returned type\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI processing to determine the current
    movement behavior of a creature. The return value should be consistent across
    all instances of FleeingMovementGenerator and is used for internal type checking
    within the motion master system.
