  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleContestedEventAlliance
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleContestedEventAlliance(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the contested event for the Alliance faction when a control zone
    GameObject is interacted with.
  description: 'The HandleContestedEventAlliance method processes the logic associated
    with an Alliance player interacting with a contested control zone GameObject in
    World of Warcraft. This typically occurs during battlegrounds or zones where factions
    compete for territorial control. The method likely updates faction standings,
    triggers visual effects, and may award rewards or modify game state based on the
    interaction. It is part of the ControlZoneHandler class which manages all control
    zone related events for both factions. Precondition: A valid GameObject representing
    a control zone must be passed as parameter. Postcondition: The Alliance faction''s
    contested event state is updated accordingly.'
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: Pointer to the GameObject representing the contested control zone
      that was interacted with by an Alliance player. Must not be null and should
      represent a valid control zone object in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground
    code: "void MyBattleground::OnAlliancePlayerInteract(Player* player, GameObject*\
      \ controlZone)\n{\n    ControlZoneHandler handler;\n    handler.HandleContestedEventAlliance(controlZone);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger battleground or zone control system.
    The actual implementation details may depend on how the control zone GameObject
    is configured in the database and what events are registered for it. Consider
    that this method might be called from multiple threads depending on how the game
    handles player interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone parameter is properly validated before calling
    this method to prevent null pointer dereferences. This method should only be invoked
    when a legitimate Alliance player interaction with a contested zone occurs, otherwise
    unexpected behavior may result.
