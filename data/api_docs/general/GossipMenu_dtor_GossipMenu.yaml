  class: GossipMenu
  method: ~GossipMenu
  signature: void GossipMenu::~GossipMenu()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GossipMenu instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The GossipMenu destructor is automatically invoked when a GossipMenu
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of internal data structures, including removing references to menu items,
    options, and any associated player interactions. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, gossip menus are used to present interactive dialogue trees to players
    through NPCs, and this destructor guarantees that no memory leaks occur when these
    menus are no longer needed. The destruction process typically involves releasing
    allocated memory for menu entries and ensuring that any pending player interactions
    are properly terminated.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void HandleGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    GossipMenu\
      \ menu;\n    // Add menu items...\n    // When function ends, menu is automatically\
      \ destroyed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'GossipMenu* menu = new GossipMenu();

      // Configure menu...

      delete menu; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called and should not be invoked manually unless
    using dynamic allocation. It's important to understand that while the destructor
    handles cleanup, it does not directly interact with the player's UI state - this
    is managed by the core game loop and packet sending mechanisms.
