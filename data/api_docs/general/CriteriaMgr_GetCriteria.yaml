documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a criteria definition by its unique identifier from the criteria
    manager.
  description: The GetCriteria method fetches a const pointer to a Criteria object
    using the provided criteriaId. This method is typically used within the World
    of Warcraft TrinityCore framework to access predefined achievement or quest criteria
    definitions. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that maps
    criteria IDs to their corresponding criteria objects. It is important to note
    that the returned pointer is const, meaning the criteria data should not be modified
    through this interface. The method assumes that the criteriaId passed in corresponds
    to a valid criteria entry within the system's database or configuration files.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the Criteria object matching the given criteriaId. Returns
    nullptr if no criteria with the specified ID exists in the manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const Criteria* criteria = criteriaMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nif (criteria\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use criteria data\n    printf(\"Criteria type: %u\\\
      n\", criteria->Type);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Achievement Criteria
    code: "uint32 achievementCriteriaId = 54321;\nconst Criteria* crit = criteriaMgr->GetCriteria(achievementCriteriaId);\n\
      if (crit && crit->Type == CriteriaType::CRITERIA_TYPE_WIN_BG)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ battleground win criteria\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a const data structure.
    The internal lookup mechanism likely uses a hash map or similar structure for
    efficient O(1) access. Ensure that the criteriaId passed is valid to avoid returning
    nullptr.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer, as it points to read-only
    data. Modifying the criteria through this interface may lead to undefined behavior.
    Always check for null return values before dereferencing the pointer.
