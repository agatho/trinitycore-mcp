documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AuctionHouseBot system, setting up internal data structures
    and configuring auction behavior.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the AuctionHouseBot for operation by
    loading configuration settings, initializing internal data structures, and establishing
    necessary hooks or callbacks with the auction house system. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when the bot module is enabled. It ensures that
    all required resources are allocated and that the bot's behavior adheres to configured
    parameters such as item pricing strategies, bid amounts, and auction duration
    settings. The initialization process may also include validating configuration
    files and establishing connections to necessary subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot bot;

      bot.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an AuctionHouseBot
    instance. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method performs no locking internally, so concurrent access from multiple threads
    should be avoided.
