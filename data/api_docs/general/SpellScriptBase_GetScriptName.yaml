  class: SpellScriptBase
  method: GetScriptName
  signature: int SpellScriptBase::GetScriptName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the spell script.
  description: The GetScriptName method returns an integer identifier that uniquely
    represents the spell script within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier
    is typically used internally by the game engine to manage and dispatch spell-related
    events, track script instances, and ensure proper execution context for spell
    effects. The returned value corresponds to a predefined script entry in the database
    or a registered script handler. This method is commonly called during spell initialization,
    activation, or effect application phases to verify or retrieve the script's identification.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier of the spell script. This
    value typically maps to an entry in the spell script table or registry within
    the TrinityCore database system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffect(SpellEffIndex\
      \ effIndex) override\n    {\n        int scriptId = GetScriptName();\n     \
      \   // Use scriptId for logging or conditional logic\n        if (scriptId ==\
      \ 12345)\n        {\n            // Special handling for this specific spell\
      \ script\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the spell lifecycle, particularly
    in effect handlers or initialization routines. The returned identifier should
    be treated as read-only and must not be modified by client code.
  warnings: Do not assume that the script ID directly corresponds to a spell entry
    ID. The mapping between spell IDs and script IDs is handled separately in the
    TrinityCore database configuration.
