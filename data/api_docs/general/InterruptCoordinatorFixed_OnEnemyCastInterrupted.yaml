  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: OnEnemyCastInterrupted
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnEnemyCastInterrupted(int casterGuid,
    uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an enemy's spell cast is interrupted.
  description: The OnEnemyCastInterrupted method is invoked when an enemy caster's
    spell casting process is interrupted, typically due to damage, movement, or other
    game mechanics. This method processes the interruption event for the specified
    caster and spell, potentially triggering additional AI behaviors or state changes
    within the InterruptCoordinatorFixed system. It serves as a core component in
    managing combat interruptions and maintaining proper AI response to dynamic battlefield
    conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the enemy caster whose spell cast
      was interrupted. This value is used to identify the specific unit involved in
      the interruption event.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell that was interrupted. This identifies which specific
      spell casting was disrupted, allowing for targeted handling based on spell properties
      or effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI script
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Example of calling the method\
      \ when an enemy cast is interrupted\n    if (m_interruptCoordinator)\n     \
      \   m_interruptCoordinator->OnEnemyCastInterrupted(m_casterGuid, m_spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat event handling
    code: "void CombatManager::HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* caster, uint32 spellId)\n\
      {\n    if (caster && caster->IsHostileTo(m_player))\n    {\n        InterruptCoordinatorFixed*\
      \ coordinator = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptCoordinator();\n        if (coordinator)\n\
      \            coordinator->OnEnemyCastInterrupted(caster->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within combat-related event handlers
    or AI update loops. It assumes that the caster GUID and spell ID are valid at
    the time of invocation. The method does not perform any direct spell effects or
    visual updates; instead, it coordinates with other systems to handle interruption
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the casterGuid corresponds to a valid enemy unit before calling
    this method. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or system errors. Also, be aware that multiple interruptions can occur rapidly
    during intense combat, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    for high-frequency calls.
