  class: GuildBankManager
  method: IsItemRedundant
  signature: bool GuildBankManager::IsItemRedundant(int * guild, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a guild bank item is redundant based on existing items
    in the guild's inventory.
  description: The IsItemRedundant method checks if a specified item is already present
    in the guild bank in sufficient quantity to make additional instances redundant.
    This function evaluates item stacking rules and guild bank slot availability to
    determine redundancy. It is typically used during item deposit operations to optimize
    storage usage and prevent unnecessary duplication of identical items within the
    guild's bank. The method considers all existing entries of the same item type
    when making its determination.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      likely refers to the guild's unique database ID used for querying guild-specific
      data.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being checked for redundancy. This
      corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database and is used to match against
      existing items in the guild bank.
  returns: Returns true if the item is redundant (i.e., there are already sufficient
    quantities of this item in the guild bank to satisfy any potential need), otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that adding more of this item
    would not be beneficial for storage optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Item Redundancy Before Deposit
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nuint32 itemId = 18765;\nbool isRedundant = GuildBankManager::IsItemRedundant(&guildId,\
      \ itemId);\nif (!isRedundant)\n{\n    // Proceed with depositing the item\n\
      \    guildBank->DepositItem(itemId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item is already sufficiently\
      \ represented in bank\n    SendChatMessage(\"Item is already sufficiently stocked.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the GuildBankTab and GuildBankItem tables
    in the database to retrieve current item counts. It may also consider item stacking
    limits imposed by the game's guild bank system. The method assumes that items
    of the same type are considered redundant if their total stack count meets or
    exceeds what would be needed for normal guild operations.
  warnings: This function should not be called with invalid guild IDs or non-existent
    item IDs, as this could lead to undefined behavior or database access errors.
    Ensure proper validation of input parameters before invoking this method.
