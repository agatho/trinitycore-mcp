  class: AreaTrigger
  method: RelocateStationaryPosition
  signature: void AreaTrigger::RelocateStationaryPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates the area trigger to a new stationary position based on the provided
    index.
  description: The RelocateStationaryPosition method updates the position of an area
    trigger to a predefined stationary location. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage the placement of area triggers such
    as quest objectives, spell effects, or interactive zones. The method accepts an
    integer parameter that serves as an index to determine which predefined stationary
    position to move the area trigger to. It modifies the internal position data of
    the area trigger object without requiring a full recreation or reinitialization
    of the trigger. This functionality is essential for dynamic world events and scripted
    interactions where triggers need to be moved programmatically.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer index that specifies which predefined stationary position
      to relocate the area trigger to. The valid range and specific meanings of this
      index depend on how the area trigger's stationary positions are defined in the
      game data or script configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->RelocateStationaryPosition(2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Moving Trigger Based on Quest State
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n{\n    trigger->RelocateStationaryPosition(0);\n\
      }\nelse if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n   \
      \ trigger->RelocateStationaryPosition(1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the area trigger's position data and should
    be used carefully in threaded environments. The index parameter must correspond
    to a valid stationary position defined for this specific area trigger, otherwise
    behavior is undefined. This method does not perform any validation on the provided
    index value.
  warnings: Using an invalid index value may result in unexpected behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that the index passed to this method corresponds to a valid stationary
    position defined in the game's data files or script configuration. Avoid calling
    this method during critical rendering or update phases of the game loop without
    proper synchronization.
