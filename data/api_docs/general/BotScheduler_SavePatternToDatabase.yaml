  signature: void BotScheduler::SavePatternToDatabase(const std::string & name, const
    ActivityPattern & pattern)
documentation:
  brief: Saves an activity pattern to the database with the specified name.
  description: The SavePatternToDatabase method persists a given ActivityPattern object
    into the TrinityCore database under a specific name. This allows bot behaviors
    and scheduled activities to be stored and retrieved across server sessions. The
    method typically handles serialization of the pattern data and writes it using
    the core database subsystem. It is used primarily by the BotScheduler class to
    maintain persistent configurations for automated bot actions.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the pattern, used as a key in the
      database to store and retrieve the activity pattern.
  - name: pattern
    description: The ActivityPattern object containing the scheduled activities and
      their configurations to be saved into the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Save a simple activity pattern
    code: 'ActivityPattern myPattern;

      // Configure pattern...

      botScheduler.SavePatternToDatabase("DailyQuests", myPattern);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database I/O operations, so it may have performance
    implications if called frequently. It should be used during initialization or
    configuration changes rather than in high-frequency loops.
