  signature: void UnitData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the unit data, resetting all tracked modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the UnitData object. This operation is typically used during synchronization
    processes to indicate that all previously tracked modifications have been acknowledged
    and applied. The changes mask is a bitfield that tracks which fields of the unit's
    data have been modified since the last update, enabling efficient network transmission
    by only sending changed fields. Clearing this mask ensures that subsequent changes
    will be properly detected and transmitted in future updates.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Handler
    code: "void MyUnitUpdateHandler(Unit* unit)\n{\n    // Process unit updates\n\
      \    unit->GetUnitData()->ClearChangesMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying or acknowledging all pending
    changes to avoid missing subsequent modifications. The operation is typically
    performed during the update cycle when synchronization with clients occurs.
