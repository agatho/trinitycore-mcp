  signature: bool TempSummon::CanFollowOwner() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the temporary summon can follow its owner.
  description: The CanFollowOwner method checks if a temporary summon unit is permitted
    to follow its owner within the game world. This functionality is typically used
    in AI logic and summon management systems to control the behavior of summoned
    creatures, such as pets or guardians. The method evaluates internal flags and
    conditions related to the summon's state and ownership rules to determine if following
    is allowed. It plays a key role in maintaining proper summon behavior during combat
    and movement scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the temporary summon is allowed to follow its owner, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the summon's AI will attempt to maintain proximity
    to its owner during movement or combat.
  examples:
  - title: Check if summon can follow owner before issuing move command
    code: "if (tempSummon->CanFollowOwner()) {\n    tempSummon->GetAI()->MoveToOwner();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where summon cannot follow\n    tempSummon->GetAI()->SetCombatMovement(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during AI update cycles and movement logic.
    The result may change dynamically based on the summon's current state, such as
    whether it's in combat or has been commanded to stay in place.
