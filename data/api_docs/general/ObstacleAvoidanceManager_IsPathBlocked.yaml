  method: IsPathBlocked
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::IsPathBlocked(const int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified path is blocked by obstacles in the game world.
  description: The IsPathBlocked method evaluates whether a given path, identified
    by its unique identifier, is currently obstructed by environmental obstacles or
    other entities within the World of Warcraft game world. This functionality is
    crucial for AI pathfinding and movement logic, ensuring that creatures and NPCs
    do not attempt to traverse blocked routes. The method typically integrates with
    the obstacle avoidance system to assess path viability in real-time. It may consider
    various factors such as terrain height differences, object collision data, and
    dynamic environmental elements when making its determination.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: A reference to an integer identifier representing a specific path
      within the navigation system. This value uniquely identifies a path that has
      been previously registered or calculated for avoidance purposes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified path is determined to be blocked by obstacles,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the path cannot be safely
    traversed at this moment due to obstructions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a path is blocked
    code: "int myPathId = 12345;\nif (obstacleManager.IsPathBlocked(myPathId)) {\n\
      \    // Handle blocked path - perhaps find an alternative\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      Path {} is currently blocked.\", myPathId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPathBlocked in AI movement logic
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveToTarget(Position target) {\n  \
      \      int pathId = navigationManager.CalculatePath(GetPosition(), target);\n\
      \        if (pathId != -1 && !obstacleManager.IsPathBlocked(pathId)) {\n   \
      \         // Proceed with movement along the path\n            ExecuteMovement(pathId);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Find alternative route or wait\n         \
      \   FindAlternativeRoute();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal caching or optimization to avoid recalculating
    path states frequently. It is recommended to cache the result of this check if
    it's used multiple times in a short period. The method assumes that the provided
    path identifier is valid and has been previously initialized within the navigation
    system.
  warnings: Ensure that the path identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing registered path; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or result
    in errors. This method should not be called with invalid or uninitialized path
    IDs.
