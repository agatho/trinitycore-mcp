  class: ArenaAI
  method: Execute3v3Strategy
  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute3v3Strategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 3v3 arena strategy for the specified player.
  description: The Execute3v3Strategy method is responsible for implementing the artificial
    intelligence behavior specific to 3v3 arena battles within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method determines how a player-controlled unit should act during a 3v3 battleground
    match, including targeting, spell casting, movement patterns, and overall tactical
    decisions. It typically involves evaluating the current battlefield state, identifying
    priority targets, managing cooldowns, and executing predefined strategies based
    on the player's class and role. The method operates within the context of the
    ArenaAI class which manages AI behavior for arena combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter is used to determine which specific player's
      strategy should be executed and may reference the player's position in the battleground
      team array.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Execute3v3Strategy
    code: 'ArenaAI* arenaAI = new ArenaAI();

      int playerIndex = 0;

      arenaAI->Execute3v3Strategy(&playerIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing strategy for multiple players in a 3v3 team
    code: "ArenaAI* arenaAI = new ArenaAI();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n   \
      \ arenaAI->Execute3v3Strategy(&i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the battleground update cycle and
    should only be invoked when the player is actively participating in a 3v3 arena
    match. The method assumes that the player has been properly initialized with appropriate
    AI settings and that the battleground context is valid.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active 3v3 battleground context may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player parameter points
    to a valid player index within the current arena team to prevent memory access
    violations.
