  class: PersonalPhaseGridLoader
  method: Load
  signature: void PersonalPhaseGridLoader::Load(uint32 phaseId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes phase data for a specific personal phase ID.
  description: The Load method in PersonalPhaseGridLoader is responsible for loading
    and initializing phase-related data associated with a given phase ID. This method
    typically handles the setup of phase masks, grid visibility, and other game state
    elements that are required for a player to properly experience a specific phase
    within the World of Warcraft environment. It ensures that all relevant objects
    and areas are correctly marked for the specified phase, allowing players to see
    or interact with content only available during that particular phase. The method
    is commonly invoked when a player enters a phased area or when phase data needs
    to be refreshed in memory.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseId
    description: The unique identifier for the phase to be loaded. This ID corresponds
      to a specific phase definition in the game's phase system, determining which
      objects, areas, and mechanics are active or hidden for the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Loading
    code: 'PersonalPhaseGridLoader loader;

      loader.Load(12345); // Loads phase data for phase ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Phase Based on Player Context
    code: 'uint32 playerPhaseId = player->GetPhaseMask();

      PersonalPhaseGridLoader loader;

      loader.Load(playerPhaseId); // Loads the current phase of the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login, zone transitions, or
    when entering phased instances. It may trigger updates to grid visibility and
    object state for all players within the affected area. The implementation likely
    involves internal caching mechanisms to avoid redundant loading of identical phase
    data.
  warnings: Calling Load with an invalid or non-existent phaseId may result in undefined
    behavior or missing content for the player. Ensure that the phase ID is validated
    before calling this method, especially when dynamically determining phase IDs
    from game events.
