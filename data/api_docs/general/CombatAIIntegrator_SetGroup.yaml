  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: SetGroup
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::SetGroup(int * group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group identifier for the CombatAIIntegrator instance.
  description: The SetGroup method assigns a group identifier to the CombatAIIntegrator
    object, which is used to manage and coordinate AI behavior within a specific combat
    group. This allows the AI system to differentiate between various groups of enemies
    or allies during combat scenarios. The method accepts a pointer to an integer
    representing the group ID, enabling dynamic assignment of group membership at
    runtime. This functionality is essential for implementing complex AI behaviors
    that require group coordination, such as synchronized attacks or formation-based
    combat strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the group identifier to assign.
      The value pointed to by this parameter will be used as the group ID for this
      CombatAIIntegrator instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Assignment
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      int groupId = 5;

      aiIntegrator.SetGroup(&groupId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Group Assignment
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator* aiUnit = new CombatAIIntegrator();

      int* groupPtr = new int(10);

      aiUnit->SetGroup(groupPtr);

      // Later in code, reassign to different group

      *groupPtr = 15;

      aiUnit->SetGroup(groupPtr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method stores only the value pointed to by the parameter, not a copy
    of the pointer itself. Ensure that the memory pointed to remains valid for the
    lifetime of the CombatAIIntegrator instance. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with other group management functions to implement coordinated AI
    behaviors.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in undefined behavior.
    The integer value pointed to should be a valid group identifier that makes sense
    within the context of your combat system. Be cautious when reassigning group IDs
    dynamically, as it may affect existing group-based AI logic.
