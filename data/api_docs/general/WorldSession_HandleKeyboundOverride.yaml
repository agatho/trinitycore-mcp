documentation:
  brief: Processes keybound override packets sent by the client to update spell keybindings.
  description: The HandleKeyboundOverride method processes incoming keybound override
    data from a WorldSession, allowing players to customize their spell keybindings.
    This method is part of the spell management system in TrinityCore and handles
    updates to how spells are bound to keyboard keys. It typically receives a packet
    containing information about which spells should be remapped to specific key bindings.
    The method validates the provided keybinding data against the player's current
    spell configuration and applies the changes accordingly. This functionality supports
    the in-game ability for players to customize their gameplay controls, enhancing
    user experience by allowing personalization of key layouts.

  - title: Basic Keybound Override Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleKeyboundOverride(WorldPackets::Spells::KeyboundOverride&\
      \ keyboundOverride)\n{\n    // Process the keybound override packet\n    //\
      \ Update player's spell keybindings based on client data\n    // Validate and\
      \ apply changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when a client sends a keybound
    override packet. It should be called only within the context of an active WorldSession
    and assumes that the session has proper authentication and player data loaded.
    The method may perform validation checks to ensure that keybindings are valid
    for the current player's class and spell availability.
  warnings: Improper handling of keybound override packets could lead to invalid keybinding
    states or potential exploits if not properly validated. Always ensure that keybindings
    conform to game rules and player permissions before applying changes.
