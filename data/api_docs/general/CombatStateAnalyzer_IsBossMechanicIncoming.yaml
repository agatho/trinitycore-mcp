  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: IsBossMechanicIncoming
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::IsBossMechanicIncoming(uint32 & spellId, uint32
    & timeUntil) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a boss mechanic is about to be cast and returns the spell ID
    and time until activation.
  description: The IsBossMechanicIncoming method checks whether a boss enemy is about
    to cast a significant combat mechanic that affects player positioning or abilities.
    It evaluates the current combat state and predicts incoming boss abilities based
    on AI behavior patterns and spell casting timers. The method populates the provided
    parameters with the spell ID of the impending mechanic and the estimated time
    (in milliseconds) until it will be cast. This functionality is crucial for player
    AI decision-making, cooldown management, and proactive avoidance strategies during
    boss encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the unique identifier
      of the incoming boss mechanic spell when the method returns true.
  - name: timeUntil
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the estimated time (in
      milliseconds) until the boss mechanic is cast when the method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if a boss mechanic is detected as incoming, false otherwise.
    When true, both spellId and timeUntil parameters are populated with valid values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to detect incoming boss mechanics
    code: "uint32 spellId = 0;\nuint32 timeUntil = 0;\nif (analyzer.IsBossMechanicIncoming(spellId,\
      \ timeUntil)) {\n    printf(\"Incoming mechanic: %u in %u ms\\n\", spellId,\
      \ timeUntil);\n    // Implement avoidance logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method for proactive player AI behavior
    code: "uint32 spellId = 0;\nuint32 timeUntil = 0;\nif (analyzer.IsBossMechanicIncoming(spellId,\
      \ timeUntil)) {\n    if (timeUntil < 1000) { // Less than 1 second\n       \
      \ // Immediately interrupt or move away\n        player->CastSpell(player, spellId,\
      \ true);\n    } else if (timeUntil < 3000) { // Less than 3 seconds\n      \
      \  // Prepare cooldowns and positioning\n        player->SetCanMove(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal boss AI state tracking and may not be accurate
    if the combat state is not properly initialized or if the boss has no active mechanics.
    The timeUntil value represents a prediction based on current AI behavior patterns,
    which may vary depending on boss difficulty and encounter phase.
  warnings: Do not assume that all mechanics detected by this method will occur exactly
    at the predicted time. Boss AI can change behavior dynamically, and the prediction
    is based on historical patterns rather than precise timing. Also, ensure that
    the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is properly initialized before calling this method.
