    target) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates the game object's data values with specified flags and target data.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdate method is responsible for updating the internal
    data values of a GameObject instance based on provided flags and target data.
    This method typically handles the synchronization of object data between client
    and server, ensuring that the game state reflects changes accurately. It is commonly
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework where GameObjects
    represent interactive elements like doors, chests, or other world objects. The
    method operates by modifying the internal data buffer of the GameObject using
    the provided parameters, which are essential for maintaining proper game mechanics
    and synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the data values to be updated.
      This typically contains the object's state information that needs to be synchronized
      with client.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer representing the update flags used for determining which
      data fields should be updated. These flags usually control how the data is processed
      and whether it should be sent to clients or not.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing the target data values that
      will be used in the update process. This represents the source data from which
      updates are derived.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      int data[10] = {0};

      int flags = 0;

      int target[10] = {0};

      go->BuildValuesUpdate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of object update packets and
    requires careful handling of data synchronization. Developers should be aware
    that this method may involve memory management considerations when updating data
    buffers. The method is part of the GameObject's internal update mechanism and
    should not be called directly unless explicitly required by game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object state updates
    or even crashes if data pointers are invalid. It is crucial that developers ensure
    proper memory allocation when using this method, especially in multi-threaded
    environments where concurrent access may occur.
