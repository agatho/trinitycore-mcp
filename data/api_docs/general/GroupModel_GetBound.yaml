  class: GroupModel
  method: GetBound
  signature: const int & GroupModel::GetBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bound value of the group model, which represents a specific constraint
    or limit associated with the group's configuration.
  description: The GetBound method retrieves the bound value from a GroupModel instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this value typically
    defines a boundary or threshold that governs certain behaviors or limitations
    within the group. For example, it might represent the maximum number of members
    allowed in a group, or a specific limit on a group attribute such as loot distribution
    settings. The returned reference allows direct access to the bound value without
    copying, ensuring efficient performance. This method is commonly used during group
    operations like member addition, validation checks, or configuration updates where
    the group's constraints need to be enforced.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the bound value of the
    group model. The value typically defines a limit or constraint on the group's
    behavior, such as maximum members or resource limits. It is guaranteed to be a
    valid integer within the expected range for the group type.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Group Bound Value
    code: "GroupModel* group = ...;\nconst int& bound = group->GetBound();\nif (bound\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use bound value for validation or logic\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Group bound is: \" << bound << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bound Value in Group Validation
    code: "void ValidateGroupMembership(GroupModel* group, int currentMembers)\n{\n\
      \    const int& bound = group->GetBound();\n    if (currentMembers > bound)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle overpopulation\n        std::cout << \"Group exceeds\
      \ maximum allowed members: \" << bound << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the GroupModel
    class. Modifying the value through this reference directly affects the object's
    state. This method is thread-safe if the underlying GroupModel instance is not
    being modified concurrently by other threads.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned reference for modification, as it
    provides direct access to the internal data member. If the GroupModel object is
    shared across threads, ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions
    during read/write operations.
