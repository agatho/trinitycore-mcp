documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for all abilities and talents of the Havoc Demon
    Hunter.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and decrementing
    the cooldown timers associated with all abilities and talents available to a Havoc
    Demon Hunter class. This method is typically called during each update cycle of
    the player's AI or game loop, ensuring that abilities become available again once
    their cooldown periods have expired. It handles internal tracking of cooldown
    states and ensures proper synchronization between the in-game UI and the underlying
    ability mechanics. The method does not directly trigger any actions but rather
    prepares the state for future ability usage by updating timing information.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Other update logic\n    _havocDemonHunter->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain accurate
    cooldown tracking. It is usually invoked by the core game update system and does
    not require manual triggering unless implementing custom behavior.
