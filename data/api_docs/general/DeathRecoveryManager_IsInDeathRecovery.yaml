documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently in a death recovery state.
  description: The IsInDeathRecovery method determines whether the player character
    is currently in a death recovery state, which typically occurs after a player
    has died and is waiting to be resurrected or has chosen to ghost. This state prevents
    certain actions and interactions while the player awaits resurrection. The method
    returns true if the player is in this temporary recovery state, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is integral to the game's death and resurrection mechanics,
    ensuring proper handling of player states during these critical moments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in a death recovery state (e.g.,
    after dying and before being resurrected), or false if the player is not in such
    a state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check death recovery status
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->IsInDeathRecovery()) {\n    // Player\
      \ is in death recovery, prevent certain actions\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You\
      \ are in death recovery and cannot perform this action.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other death-related systems
    to manage player state transitions. It may be called frequently during gameplay,
    so performance should be considered for high-frequency checks.
