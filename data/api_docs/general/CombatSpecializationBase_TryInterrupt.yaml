  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: TryInterrupt
  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::TryInterrupt(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interrupt the target unit's current spell casting.
  description: The TryInterrupt method evaluates whether the current unit can successfully
    interrupt a target unit's ongoing spell cast. It checks various conditions such
    as spell type, casting time, and combat state to determine if an interruption
    is possible. This method is typically used in combat scenarios where players or
    NPCs attempt to disrupt enemy spellcasters. The method returns true if the interruption
    succeeds, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is currently casting a spell and
      may be interrupted.
  returns: Returns true if the target's spell casting was successfully interrupted;
    returns false if the interruption failed or was not possible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->TryInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n  \
      \  // Spell was interrupted\n    player->SendSpellLog(SPELL_LOG_INTERRUPT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interruption Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization() && targetUnit->IsCasting()) {\n \
      \   if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->TryInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n   \
      \     player->AddComboPoints(targetUnit, 1);\n        player->SendSpellLog(SPELL_LOG_INTERRUPT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks based on the target's current spell state
    and the caster's abilities. It may be used in conjunction with other combat mechanics
    such as spell cooldowns, interruptible spell flags, and combat stance requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and actively casting before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameter.
