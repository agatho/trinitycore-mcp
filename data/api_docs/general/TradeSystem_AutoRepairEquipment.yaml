  signature: void TradeSystem::AutoRepairEquipment(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically repairs all damaged equipment for the specified player using
    available gold.
  description: The AutoRepairEquipment method scans a player's inventory for any items
    that are currently damaged (durability below maximum) and repairs them automatically
    if the player has sufficient gold. This method typically triggers when a player
    interacts with a repair NPC or uses a repair spell, ensuring that all equipped
    and backpack items are restored to full durability. The system checks each item's
    current durability and compares it against its maximum durability, repairing only
    those items that require repair. If the player lacks enough gold to cover the
    total repair cost, no repairs will be performed.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      TradeSystem::AutoRepairEquipment(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly interact with the database but relies on internal
    player data structures and gold tracking. It assumes that the player object is
    valid and properly initialized. The repair cost calculation considers item quality,
    level, and type to determine appropriate repair fees.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player has sufficient gold
    to cover all repair costs; otherwise, no repairs will occur. Calling this method
    on a null player pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
