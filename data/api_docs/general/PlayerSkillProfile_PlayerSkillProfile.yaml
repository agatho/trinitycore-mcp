documentation:
  brief: Initializes a player skill profile for the specified player GUID
  description: The PlayerSkillProfile constructor initializes a skill profile for
    a given player by their unique identifier (GUID). This method sets up internal
    data structures to track and manage the player's skills, abilities, and proficiency
    levels within the game system. It typically gets invoked during player login or
    when a new skill profile needs to be created for a character. The method ensures
    that all relevant skill-related data is properly loaded and accessible for gameplay
    mechanics such as spell casting, crafting, and combat abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom the skill profile
      is being initialized. This value should correspond to a valid player entry in
      the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Player Skill Profile
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile profile(12345);

      // Initializes a skill profile for player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player session initialization. Developers should ensure that the provided GUID
    corresponds to an existing player before calling this constructor to avoid undefined
    behavior or database errors.
