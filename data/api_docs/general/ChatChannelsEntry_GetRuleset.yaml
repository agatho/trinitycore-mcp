  signature: ChatChannelRuleset ChatChannelsEntry::GetRuleset() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the ruleset associated with this chat channel entry.
  description: The GetRuleset method returns the ChatChannelRuleset object that defines
    the behavioral and access rules for a specific chat channel. This includes permissions,
    message limitations, and other channel-specific configurations. The returned ruleset
    is immutable and represents the static configuration of the channel as defined
    in the game's database or data files. This method does not perform any runtime
    validation or dynamic adjustments to the ruleset.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ChatChannelRuleset object containing all rule definitions for this chat
    channel entry. The ruleset may include settings such as minimum level requirements,
    allowed message types, and access control parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and inspect channel rules
    code: "ChatChannelsEntry* channel = sChatHandler->GetChannelById(1);\nChatChannelRuleset\
      \ rules = channel->GetRuleset();\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"chat\", \"Channel rules: Min\
      \ Level=%u, Max Messages=%u\", \n            rules.GetMinLevel(), rules.GetMaxMessagesPerMinute());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during channel initialization or when validating
    user access to a channel. The returned ruleset object should be treated as read-only
    and any modifications should be made through appropriate setters or configuration
    interfaces.
