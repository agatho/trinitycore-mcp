documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the guild
  description: The HandleInviteMember method processes an invitation request from
    a guild member to add another player to their guild. It validates that the inviting
    player has sufficient permissions, checks if the target player exists and is eligible
    for guild membership, and sends an invitation notification to the target player.
    The method operates within the TrinityCore framework's WorldSession context and
    handles the necessary game state updates for guild membership management.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player issuing the invite request.
      Used to verify permissions and send responses back to the inviting player.
  - name: name
    description: String view containing the name of the player to be invited. Must
      correspond to an existing character in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic guild invite usage
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      std::string_view playerName = "NewMember";

      player->GetGuild()->HandleInviteMember(session, playerName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the calling player has appropriate guild permissions.
    The actual invitation process involves sending a packet to the target player and
    updating internal guild data structures. Performance is generally low as it only
    handles one invite at a time.
  warnings: Ensure that the session parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Failure to validate the target player's existence may result in undefined
    behavior or error messages.
