  brief: Destroys the BotActionManager instance and cleans up associated resources
  description: The destructor for the BotActionManager class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all allocated resources and ensuring that no memory leaks occur when
    a BotActionManager instance is destroyed. This includes releasing any dynamically
    allocated memory, canceling ongoing actions, and performing necessary cleanup
    operations to maintain system stability. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when a BotActionManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making
    it an essential part of the class's resource management strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotActionManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotActionManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotActionManager
    code: 'BotActionManager* manager = new BotActionManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It's important to ensure that all child objects and resources are properly cleaned
    up before the destructor executes. This destructor is typically part of a larger
    bot management system in TrinityCore, where proper cleanup is essential for maintaining
    server performance and stability.
  warnings: Never call this destructor manually unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor should only be invoked by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are deleted. Calling it manually may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks.
