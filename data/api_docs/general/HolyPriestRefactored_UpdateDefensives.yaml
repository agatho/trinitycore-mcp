  brief: Updates the holy priest's defensive abilities and cooldowns based on current
    game state
  description: The UpdateDefensives method manages the internal state of a holy priest's
    defensive capabilities, including cooldown tracking, mana management, and ability
    prioritization. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to
    ensure that defensive spells are properly scheduled and executed according to
    game mechanics and resource availability. It evaluates the current threat level,
    player health, and available resources to determine when and which defensive abilities
    should be activated or prepared for use.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    _priest->UpdateDefensives();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should be called regularly
    during combat to maintain proper defensive spell management. The implementation
    likely interacts with the player's spell cooldown system and mana pool to ensure
    optimal defensive usage.
