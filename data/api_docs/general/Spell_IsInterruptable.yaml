  signature: bool Spell::IsInterruptable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can be interrupted by damage or other effects.
  description: The IsInterruptable method checks if a spell is susceptible to being
    interrupted by external factors such as damage, movement, or other interruptible
    actions. This method is crucial for determining the behavior of spells during
    combat and when dealing with various game mechanics like casting, channeling,
    or aura effects. It typically returns true for spells that can be interrupted,
    and false for spells that are immune to interruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can be interrupted by external factors such as
    damage or movement, false otherwise. This indicates whether the spell is subject
    to interruption during its execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spell->IsInterruptable()) {\n    // Spell can be interrupted\n    //\
      \ Handle interruptible behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine whether a spell should be interrupted during combat or when certain
    conditions are met. It may also be used in checking if a spell is immune to specific
    types of interruption.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method because not all spells that
    can be interrupted are necessarily interrupted by the same factors. Some spells
    may have special immunity mechanisms or may be interruptible only under certain
    conditions.
