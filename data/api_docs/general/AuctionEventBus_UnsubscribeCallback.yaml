  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: UnsubscribeCallback
  signature: void AuctionEventBus::UnsubscribeCallback(uint32 subscriptionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a previously subscribed callback from the auction event bus using
    its unique subscription ID.
  description: The UnsubscribeCallback method removes a callback function that was
    previously registered with the AuctionEventBus using SubscribeCallback. This method
    takes a subscription ID as input and unregisters the associated callback, preventing
    it from being invoked when auction events occur. The subscription ID is typically
    obtained when calling SubscribeCallback and should be stored by the caller for
    later use in unsubscribing. If an invalid or non-existent subscription ID is provided,
    the behavior is undefined and may result in no-op or unexpected consequences.
    This mechanism allows for dynamic management of event handlers in the auction
    system, enabling efficient cleanup of unused callbacks.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriptionId
    description: The unique identifier returned by SubscribeCallback when registering
      a callback. Used to identify which specific callback should be removed from
      the event bus.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'uint32 mySubscriptionId = auctionEventBus.SubscribeCallback(&MyAuctionCallback);

      // ... some code ...

      auctionEventBus.UnsubscribeCallback(mySubscriptionId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribing in a Cleanup Function
    code: "class AuctionManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Cleanup()\n    {\n        if\
      \ (subscriptionId != 0)\n        {\n            auctionEventBus.UnsubscribeCallback(subscriptionId);\n\
      \            subscriptionId = 0;\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    uint32 subscriptionId\
      \ = 0;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AuctionEventBus maintains internal state to track active subscriptions.
    It's crucial to store the subscription ID returned by SubscribeCallback for proper
    cleanup. Failure to unsubscribe may lead to memory leaks or dangling references
    if the callback object is destroyed before unsubscribing.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or already-unsubscribed subscriptionId may cause undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that subscription IDs are valid and have not been previously
    used in UnsubscribeCallback. Reusing subscription IDs after unsubscribing can
    lead to unexpected event handling.
