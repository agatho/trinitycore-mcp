  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: EnterDungeon
  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::EnterDungeon(uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the process of entering a dungeon for the player
  description: The EnterDungeon method attempts to start the dungeon entry sequence
    for the player associated with this behavior manager. It validates the provided
    dungeon ID against available dungeons and triggers the appropriate quest or teleportation
    logic required to enter the dungeon. The method returns true if the entry process
    was successfully initiated, or false if the dungeon could not be entered due to
    invalid ID, player state, or other game restrictions. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior scripts to automate dungeon entry for players or NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon to enter. This must correspond
      to a valid dungeon entry in the game's database, typically matching entries
      in the `access_requirement` table or similar system.
  returns: Returns true if the dungeon entry process was successfully initiated and
    the player is now in the process of entering the dungeon. Returns false if the
    dungeon could not be entered due to invalid ID, insufficient permissions, player
    state (e.g., already in a dungeon), or other game restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Entry
    code: "if (behaviorManager->EnterDungeon(1234)) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ started entering dungeon\n    sLog->outString(\"Player entered dungeon 1234\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to enter dungeon\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to\
      \ enter dungeon 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dungeon Entry with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = 5678;\nif (behaviorManager->EnterDungeon(dungeonId))\
      \ {\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully initiated entry into dungeon %u\", dungeonId);\n\
      } else {\n    Player* player = behaviorManager->GetPlayer();\n    if (player)\
      \ {\n        player->SendNotification(\"Unable to enter dungeon.\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's dungeon entry system and may interact
    with quest requirements, instance locking, and player state validation. It does
    not guarantee that the player will actually complete the entry process; it only
    initiates it. The actual teleportation or quest progression happens asynchronously.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the dungeon ID is valid
    and accessible to the player. Calling with an invalid dungeonId may result in
    silent failures or unexpected behavior. Also, ensure that the player is not already
    in a dungeon or in a state where entry would be inappropriate (e.g., during combat).
