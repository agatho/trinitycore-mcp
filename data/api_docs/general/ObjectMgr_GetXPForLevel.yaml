documentation:
  brief: Returns the experience points required to reach a specified level
  description: Retrieves the total amount of experience points needed for a player
    to advance from level N-1 to level N. This method is used internally by the game
    engine to calculate experience requirements and is essential for determining when
    players can level up. The returned value represents the cumulative XP required
    to reach that level, not the XP needed for just one level increment. This method
    does not validate the input level, so calling it with invalid levels may return
    unexpected or incorrect values.
  parameters: []
  returns: The total experience points required to reach the specified level. For
    level 1, this typically returns 0 as no experience is needed to start. For higher
    levels, it returns a positive integer value representing the cumulative XP threshold
    for that level.
  examples:
  - title: Get XP Required for Level 10
    code: 'uint32 xpForLevel10 = sObjectMgr->GetXPForLevel(10);

      // Returns the total XP needed to reach level 10 from level 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Experience Needed for Next Level
    code: 'uint8 currentLevel = player->getLevel();

      uint32 currentXP = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_XP);

      uint32 xpForCurrentLevel = sObjectMgr->GetXPForLevel(currentLevel);

      uint32 xpForNextLevel = sObjectMgr->GetXPForLevel(currentLevel + 1);

      uint32 neededXP = xpForNextLevel - currentXP;

      // Calculates how much more XP is needed to level up'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal XP tables that are defined in the game's configuration
    files or database. The values returned may vary depending on the TrinityCore build
    and server configuration, particularly if custom XP multipliers or scaling factors
    are applied. This function is typically called during player level-up checks and
    experience gain calculations.
  warnings: This method assumes valid input levels and does not perform bounds checking.
    Calling with level 0 or extremely high values may result in incorrect behavior
    or overflow issues. It's recommended to validate the level parameter before calling
    this method, especially when used in dynamic contexts.
