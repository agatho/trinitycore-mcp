  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: OnInterruptFailed
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnInterruptFailed(int botGuid, int targetGuid,
    uint32 spellId, const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an interrupt attempt by a bot fails, logging the reason
    and updating internal state.
  description: The OnInterruptFailed method is invoked when a bot's attempt to interrupt
    another unit's spell casting fails. This method logs the failure with associated
    details including the bot's GUID, target's GUID, the spell ID being interrupted,
    and a descriptive reason for the failure. It is part of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed
    class which manages interrupt-related logic in AI behavior. The method does not
    return any value but updates internal tracking mechanisms to reflect the failed
    interrupt attempt. This function is typically called during AI decision-making
    processes when an interrupt action is attempted but does not succeed due to various
    game mechanics such as spell resistance, target immunity, or timing issues.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot attempting the interrupt.
      This value represents the caster unit performing the interrupt action.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit whose spell casting
      is being interrupted. This represents the unit that was casting the spell.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell that was being interrupted. This identifies which
      specific spell casting was disrupted by the interrupt attempt.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the interrupt failed. This may
      include reasons such as 'target immune', 'spell not interruptible', or 'timing
      error'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.OnInterruptFailed(12345, 67890, 1234, "target immune");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI interrupt logic
    code: "void BotAI::AttemptInterrupt()\n{\n    if (!CanInterruptTarget(targetGuid))\n\
      \    {\n        interruptCoordinator->OnInterruptFailed(botGuid, targetGuid,\
      \ spellId, \"spell not interruptible\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // ...\
      \ interrupt logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used for debugging and analytics purposes to track
    interrupt failures in bot behavior. It may also be used to adjust future interrupt
    attempts based on previous failure patterns.
