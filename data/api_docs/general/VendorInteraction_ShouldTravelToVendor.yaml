api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: ShouldTravelToVendor
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::ShouldTravelToVendor(Player * player, uint32
    vendorGuid, float expectedValue)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player should travel to a vendor based on expected value
    and inventory status.
  description: The ShouldTravelToVendor method evaluates if a player's current inventory
    state and the expected value of items available from a specific vendor justify
    traveling to that vendor. This decision is typically made in the context of auction
    house or vendor interaction logic, where the system weighs the potential benefit
    of purchasing items against travel costs or time investment. The method considers
    factors such as item value ratios, player inventory capacity, and economic thresholds.
    It is commonly used in automated trading systems or AI-driven shopping behaviors
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character making the
      vendor interaction decision. Must not be null.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor NPC the player is considering
      visiting. Used to retrieve vendor-specific item data and pricing information.
  - name: expectedValue
    description: Floating-point value representing the expected return or benefit
      from purchasing items at this vendor, typically calculated based on market prices,
      item rarity, and player needs.
  returns: Returns true if the player should travel to the vendor based on the evaluation
    criteria; false otherwise. The decision considers whether the expected value justifies
    the cost of travel or time investment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nfloat expectedValue\
      \ = 500.0f;\nif (VendorInteraction::ShouldTravelToVendor(player, vendorGuid,\
      \ expectedValue)) {\n    // Proceed with vendor interaction logic\n    player->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Traveling to vendor...\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Value Calculation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nfloat expectedValue\
      \ = CalculateExpectedValue(player, vendorGuid);\nif (VendorInteraction::ShouldTravelToVendor(player,\
      \ vendorGuid, expectedValue)) {\n    // Perform vendor visit logic\n    VendorInteraction::VisitVendor(player,\
      \ vendorGuid);\n} else {\n    // Skip vendor visit and consider alternative\
      \ options\n    player->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Skipping vendor\
      \ visit.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's economy system, inventory
    management, and pathfinding modules. It may cache vendor data or use precomputed
    thresholds to improve performance during frequent checks. The expectedValue parameter
    should be calculated using current market data or player-specific needs.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid segmentation faults. The vendorGuid must correspond to an actual NPC in
    the game world, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Incorrect expectedValue calculations
    can lead to suboptimal travel decisions.
