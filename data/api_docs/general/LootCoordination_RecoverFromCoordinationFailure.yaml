  class: LootCoordination
  method: RecoverFromCoordinationFailure
  signature: void LootCoordination::RecoverFromCoordinationFailure(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover loot coordination state after a failure has occurred
    for the specified session.
  description: The RecoverFromCoordinationFailure method is designed to handle situations
    where loot coordination between players has failed, likely due to network issues
    or player disconnection. This function resets the internal state of the loot coordination
    system for a specific session, allowing the system to potentially re-initiate
    coordination or clean up resources associated with that session. It may be called
    automatically by the server when coordination timeouts occur or when manual recovery
    is needed after a failure event. The method ensures that no stale data remains
    in the coordination system for the given session ID.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: The unique identifier of the session for which loot coordination
      failure needs to be recovered. This typically corresponds to a player's session
      or connection identifier within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Recover from loot coordination failure for a specific session
    code: 'LootCoordination* coordination = sLootMgr->GetLootCoordination();

      coordination->RecoverFromCoordinationFailure(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the loot coordination system
    upon detecting a failure condition. It does not guarantee that the loot will be
    redistributed or re-coordinated; it only resets the internal state for the specified
    session.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that the session ID is valid
    before invoking this function.
