  class: PopulationChangedEvent
  method: PopulationChangedEvent
  signature: void PopulationChangedEvent::PopulationChangedEvent(uint32 zone, uint32
    oldCount, uint32 newCount)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PopulationChangedEvent with zone ID, old population count,
    and new population count.
  description: The PopulationChangedEvent constructor initializes an event object
    that tracks changes in player population within a specific zone. This event is
    typically used by the game server to notify systems when the number of players
    in a zone has changed, which can affect various game mechanics such as quest progression,
    instance scaling, or dynamic difficulty adjustments. The event stores the zone
    identifier, the previous population count, and the updated population count for
    processing by event handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where population change occurred.
      This corresponds to the ZoneID used internally by TrinityCore to identify different
      game zones or areas.
  - name: oldCount
    description: The previous number of players in the specified zone before the change
      occurred.
  - name: newCount
    description: The updated number of players in the specified zone after the change
      occurred.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PopulationChangedEvent instance
    code: 'PopulationChangedEvent event(1234, 5, 7);

      // This creates an event indicating that zone 1234 went from 5 to 7 players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game server when player
    movement or login events trigger population updates. The event system may use
    this data to update instance difficulty, quest states, or other zone-dependent
    mechanics.
