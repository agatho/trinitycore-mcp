  method: GetHealthPct
  signature: float PetInfo::GetHealthPct() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current health percentage of the pet.
  description: The GetHealthPct method computes the health percentage of a pet by
    dividing its current health by its maximum health and multiplying by 100. This
    value is expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0
    indicates the pet is dead and 100.0 indicates the pet has full health. The method
    performs no modifications to internal state and is safe for repeated calls during
    gameplay. This functionality is commonly used in user interfaces to display pet
    health bars or in AI logic to determine when a pet should be healed or recalled.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the pet's current health as a percentage of
    its maximum health. Returns 0.0 if the pet has no maximum health or is dead, and
    100.0 if the pet has full health. Values between 0.0 and 100.0 indicate proportional
    health status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to display pet health
    code: "float healthPct = petInfo->GetHealthPct();\nif (healthPct <= 25.0f)\n{\n\
      \    // Display warning or alert\n    sLog->outString(\"Pet health critically\
      \ low: %.2f%%\", healthPct);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using health percentage for AI decision making
    code: "float healthPct = petInfo->GetHealthPct();\nif (healthPct < 50.0f)\n{\n\
      \    // Pet needs healing\n    player->CastSpell(pet, SPELL_HEAL_PET, true);\n\
      }\nelse if (healthPct > 90.0f)\n{\n    // Pet is in good condition\n    pet->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the pet's current and maximum health values being properly
    initialized. If a pet has not been assigned valid health values, the result may
    be undefined or misleading. This method does not account for temporary modifiers
    or buffs that might affect health display in the UI.
  warnings: This method should not be used in performance-critical code paths due
    to potential floating-point precision issues with very small health differences.
    Also, calling this on a null pet reference will result in undefined behavior.
