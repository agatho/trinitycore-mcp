documentation:
  brief: Checks if the spell has a specific aura effect.
  description: The HasAura method determines whether a SpellInfo object contains a
    specific aura effect. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to evaluate spell effects and their interactions with player abilities,
    buffs, debuff, and other game mechanics. It returns true if the specified aura
    is present in the spell, false otherwise. The method is typically used for checking
    aura types such as proc effects, periodic effects, or specific mechanical effects
    that may be applied to spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell contains the specified aura effect, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasAura(SPELL_AURA_PROC_TRIGGER_SPELL))\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ proc trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and can be used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods to determine whether a spell has specific effects.
    Performance considerations are minimal, as this method simply checks internal
    data structures.
  warnings: The method assumes that the aura parameter represents a valid aura type
    enum; incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if invalid values
    are passed.
