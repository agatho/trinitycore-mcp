  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetBotCompletionMetrics
  signature: QuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot QuestCompletion::GetBotCompletionMetrics(uint32
    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves quest completion metrics for a specified bot character by its GUID.
  description: 'The GetBotCompletionMetrics method fetches detailed quest completion
    statistics for a specific bot character identified by its unique game identifier
    (GUID). This function is typically used in automated questing systems or bot management
    modules within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The returned snapshot
    contains comprehensive data about the bot''s quest progress, including completed
    quests, quest timers, and other relevant performance metrics. The method ensures
    thread-safe access to bot-specific data and may cache results for performance
    optimization. Precondition: The specified bot GUID must correspond to an active
    bot character in the game world.'
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which quest
      completion metrics are being retrieved. Must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer
      representing an existing bot in the game world.
  returns: A QuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot object containing detailed quest completion
    data for the specified bot, including completed quests, time spent on quests,
    and performance statistics. Returns an empty snapshot if no matching bot is found
    or if the bot has no recorded quest activity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nQuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot metrics = questCompletion.GetBotCompletionMetrics(botGuid);\n\
      if (!metrics.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process the quest completion data\n    printf(\"\
      Completed %u quests\\n\", metrics.CompletedQuestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nQuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot\
      \ metrics = questCompletion.GetBotCompletionMetrics(botGuid);\n\nif (metrics.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    sLog->outError(\"No quest data found for bot GUID: %u\", botGuid);\n\
      } else {\n    float completionRate = static_cast<float>(metrics.CompletedQuestCount)\
      \ / \n                          static_cast<float>(metrics.TotalQuestCount);\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u completion rate: %.2f%%\", botGuid, completionRate\
      \ * 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal quest tracking data structures and may involve
    database queries for historical quest information. The returned snapshot object
    is designed to be immutable after creation to ensure thread safety during concurrent
    access. Performance considerations include potential caching mechanisms that might
    delay real-time updates of metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID will return
    an empty snapshot without throwing an exception. Ensure proper validation of the
    bot GUID before calling to avoid unexpected behavior. The snapshot data may not
    reflect real-time changes and should be refreshed periodically for accurate reporting.
