  brief: Moves a SupportMgr object to another SupportMgr object, transferring ownership
    of resources.
  description: The SupportMgr move constructor transfers ownership of resources from
    one SupportMgr instance to another. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation
    that allows efficient resource transfer without copying. The source SupportMgr
    object becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used. This method
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate SupportMgr objects
    need to be efficiently transferred to new variables, such as during container
    operations or function returns. The move constructor ensures that any dynamically
    allocated memory or handles are properly transferred rather than duplicated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'SupportMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... initialize sourceMgr ...

      SupportMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Moves resources from sourceMgr
      to newMgr

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<SupportMgr> mgrVector;

      mgrVector.emplace_back(); // Default constructs a SupportMgr

      SupportMgr movedMgr = std::move(mgrVector.front()); // Move the first element

      // mgrVector.front() is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. It's designed to be
    called with an rvalue reference. After calling this constructor, the source object
    should not be used as its state becomes invalid. The move constructor typically
    has no performance overhead compared to a copy constructor and may even be faster
    when dealing with large objects.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that you do not attempt to use the source object after
    calling this move constructor. This is particularly important in multi-threaded
    environments where other threads might access the moved-from object.
