  signature: uint32 Item::GetPaidExtendedCost() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extended cost ID associated with an item's purchase.
  description: This method retrieves the extended cost identifier that is used to
    determine the payment requirements for purchasing an item. The extended cost typically
    represents the currency or items required to buy the item, including any additional
    costs such as reputation or other in-game currency. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with the Item::GetPurchaseCost method to fully understand the item's purchase
    mechanics. This method is essential for determining item pricing and can be used
    in various game systems related to vendor purchases and item acquisition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the extended cost ID associated with the
    item's purchase, which corresponds to entries in the ExtendedCost.dbc file. This
    value may be zero if no extended cost is defined for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 extendedCostId = item->GetPaidExtendedCost();\nif (extendedCostId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Item has an extended cost\n    // Process accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine the full purchase requirements of an item. It should be noted that
    this value may be zero for items without extended costs, and the method does not
    validate whether the extended cost actually exists in the database.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero for items that
    do not have any extended cost defined. Also, ensure that the item object is valid
    before calling this method to avoid memory access violations.
