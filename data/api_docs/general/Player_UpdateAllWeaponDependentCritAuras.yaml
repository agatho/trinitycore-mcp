documentation:
  brief: Updates all weapon-dependent critical strike auras for the player based on
    current equipped weapons and their properties.
  description: This method recalculates and applies or removes critical strike auras
    that are dependent on the player's currently equipped weapons. It ensures that
    any weapon-specific critical strike bonuses, proc effects, or enchantment-based
    crit modifiers are properly reflected in the player's active aura state. The function
    typically gets invoked when weapon stats change, such as when equipping new gear,
    unequipping items, or when weapon properties are modified through enchantments
    or buffs. It is an internal utility method used by the core combat system to maintain
    accurate critical strike calculations for the player.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->UpdateAllWeaponDependentCritAuras();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core when weapon-related changes
    occur, such as equipping/unequipping items or modifying weapon stats. Developers
    should not typically call this method directly unless implementing custom weapon
    stat modification logic.
