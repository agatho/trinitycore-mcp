  brief: Dumps the current priority state of behavior managers to the console or log
    for debugging purposes.
  description: The DumpPriorityState method outputs the internal priority configuration
    and current state of all registered behavior managers within the system. This
    utility function is primarily used during development and debugging to inspect
    how different AI behaviors are prioritized and executed. It typically logs information
    such as behavior IDs, their assigned priorities, active states, and any relevant
    metadata that governs the execution order of AI behaviors in the game world. The
    method does not modify any internal state and serves purely for diagnostic purposes.

  notes: This method is usually compiled in debug builds or enabled via specific compile-time
    flags. It may produce verbose output and should not be called frequently in production
    environments due to performance overhead.
  warnings: The output from this method is intended for developers and may include
    internal identifiers or memory addresses that are not stable across different
    runs or versions of the server.
