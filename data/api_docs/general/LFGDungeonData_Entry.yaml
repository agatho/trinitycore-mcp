  method: Entry
  signature: uint32 LFGDungeonData::Entry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the dungeon entry ID associated with the LFG dungeon data.
  description: The Entry method retrieves the unique identifier for a specific dungeon
    as defined in the LFG (Looking For Group) system. This ID corresponds to the dungeon's
    entry in the game's database and is used to identify which dungeon a player is
    attempting to join or has joined through the LFG system. The returned value typically
    maps to entries in tables such as `lfg_dungeon_template` or similar dungeon-related
    databases within TrinityCore. This method is commonly used when processing LFG
    join requests, checking dungeon availability, or determining which dungeon a player
    is currently queued for.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the dungeon's unique identifier (entry ID)
    in the LFG system. This ID directly corresponds to the dungeon template entry
    and can be used to look up additional dungeon properties such as name, level requirements,
    and group size limits.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Dungeon Entry for Queue Processing
    code: "LFGDungeonData* dungeonData = sLFGMgr->GetDungeonData(12345);\nuint32 entryId\
      \ = dungeonData->Entry();\nif (entryId != 0)\n{\n    // Use entryId to fetch\
      \ dungeon information from database\n    sLog->outString(\"Player queued for\
      \ dungeon with entry ID: %u\", entryId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Entry in LFG Dungeon Matching Logic
    code: "void HandleLFGDungeonJoin(Player* player, uint32 dungeonEntry)\n{\n   \
      \ LFGDungeonData const* dungeon = sLFGMgr->GetDungeonData(dungeonEntry);\n \
      \   if (dungeon && dungeon->Entry() == dungeonEntry)\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with LFG join logic\n        sLFGMgr->Join(player, dungeon);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached data from the LFG dungeon
    template. It does not perform any database lookups or computations. The returned
    value should always be valid for active dungeon entries within the LFG system,
    assuming proper initialization of the LFG manager.
