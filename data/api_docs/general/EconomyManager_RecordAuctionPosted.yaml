api:
  class: EconomyManager
  method: RecordAuctionPosted
  signature: void EconomyManager::RecordAuctionPosted(uint32 itemId, uint32 price)
documentation:
  brief: Records an auction posting event for the specified item and price in the
    economy system.
  description: The RecordAuctionPosted method logs information about a newly created
    auction in the game's economy manager. This function is typically invoked when
    a player successfully lists an item for auction, capturing essential data such
    as the item identifier and the starting bid price. It plays a key role in tracking
    in-game economic activity, supporting features like market analysis, revenue generation,
    and auction house statistics. The method does not validate the input parameters,
    so it's expected that callers ensure itemId and price are valid before invoking
    this function.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being auctioned. Must correspond
      to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: price
    description: The starting price or bid amount for the auction, typically represented
      in copper coins (100 copper = 1 silver).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Posting Recording
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyMgr;

      economyMgr->RecordAuctionPosted(12345, 10000); // Records an auction for item
      ID 12345 at 100 silver'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Auction with Dynamic Item and Price
    code: 'uint32 itemId = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, 0)->GetEntry();

      uint32 price = 50000; // 50 silver

      sEconomyMgr->RecordAuctionPosted(itemId, price);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or logs within the EconomyManager
    class but does not directly interact with the database. It's designed to be lightweight
    and fast to support high-frequency auction events in a multiplayer environment.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId and price are validated before calling this function,
    as invalid values may cause inconsistencies in economy tracking or lead to unexpected
    behavior in related systems.
