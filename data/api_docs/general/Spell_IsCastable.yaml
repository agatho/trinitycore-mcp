  method: IsCastable
  signature: bool Spell::IsCastable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell can be cast based on its current state and conditions.
  description: The IsCastable method evaluates whether a spell is currently in a state
    where it can be cast. This includes checking various preconditions such as the
    caster's validity, mana or power requirements, spell cooldowns, and other game
    mechanics that might prevent casting. The method returns true if all necessary
    conditions are met for the spell to be cast, and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used in spell handling logic to validate whether a spell should proceed with its
    casting sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can currently be cast according to all applicable
    conditions; returns false if any condition prevents casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Casting Logic
    code: "if (spell->IsCastable()) {\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n    spell->Cast();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid cast state\n    SendCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_CASTER_DEAD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Spell Validation
    code: "Spell* spell = player->GetSpellHistory()->GetSpell();\nif (spell && spell->IsCastable())\
      \ {\n    // Validate and cast the spell\n    if (player->CanCastSpell(spell))\
      \ {\n        player->CastSpell(target, spell->m_spellInfo, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before initiating a spell's casting process
    to avoid unnecessary processing or invalid operations. It does not account for
    real-time changes in the caster's state during the cast time window, so additional
    checks may be needed during the actual casting phase.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for final validation during spell execution,
    as conditions might change between the time of check and actual cast. Also, ensure
    that the Spell object is valid before calling this method to prevent undefined
    behavior.
