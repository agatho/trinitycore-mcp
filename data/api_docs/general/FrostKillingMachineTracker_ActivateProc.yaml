  class: FrostKillingMachineTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void FrostKillingMachineTracker::ActivateProc(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a proc effect with the specified stack count for the Frost Killing
    Machine tracker.
  description: The ActivateProc method is used to trigger or enable a proc effect
    within the FrostKillingMachineTracker class. This method takes a uint32 parameter
    representing the number of stacks that should be applied to the proc effect. The
    method likely modifies internal state variables to reflect the activation and
    may interact with game mechanics such as spell effects, damage calculations, or
    cooldown management. It is typically called when certain conditions are met in
    the game logic, such as when a player's Frost Killing Machine weapon procs an
    effect based on specific combat actions or damage dealt.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to apply to the proc effect. Valid values are
      typically positive integers representing the count of proc applications. Higher
      stack counts may increase the potency or duration of the proc effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Activation
    code: 'FrostKillingMachineTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(3); // Activates the proc with 3 stacks'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Stack Activation Based on Damage
    code: 'uint32 damageDealt = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_DAMAGE_DONE_MODS);

      uint32 stackCount = damageDealt / 1000; // Example calculation

      tracker.ActivateProc(stackCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables such as proc counters,
    cooldown timers, or effect durations. It may also trigger additional game events
    or callbacks related to the Frost Killing Machine's functionality. The exact behavior
    depends on how the tracker is implemented within the broader TrinityCore system.
  warnings: Ensure that the stacks parameter does not exceed maximum allowed values
    for the proc effect, as this could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Avoid
    calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper validation to prevent
    performance issues.
