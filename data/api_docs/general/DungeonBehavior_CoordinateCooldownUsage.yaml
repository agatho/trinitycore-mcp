api:
  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CoordinateCooldownUsage
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateCooldownUsage(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates cooldown usage among group members during dungeon encounters.
  description: The CoordinateCooldownUsage method manages and synchronizes cooldown
    timers for abilities or spells used by group members during dungeon encounters.
    It ensures that cooldowns are properly tracked and shared across the group to
    prevent overlapping or excessive usage of powerful abilities. This method is typically
    invoked during encounter logic to maintain balanced gameplay and enforce proper
    cooldown mechanics within the context of a dungeon scenario.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group currently
      engaged in the dungeon encounter.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter being processed, including its mechanics and cooldown requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Logic
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateCooldownUsage(group, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's cooldown system and may update
    shared cooldown timers for abilities that affect the entire group. It should be
    called at appropriate points during an encounter to maintain synchronization.
