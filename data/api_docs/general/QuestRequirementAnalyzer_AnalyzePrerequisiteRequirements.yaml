  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzePrerequisiteRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzePrerequisiteRequirements(const
    Quest * quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes prerequisite requirements for a quest and updates the issue count
    for a player bot.
  description: The AnalyzePrerequisiteRequirements method evaluates whether a player
    bot meets all necessary prerequisites to accept or complete a given quest. It
    checks various conditions such as level requirements, previous quest completions,
    faction standings, and other in-game criteria that must be satisfied before the
    quest can be interacted with. The method modifies the issues parameter to reflect
    any missing or unsatisfied prerequisites found during analysis. This functionality
    is typically used by questing bots or automated systems to determine quest eligibility
    and identify potential blockers.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs prerequisite checking. Must
      not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot being analyzed
      for quest eligibility. Must not be null.
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented for each prerequisite
      requirement that is not met. This value is modified in-place during analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Prerequisite Analysis
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* bot = ...;\
      \ // Get player reference\nint issueCount = 0;\nQuestRequirementAnalyzer analyzer;\n\
      analyzer.AnalyzePrerequisiteRequirements(quest, bot, issueCount);\nif (issueCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Handle quest eligibility issues\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ has %d prerequisite issues with quest %u\", issueCount, quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks against the player's current state including
    level, completed quests, faction status, and other game-specific conditions. It
    is designed to be called during automated questing processes where bots need to
    determine if they can proceed with a quest. The issues parameter accumulates all
    detected problems, making it useful for debugging or logging purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and bot parameters are valid non-null pointers
    before calling this method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Additionally, this method does not modify the player's quest state
    directly; it only analyzes requirements and reports issues.
