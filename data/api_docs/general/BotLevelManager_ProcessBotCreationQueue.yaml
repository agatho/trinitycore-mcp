  class: BotLevelManager
  method: ProcessBotCreationQueue
  signature: uint32 BotLevelManager::ProcessBotCreationQueue(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the bot creation queue and returns the number of bots successfully
    created.
  description: The ProcessBotCreationQueue method handles the internal queue of bot
    creation requests within the BotLevelManager. It iterates through pending bot
    creation tasks, validates each request, and attempts to create the specified number
    of bots up to the maximum limit provided. This method is typically invoked during
    server updates or when new bots need to be added to the game world. The method
    ensures that bot creation respects server limits and resource availability. It
    may perform checks such as account validation, character slot availability, and
    server load balancing before proceeding with actual bot creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of bots successfully created during this processing
    cycle. A return value of zero indicates no bots were created, which could be due
    to queue exhaustion, resource constraints, or validation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 createdBots = botLevelManager->ProcessBotCreationQueue(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing All Available Bots
    code: uint32 totalCreated = botLevelManager->ProcessBotCreationQueue(UINT32_MAX);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the server's main loop or scheduled
    tasks. It may block briefly while processing bot creation requests, especially
    if there are many pending creations. The method respects the maximum bot limit
    to prevent server overload.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very high maxBots value can lead to performance
    degradation or server instability. Ensure that the parameter is bounded appropriately
    based on server capacity and available resources.
