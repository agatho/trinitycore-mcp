  class: BotMemoryProfile
  method: BotMemoryProfile
  signature: void BotMemoryProfile::BotMemoryProfile(uint32_t guid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a bot memory profile with the specified GUID.
  description: The BotMemoryProfile constructor initializes a new memory profile for
    a bot using the provided unique identifier (GUID). This method sets up internal
    data structures that store memory-related information for the bot, such as recent
    actions, target preferences, and behavioral patterns. The GUID parameter uniquely
    identifies which bot instance this profile belongs to within the TrinityCore system.
    This initialization is typically called during bot creation or when loading an
    existing bot's memory state from persistent storage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the memory profile
      is being initialized. This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a unique entity in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Memory Profile Initialization
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotMemoryProfile memoryProfile(botGuid);

      // Initializes a new memory profile for the bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Bot Memory Profiles
    code: "std::vector<BotMemoryProfile> profiles;\nfor (uint32_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n\
      {\n    uint32_t guid = 1000 + i;\n    profiles.emplace_back(guid);\n}\n// Creates\
      \ memory profiles for 10 different bots"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no validation on the GUID parameter. It is assumed that
    the caller provides a valid and unique GUID. The constructor may allocate internal
    memory structures based on the GUID, so it should be called only once per bot
    instance to avoid memory leaks or duplicate allocations.
  warnings: Calling this constructor with an invalid or non-unique GUID can lead to
    undefined behavior or conflicts in the bot management system. Ensure that each
    bot has a distinct GUID before calling this method.
