  class: GatheringManager
  method: DetectHerbNodes
  signature: int GatheringManager::DetectHerbNodes(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Detects herb nodes within a specified range and returns the count of found
    nodes.
  description: The DetectHerbNodes method scans the surrounding area for herb nodes
    within the given range and identifies all valid herb resources. This method is
    typically used by players or NPCs with gathering abilities to locate nearby herbal
    resources such as herbs, roots, or other gatherable plants. It performs a spatial
    search in the game world to find nodes that match the criteria for herbs, considering
    the player's current position and the specified detection range. The method returns
    an integer representing the number of herb nodes detected within range.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of herb nodes found within the
    specified range. Returns zero if no herb nodes are detected or if the range is
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int herbCount = gatheringManager.DetectHerbNodes(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player's Current Range
    code: 'float playerRange = player->GetMap()->GetVisibilityDistance();

      int herbsFound = gatheringManager.DetectHerbNodes(playerRange);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial queries or raycasting to detect nodes in
    the game world. It may be optimized for performance by caching previous searches
    or limiting the number of nodes processed per tick. The range parameter is typically
    interpreted as a radius around the player's current position.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value passed is valid and not excessively large,
    as this could cause performance issues or unintended behavior in the game world.
    This method may not detect nodes that are obstructed by terrain or other objects
    unless those are explicitly handled by the underlying detection logic.
