  signature: float PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetItemLevelMultiplier(uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the item level multiplier based on the provided player
    level for trade configuration purposes.
  description: The GetItemLevelMultiplier method computes a floating-point multiplier
    that adjusts item values according to the player's level in the context of trading
    mechanics. This is typically used within player bot AI systems to determine appropriate
    item quality or value thresholds when engaging in trades. The multiplier may be
    applied to scale item stats, prices, or other trade-related attributes based on
    the player's current level. This method does not modify any internal state and
    serves purely as a calculation utility for trade decision-making logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated item level multiplier. The exact
    formula is implementation-specific but generally increases with player level to
    reflect higher item quality expectations or scaling factors in trade negotiations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float multiplier = playerbotTradeConfig->GetItemLevelMultiplier(60);

      // Returns a float value used for scaling item values at level 60'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger trade configuration system that adjusts
    bot behavior based on player progression. It may be called frequently during trade
    evaluations, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
