  class: Object
  method: ReplaceAllDynamicFlags
  signature: void Object::ReplaceAllDynamicFlags(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all dynamic flags of the object with a new set of flags.
  description: This method replaces all existing dynamic flags of an Object with a
    new set of flags specified by the input parameter. It is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to update the dynamic flags of game objects,
    creatures, or players. The method ensures that only the specified flags are active,
    effectively clearing any previous dynamic flags and setting new ones. This operation
    is typically performed during object initialization or flag updates to maintain
    proper game state and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The new set of dynamic flags to apply to the object. This parameter
      defines which flags are active, with each bit representing a specific dynamic
      flag type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->ReplaceAllDynamicFlags(0x1F); // Sets flags 0x1F (5 flags)

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other flag-related methods
    to ensure proper object state management. It may be called during initialization
    or when updating object states in response to game events.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object behavior or game
    state issues. Ensure that the flags being set are valid and appropriate for the
    object type being modified.
