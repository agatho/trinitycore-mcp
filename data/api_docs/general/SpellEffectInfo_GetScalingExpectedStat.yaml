  signature: int SpellEffectInfo::GetScalingExpectedStat() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the expected stat value for scaling calculations in spell effects.
  description: The GetScalingExpectedStat method returns an integer representing the
    expected stat value that is used for scaling calculations within a spell effect.
    This value typically corresponds to a specific stat (such as attack power or spell
    power) that influences how the spell's effect scales with player attributes. The
    returned value may be used in computations related to dynamic spell modifiers,
    scaling coefficients, or stat-based multipliers during spell execution. This method
    is primarily utilized in the context of spell processing and stat scaling mechanics
    within TrinityCore's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the expected stat value for scaling calculations.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on the spell effect's configuration, but
    it generally corresponds to a base stat that affects how the spell scales with
    player attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Processing
    code: "SpellEffectInfo const* effect = spellInfo->GetEffect(0);\nint expectedStat\
      \ = effect->GetScalingExpectedStat();\n// Use expectedStat for scaling calculations\n\
      if (expectedStat > 0)\n{\n    // Apply stat-based scaling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect information structure and should
    only be called on valid SpellEffectInfo objects. The returned value may be zero
    or negative in cases where no specific stat scaling is defined for the effect.
