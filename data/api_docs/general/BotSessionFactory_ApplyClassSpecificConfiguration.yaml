  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration
  signature: void BotSessionFactory::ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Applies class-specific configuration settings to a bot session based on the
    player's class.
  description: The ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration method configures a bot session
    according to the specified player class. This method ensures that bots are properly
    initialized with appropriate behavior, abilities, and settings that match their
    designated class. It typically handles class-specific spell selections, talent
    builds, gear preferences, and other gameplay mechanics relevant to the chosen
    class. The configuration is applied to the provided session object, modifying
    its internal state to reflect class-appropriate parameters. This method is usually
    invoked during bot creation or when switching classes to maintain proper bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that will receive class-specific
      configuration settings. Must not be null.
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class identifier of the player (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE).
      Valid values are defined in the TrinityCore class enumeration system.
  returns: None. This method modifies the session object in-place and does not return
    any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> botSession = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);

      uint8 playerClass = CLASS_MAGE;

      BotSessionFactory::ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration(botSession, playerClass);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Configuration for Different Classes
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> warriorBot = std::make_shared<BotSession>(warriorGuid);

      std::shared_ptr<BotSession> priestBot = std::make_shared<BotSession>(priestGuid);


      BotSessionFactory::ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration(warriorBot, CLASS_WARRIOR);

      BotSessionFactory::ApplyClassSpecificConfiguration(priestBot, CLASS_PRIEST);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot system's initialization process and should
    be called before the session becomes active. The configuration applied may include
    spell selection, item preferences, and behavior patterns specific to each class.
    Implementation details may vary depending on the TrinityCore version and bot module
    being used.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerClass parameter is a valid class identifier; invalid
    values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect bot configuration. This method
    modifies the session object directly, so it should only be called when the session
    is in an appropriate state for configuration.
