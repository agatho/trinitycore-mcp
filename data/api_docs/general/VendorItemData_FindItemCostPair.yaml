  class: VendorItemData
  method: FindItemCostPair
  signature: const VendorItem * VendorItemData::FindItemCostPair(uint32 item_id, uint32
    extendedCost, uint8 type) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a vendor item cost pair matching the specified item ID,
    extended cost, and type.
  description: The FindItemCostPair method searches through the vendor's item list
    to locate a specific item that matches the provided item ID, extended cost, and
    type. This method is typically used in the context of vendor interactions within
    World of Warcraft, where items may have different pricing mechanisms such as regular
    gold costs or alternative currency requirements (extended costs). The method returns
    a pointer to the matching VendorItem structure if found, or nullptr if no match
    exists. It's commonly used when validating purchases or determining item availability
    and cost for players interacting with vendors.
  parameters:
  - name: item_id
    description: The unique identifier of the item to search for in the vendor's inventory.
  - name: extendedCost
    description: The extended cost ID used for alternative currency requirements (e.g.,
      honor points, arena points).
  - name: type
    description: The type of cost to match (typically 0 for regular items, or other
      values for special pricing types).
  returns: A pointer to the VendorItem structure that matches all specified criteria,
    or nullptr if no matching item is found.
  examples:
  - title: Find a vendor item with specific extended cost
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetVendorItems();\n\
      const VendorItem* item = vendorData->FindItemCostPair(12345, 67890, 0);\nif\
      \ (item != nullptr) {\n    // Item found with matching criteria\n    printf(\"\
      Found item with cost: %u\\n\", item->item); \n} else {\n    // No matching item\
      \ found\n    printf(\"Item not available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the vendor's item list, so performance
    may degrade with large inventories. It is recommended to cache results when performing
    frequent lookups. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe for
    concurrent access.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method; invalid
    item IDs or extended costs may lead to unexpected behavior. Be cautious when using
    this in performance-critical code paths due to its linear search nature.
