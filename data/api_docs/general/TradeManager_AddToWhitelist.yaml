  class: TradeManager
  method: AddToWhitelist
  signature: void TradeManager::AddToWhitelist(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player GUID to the trade whitelist for the current player.
  description: The AddToWhitelist method adds a specified player's global unique identifier
    (GUID) to the trade whitelist of the calling player. This functionality is used
    in World of Warcraft's trading system to allow specific players to trade with
    the current player, regardless of normal trading restrictions such as faction
    or level differences. The method does not perform any validation on the GUID itself,
    so it is assumed that the caller has already verified the validity of the GUID
    before invoking this function. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    other trade management functions within the TradeManager class.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to
      the whitelist. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from game objects
      or player data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get reference to player

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      player->GetTradeData()->GetTradeManager()->AddToWhitelist(targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal trade whitelist data structures. It should
    only be called when the player has permission to modify their trade settings,
    typically within a secure game context. The implementation likely involves checking
    for duplicate entries and maintaining an efficient lookup structure for quick
    access during trade operations.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the GUID corresponds to an actual
    online player or if the player is eligible for trading. Calling this method with
    invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or errors during
    actual trade execution. Ensure proper validation before calling.
