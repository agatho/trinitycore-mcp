documentation:
  brief: Moves all creatures in the map's movement list to their new positions.
  description: The MoveAllCreaturesInMoveList method processes and executes all pending
    movement updates for creatures currently registered in the map's movement list.
    This method is typically invoked during the map's update cycle to synchronize
    creature positions with their intended destinations. It ensures that all creatures
    are moved according to their current movement paths, whether they are walking,
    running, or following scripted behaviors. The method operates on the map's internal
    list of creatures that have pending movement operations and applies these changes
    in a controlled manner to maintain game state consistency.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map update loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   MoveAllCreaturesInMoveList();\n    // ... continue with other updates ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core map update cycle and should only be called
    during the appropriate update phase. It's designed to be thread-safe in the context
    of TrinityCore's threading model, but direct calls from outside the main update
    loop may cause synchronization issues. The movement list is typically populated
    by various subsystems including AI, pathfinding, and player interaction systems.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal map update cycle can lead to
    inconsistent game state or race conditions. It should not be invoked concurrently
    with other methods modifying creature positions or movement data. Developers should
    avoid calling this directly unless implementing custom map behavior that requires
    manual control over creature movement processing.
