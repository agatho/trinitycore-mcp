documentation:
  brief: Builds a spatial index for quest-related data to optimize location-based
    queries.
  description: The BuildSpatialIndex method constructs a spatial data structure that
    enables efficient retrieval of quest-related objects based on their geographical
    positions. This is particularly useful in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment
    where quests are often tied to specific locations within the game world. The method
    typically processes quest givers, quest objectives, and other location-dependent
    entities to create an optimized index for fast lookups. It should be called after
    initial data loading or when spatial data has been modified to maintain query
    performance. This method is part of the QuestHubDatabase class which manages quest-related
    database operations.

    code: 'QuestHubDatabase db;

      db.BuildSpatialIndex();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive and should not be called frequently
    during normal gameplay. It's recommended to execute this method during server
    startup or maintenance windows. The spatial index built by this method is typically
    used internally by the quest system for optimizing queries related to quest availability,
    objective locations, and player proximity checks.
  warnings: Calling this method while active quest queries are in progress may lead
    to inconsistent results or performance degradation. Ensure all quest-related operations
    are paused before invoking this method. This method modifies internal data structures
    that affect how quests are processed, so it should only be called when the database
    is in a consistent state.
