  class: MageAI
  method: UseFlamestrike
  signature: void MageAI::UseFlamestrike(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Flamestrike spell against a specified number of enemies.
  description: The UseFlamestrike method is responsible for casting the Flamestrike
    spell in the MageAI class, targeting a given number of enemies. This method typically
    evaluates the current combat situation and determines whether it's appropriate
    to use Flamestrike based on factors such as mana availability, enemy proximity,
    and threat levels. The spell deals fire damage over time to all enemies within
    its area of effect. It is part of the Mage's offensive spell rotation and is generally
    used when multiple enemies are clustered together to maximize damage efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: The number of enemies that will be affected by the Flamestrike spell.
      This value determines how many targets within the spell's area of effect will
      take damage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MageAI::UseFlamestrike(const int& enemies)\n{\n    if (enemies > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Cast Flamestrike spell targeting 'enemies' number of targets\n\
      \        DoCastSpell(enemies, SPELL_FLAMESTRIKE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Flamestrike Usage
    code: "void MageAI::UseFlamestrike(const int& enemies)\n{\n    if (enemies >=\
      \ 3 && HasManaForSpell(SPELL_FLAMESTRIKE))\n    {\n        // Only cast if there\
      \ are at least 3 enemies and sufficient mana\n        DoCastSpell(enemies, SPELL_FLAMESTRIKE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already evaluated whether Flamestrike
    is a suitable spell to cast. The actual spell casting logic may be handled by
    a separate function or system within the MageAI class. It's important to consider
    mana costs and cooldowns when calling this method in a real-world implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'enemies' parameter is properly validated before use,
    as negative values could lead to undefined behavior. Also, make sure that Flamestrike
    is not cast in situations where it would be ineffective or against invalid targets.
