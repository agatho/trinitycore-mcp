documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal sample count processed by the scoped ML operation.
  description: The SetSamplesProcessed method is used to set the number of samples
    that have been processed within a scoped machine learning operation. This method
    typically updates an internal counter or state variable within the ScopedMLOperation
    class, which may be used for tracking progress, logging, or synchronization purposes
    during machine learning computations in the TrinityCore environment. The method
    does not perform any complex operations but serves as a simple setter for the
    sample count, likely used in conjunction with other ML-related methods to manage
    the lifecycle of a machine learning task.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScopedMLOperation operation;

      operation.SetSamplesProcessed(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Sample Count During Processing
    code: "ScopedMLOperation mlOp;\nfor (uint32_t i = 0; i < totalSamples; ++i)\n\
      {\n    // Process sample\n    if ((i + 1) % 100 == 0)\n        mlOp.SetSamplesProcessed(i\
      \ + 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in the context of machine learning or data processing
    within TrinityCore's AI or simulation systems. It may be called from multiple
    threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken into account if the internal
    state is accessed concurrently.
