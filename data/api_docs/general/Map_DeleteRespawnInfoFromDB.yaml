documentation:
  brief: Deletes respawn information for a specific spawn object from the database
  description: The DeleteRespawnInfoFromDB method removes stored respawn data for
    a given spawn object type and identifier from the database. This function is typically
    used during map loading or cleanup processes to ensure that stale or outdated
    respawn information does not persist in the database. The method accepts a spawn
    object type, a unique spawn identifier, and an optional database transaction parameter
    to manage the deletion within a larger transaction context. It directly interacts
    with the database layer to perform the removal operation.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of spawn object to delete respawn info for. This is typically
      an enum value indicating whether the object is a creature, gameobject, or other
      spawnable entity type.
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific spawn instance to remove respawn
      data for. This ID corresponds to the spawn's entry in the database.
  - name: dbTrans
    description: Optional database transaction handle. If provided, the deletion will
      be executed within the context of this transaction, allowing for batch operations
      or rollback capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete creature respawn info
    code: 'Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      map->DeleteRespawnInfoFromDB(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, 12345, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delete gameobject respawn info within transaction
    code: 'Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      DatabaseTransaction trans = Database.GetTransaction();

      map->DeleteRespawnInfoFromDB(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, 67890, trans);

      Database.ExecuteTransaction(trans);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the database and should be used carefully during
    map transitions or server maintenance. It's recommended to use this function only
    when you're certain that the respawn data is no longer needed, as it cannot be
    undone without a database backup.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may result in loss of valid respawn data,
    potentially causing creatures or gameobjects to not respawn correctly after being
    killed or destroyed. Always verify that the spawn ID and type are correct before
    calling this function.
