  signature: const int & ObjectMgr::GetQuestTemplatesAutoPush() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the auto-push quest template ID stored in the ObjectMgr
    instance.
  description: The GetQuestTemplatesAutoPush method retrieves a constant reference
    to an integer value representing the auto-push quest template ID. In World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore, auto-push quests are those that are automatically offered
    to players under certain conditions without requiring manual interaction. This
    method provides access to the internal storage of this specific quest template
    identifier used by the ObjectMgr for managing quest-related data. The returned
    reference points to a static or cached value within the ObjectMgr instance, ensuring
    consistency across calls and avoiding unnecessary copies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the auto-push quest template
    ID. This ID corresponds to a specific quest template in the game's database that
    is configured for automatic delivery to players.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Auto-Push Quest Template ID
    code: "int autoPushQuestId = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplatesAutoPush();\nif (autoPushQuestId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the quest template ID for further processing\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auto-push quest template ID: %d\", autoPushQuestId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal member variable, so modifications
    to the returned value will not affect the actual stored data. The returned value
    is typically initialized during server startup from database configuration or
    defaults. This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a constant reference.
