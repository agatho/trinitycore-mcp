  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: GetTolerancePercent
  signature: float BotLevelDistribution::GetTolerancePercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the tolerance percentage value used for bot level distribution calculations.
  description: The GetTolerancePercent method retrieves the configured tolerance percentage
    that determines how much variation in bot levels is allowed within a specified
    range. This value is crucial for maintaining balanced gameplay when distributing
    bots across different level brackets. The tolerance percentage influences the
    probability distribution of bot assignments and affects overall server balance.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is typically called during
    bot initialization or level adjustment processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the tolerance percentage. This value typically
    ranges from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 means no tolerance (exact level matching)
    and higher values allow for greater variation in assigned bot levels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float tolerance = botLevelDistribution.GetTolerancePercent();

      printf("Bot level tolerance: %.2f%%\n", tolerance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Tolerance in Level Assignment Logic
    code: 'float tolerance = botLevelDistribution.GetTolerancePercent();

      int targetLevel = 45;

      int minLevel = static_cast<int>(targetLevel * (1.0f - tolerance / 100.0f));

      int maxLevel = static_cast<int>(targetLevel * (1.0f + tolerance / 100.0f));

      printf("Assigning bots between levels %d and %d\n", minLevel, maxLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not perform any calculations or modifications.
    The returned value should be treated as a constant during the lifetime of the
    BotLevelDistribution object unless explicitly changed through a corresponding
    setter method. This tolerance value directly impacts the distribution algorithm's
    effectiveness in maintaining balanced bot populations across different level ranges.
