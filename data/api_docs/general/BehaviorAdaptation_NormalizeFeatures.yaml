  method: NormalizeFeatures
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::NormalizeFeatures(int & features) const
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes the feature values of the behavior adaptation to ensure they fall
    within a consistent range.
  description: The NormalizeFeatures method adjusts the internal feature data of a
    BehaviorAdaptation object to maintain normalized values, typically scaling them
    to a fixed range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This ensures that features with different
    magnitudes do not disproportionately influence behavior decisions. The normalization
    process is essential for maintaining consistent AI decision-making across varying
    input conditions. The method modifies the feature data in-place and does not return
    any value. It is commonly used during AI training or runtime adaptation to keep
    feature vectors stable and predictable.

  - title: Basic Usage of NormalizeFeatures
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      int features = 50; // Example feature value

      behavior.NormalizeFeatures(features);

      // The ''features'' variable now contains the normalized value.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input parameter in-place. Ensure that the feature
    data is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
    The normalization algorithm used internally may depend on the specific implementation
    of BehaviorAdaptation, but typically involves min-max scaling or z-score normalization.
  warnings: Calling NormalizeFeatures with uninitialized or invalid feature values
    can lead to unpredictable results. Always validate input data before passing it
    to this method.
