  method: QuestStrategy
  signature: void QuestStrategy::QuestStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestStrategy instance with default settings and configurations.
  description: The QuestStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the QuestStrategy
    class, setting up internal data structures and default values required for quest-related
    AI behavior. This method is typically called when creating a new quest strategy
    object for use in NPC quest handling systems. The initialization process includes
    setting up default quest selection criteria, initializing internal state variables,
    and preparing the strategy for integration with the TrinityCore quest system.
    This constructor does not require any parameters and performs all necessary setup
    internally.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new QuestStrategy instance
    code: 'QuestStrategy* strategy = new QuestStrategy();

      // The strategy is now initialized and ready for use in quest handling

      strategy->Initialize(); // Example of subsequent initialization call'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when quest strategies are dynamically allocated. Developers should not need to
    directly instantiate QuestStrategy objects unless implementing custom quest AI
    logic. The class likely implements reference counting or smart pointer patterns
    for memory management.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in most cases - it's intended for
    internal use by the TrinityCore framework. Direct instantiation may lead to improper
    initialization of internal systems required for proper quest handling behavior.
