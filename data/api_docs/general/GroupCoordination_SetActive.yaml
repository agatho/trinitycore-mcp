  class: GroupCoordination
  method: SetActive
  signature: void GroupCoordination::SetActive(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active state of the group coordination object.
  description: The SetActive method configures whether the group coordination instance
    is currently active or inactive. This flag typically controls whether the group
    coordination system processes events, sends messages, or participates in group
    activities. When set to true, the coordination object becomes active and may begin
    handling group-related operations such as loot distribution, role assignments,
    or synchronization tasks. When set to false, it disables these operations. The
    method does not validate the current state of the group or perform any complex
    logic beyond setting the internal boolean flag.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: A boolean value indicating the desired active state. True activates
      the coordination object, false deactivates it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Group Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = new GroupCoordination();

      coord->SetActive(true); // Enable group coordination'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate Group Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->SetActive(false); // Disable group coordination

      // Prevents further group synchronization operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage group state transitions. It's important to note that setting the active
    state may not immediately affect all ongoing operations, as some group coordination
    tasks might be in progress and need to complete before the new state takes full
    effect.
