  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: SetBatchSize
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::SetBatchSize(uint32 batchSize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the batch size for bot spawn events in the event bus.
  description: The SetBatchSize method configures the maximum number of bots that
    can be processed in a single batch during spawn events. This parameter controls
    how many bot spawning operations are grouped together for efficiency, particularly
    when handling large numbers of bot spawns simultaneously. The batch size affects
    performance by reducing the overhead of individual event processing while ensuring
    system resources are not overwhelmed. This setting is typically used in conjunction
    with other bot management systems to optimize server performance during high bot
    activity periods.
  parameters:
  - name: batchSize
    description: The maximum number of bots to process in a single batch during spawn
      events. Valid values are positive integers. Larger batch sizes can improve performance
      but may increase memory usage and processing time per batch.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Batch Size to 50
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      eventBus->SetBatchSize(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Batch Size Based on Server Load
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      uint32 serverLoad = GetServerLoadFactor();

      uint32 batchSize = (serverLoad > 80) ? 25 : 100;

      eventBus->SetBatchSize(batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating bot spawn events to ensure
    proper batching behavior. The batch size setting is global for the event bus and
    affects all subsequent spawn operations until changed again.
  warnings: Setting an excessively large batch size may cause performance degradation
    due to memory allocation overhead or extended processing times for individual
    batches. Ensure that the chosen batch size aligns with available system resources
    and desired responsiveness.
