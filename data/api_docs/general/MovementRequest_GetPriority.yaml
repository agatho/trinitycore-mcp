api:
  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetPriority
  signature: PlayerBotMovementPriority MovementRequest::GetPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the movement priority level assigned to this movement request for
    player bot processing.
  description: The GetPriority method returns the PlayerBotMovementPriority enum value
    that indicates the relative importance of this movement request within the context
    of player bot AI behavior. This priority determines how quickly and in what order
    the movement request will be processed by the bot's movement system. Higher priority
    requests are typically executed before lower priority ones, affecting the bot's
    responsiveness to different types of movement actions such as pathfinding, combat
    movement, or idle wandering. The method is const and does not modify any internal
    state of the MovementRequest object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PlayerBotMovementPriority enum value representing the priority level
    of this movement request. Possible values typically include PRIORITY_LOW, PRIORITY_NORMAL,
    PRIORITY_HIGH, and possibly others depending on the implementation. The specific
    meaning of each priority level should be referenced in the PlayerBotMovementPriority
    documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Movement Priority
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nPlayerBotMovementPriority priority = request.GetPriority();\n\
      if (priority == PRIORITY_HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high-priority movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sorting Movement Requests by Priority
    code: "std::vector<MovementRequest> requests;\n// ... populate requests ...\n\
      std::sort(requests.begin(), requests.end(), [](const MovementRequest& a, const\
      \ MovementRequest& b)\n{\n    return a.GetPriority() > b.GetPriority(); // Sort\
      \ descending by priority\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not involve complex
    computations or external lookups. The priority value is typically set during the
    construction or initialization of the MovementRequest object, and this method
    simply retrieves that pre-computed value.
