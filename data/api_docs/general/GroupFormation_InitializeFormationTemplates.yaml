  signature: void GroupFormation::InitializeFormationTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes group formation templates for player groups in the game world.
  description: The InitializeFormationTemplates method sets up predefined formation
    configurations that define how player units should position themselves relative
    to each other within a group. This method is typically called during server initialization
    or when loading group-related data to ensure that all available formations are
    properly registered and ready for use. It establishes the base templates used
    by the group management system to maintain proper positioning during combat, movement,
    and other group activities. The method does not require any parameters and performs
    its operations internally using the TrinityCore's group formation subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: GroupFormation::InitializeFormationTemplates();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when necessary
    to reload formation data. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in the
    main thread context. The method internally loads predefined formations from configuration
    files or database entries, so any changes to these sources will be reflected after
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate formation entries. Ensure that no active groups are using formations
    when reloading templates to avoid unexpected positioning behavior.
