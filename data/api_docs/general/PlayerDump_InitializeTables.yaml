  brief: Initializes internal data structures and tables used for player dump operations
  description: The InitializeTables method prepares all necessary internal data structures
    and database tables required for player dump functionality. This method is typically
    called during system initialization or when preparing to process player data exports.
    It ensures that all required database schema elements are properly set up and
    ready for use. The method performs setup operations such as creating temporary
    tables, initializing lookup caches, and preparing data containers needed for subsequent
    player dump operations. This initialization is crucial for maintaining data integrity
    and performance during player data processing.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'PlayerDump dump;

      dump.InitializeTables();

      // Tables are now ready for player dump operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle,
    typically during server startup or when the PlayerDump subsystem is first instantiated.
    The initialization process may involve database schema checks and table creation
    if they don't already exist.
