  class: SocialMgr
  method: RemovePlayerSocial
  signature: void SocialMgr::RemovePlayerSocial(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player's social entries from the database and in-memory cache.
  description: The RemovePlayerSocial method removes all social relationships associated
    with a specified player GUID from both the database and the in-memory social manager
    cache. This includes friend lists, ignore lists, and any other social data for
    the player. The operation is typically invoked when a player character is deleted
    or when social data needs to be cleared for administrative purposes. The method
    ensures data consistency by removing entries from all relevant tables and updating
    internal caches accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose social entries
      are to be removed. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the database
      or character management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Social Data for a Player
    code: "void RemovePlayerSocialExample(uint32 playerGuid)\n{\n    sSocialMgr->RemovePlayerSocial(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // All social entries for the specified player are now removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and cache invalidation. It should
    be called with caution as it permanently removes social data. The operation is
    not transactional, so partial removals may occur if errors happen during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player GUID that does not exist in the social
    system will likely result in no-op behavior or potential database inconsistencies.
    Always validate the GUID before calling this method.
