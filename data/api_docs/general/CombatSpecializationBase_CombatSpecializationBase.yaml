  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: CombatSpecializationBase
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::CombatSpecializationBase(Player * bot,
    CombatRole role, ResourceType primaryResource)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new combat specialization instance for a player with specified
    role and primary resource type.
  description: The CombatSpecializationBase constructor initializes a combat specialization
    object for a given player, assigning them a specific combat role and defining
    their primary resource type. This method sets up the foundational attributes required
    for a bot's combat behavior in TrinityCore's AI system. The initialization process
    establishes how the bot will interact with game mechanics such as resource management,
    ability selection, and tactical decision-making based on their assigned role (e.g.,
    tank, healer, damage dealer) and primary resource (e.g., mana, energy, rage).
    This constructor is typically called during bot creation or specialization switching
    to configure the AI's combat behavior properly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use this
      combat specialization. Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will cause
      undefined behavior.
  - name: role
    description: The CombatRole enum value specifying the bot's primary combat role
      (tank, healer, or damage dealer). Determines tactical priorities and ability
      usage patterns.
  - name: primaryResource
    description: The ResourceType enum value indicating the bot's primary resource
      type (mana, energy, rage, etc.). Affects resource management strategies and
      ability selection logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      CombatRole role = CombatRole::DPS;

      ResourceType resource = ResourceType::MANA;

      CombatSpecializationBase spec(myBot, role, resource);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tank Specialization Setup
    code: 'Player* tankBot = ...; // Get reference to tank bot

      CombatSpecializationBase tankSpec(tankBot, CombatRole::TANK, ResourceType::RAGE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation on the input parameters.
    It's assumed that all inputs are valid and properly initialized. The method directly
    assigns values without additional processing or checks. This is a foundational
    constructor for AI combat behavior setup in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for 'bot' parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure all parameters are valid before calling this constructor to avoid crashes
    or memory corruption.
