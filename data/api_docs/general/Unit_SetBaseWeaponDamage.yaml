  class: Unit
  method: SetBaseWeaponDamage
  signature: void Unit::SetBaseWeaponDamage(int attType, WeaponDamageRange damageRange,
    float value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the base weapon damage for a specified attack type on the unit.
  description: This method configures the base weapon damage values for a given attack
    type (melee, ranged, or off-hand) on the Unit. It allows developers to modify
    the damage range and value associated with specific weapon attacks, which is essential
    for controlling combat mechanics in World of Warcraft. The method affects the
    unit's weapon damage output based on the specified attack type and damage range,
    enabling precise control over damage calculations during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: The attack type to set the weapon damage for. Valid values are 0
      (melee), 1 ( ranged), or 2 (off-hand).
  - name: damageRange
    description: The weapon damage range to set. This defines the minimum and maximum
      damage values for the specified attack type.
  - name: value
    description: The base damage value to set for the specified attack type and damage
      range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetBaseWeaponDamage(0, WeaponDamageRange::MIN_MAX, 10.0f);

      // Sets melee weapon damage to 10.0f for minimum/maximum range'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetBaseWeaponDamage(1, WeaponDamageRange::MIN_MAX, 25.5f);

      // Sets ranged weapon damage to 25.5f for minimum/maximum range

      // This affects the unit''s ranged attack damage calculation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly impacts combat calculations and should be used carefully
    when modifying unit behavior. The damage values are typically set during initialization
    or when adjusting unit stats, and may require additional updates to ensure proper
    weapon damage calculations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect damage calculations
    in combat. Care must be taken when setting weapon damage values to avoid affecting
    the unit's overall damage output. This method should not be used for modifying
    damage values during combat without proper consideration of game mechanics.
