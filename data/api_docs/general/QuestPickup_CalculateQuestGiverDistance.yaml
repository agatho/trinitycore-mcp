  class: QuestPickup
  method: CalculateQuestGiverDistance
  signature: float QuestPickup::CalculateQuestGiverDistance(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the distance between a bot player and a quest giver specified
    by GUID.
  description: The CalculateQuestGiverDistance method computes the Euclidean distance
    between the position of the provided bot player and the position of a quest giver
    identified by the given GUID. This utility function is typically used in AI behavior
    logic to determine proximity for quest-related actions such as quest acceptance,
    turn-in, or interaction. The method relies on the World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    engine's positioning system to accurately calculate spatial relationships between
    entities in the game world. It assumes that both the player and the quest giver
    are valid entities within the same map and instance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for which
      the distance is calculated.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity whose position
      is used in the distance calculation.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the distance in yards between the bot
    player and the quest giver. A return value of 0.0 indicates that the bot and quest
    giver are at the same location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check proximity
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nuint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nfloat distance =\
      \ QuestPickup::CalculateQuestGiverDistance(myBot, questGiverGuid);\nif (distance\
      \ < 5.0f) {\n    // Proceed with quest interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance for AI decision making
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 questGiverGuid = GetQuestGiverGuid();\nfloat\
      \ dist = QuestPickup::CalculateQuestGiverDistance(bot, questGiverGuid);\nif\
      \ (dist > 100.0f) {\n    // Move closer to quest giver\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0,\
      \ questGiverPosition);\n} else if (dist < 5.0f) {\n    // Interact with quest\
      \ giver\n    bot->QuestTellGiver();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct distance calculation using the 3D coordinates
    of both entities. It does not account for obstacles or terrain height differences
    in its computation, which may affect real-world navigation accuracy. The method
    requires that both the bot player and quest giver are active and exist within
    the same map instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid GameObject
    or Creature entity; otherwise, the result will be unpredictable. Also, calling
    this function when either the bot or quest giver is not in the same map instance
    may lead to incorrect distance calculations or potential crashes.
