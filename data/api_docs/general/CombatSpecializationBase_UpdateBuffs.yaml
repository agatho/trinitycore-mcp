documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs for the combat specialization
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buffs within the current combat specialization. This method typically iterates
    through the player's active buff list, evaluates their duration and effects, and
    ensures that any changes to buff states are properly propagated to the game client.
    It may also handle removal of expired buffs and application of new buff effects
    based on the specialization's unique mechanics. The method is commonly called
    during combat state transitions or when buff durations are updated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyCombatSystem::OnPlayerAttack()\n{\n    // Update all active buffs\
      \ before processing attack\n    player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with attack logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during appropriate game states where buff
    updates are valid. It may trigger client-side updates and should not be called
    excessively during high-frequency operations. The implementation likely involves
    iterating through a container of active buffs and calling individual update methods
    on each.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs outside of proper combat or gameplay contexts may
    cause unexpected behavior or client desynchronization. This method might be performance-sensitive
    when dealing with many active buffs, so avoid calling it in tight loops without
    proper throttling.
