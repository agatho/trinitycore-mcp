api:
  class: Guild
  method: SetBankTabText
  signature: void Guild::SetBankTabText(uint8 tabId, std::string_view text)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the text description for a specified guild bank tab.
  description: The SetBankTabText method updates the custom text label associated
    with a specific guild bank tab. This text is displayed in the guild bank interface
    to help members identify the purpose or contents of each tab. The method takes
    a tab identifier and a string view containing the new text. It's typically used
    by guild leaders or officers when organizing their guild's bank resources. The
    change is applied immediately and persisted in the database. There are no explicit
    preconditions, but the tabId must be valid (0-9) for standard WoW guild banks.
  parameters:
  - name: tabId
    description: The index of the bank tab to modify. Valid values range from 0 to
      9, representing the first through tenth tabs in a typical guild bank configuration.
  - name: text
    description: A string view containing the new text label for the bank tab. This
      can be up to 128 characters long and supports all printable Unicode characters.
      An empty string will clear the tab's text.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bank Tab Text to 'Weapons'
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SetBankTabText(0,\
      \ \"Weapons\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Bank Tab Text
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SetBankTabText(3,\
      \ \"\"); // Clear the text for tab 3\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the guild's bank tab data and will trigger
    a database update. The text is stored in the guild_bank_tab table within the database.
    It's recommended to validate that the player has sufficient permissions (guild
    leader or officer) before calling this method, as unauthorized modifications may
    be rejected by the server.
  warnings: Passing an invalid tabId (outside of 0-9 range) may lead to undefined
    behavior or silent failure. Ensure that the text parameter does not exceed the
    maximum allowed length (typically 128 characters) to avoid truncation or errors.
