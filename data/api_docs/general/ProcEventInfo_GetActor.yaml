documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the actor's unique identifier (GUID) involved in the
    proc event
  description: The GetActor method retrieves a pointer to the integer representation
    of the GUID associated with the actor who triggered the proc event. This is commonly
    used in spell and ability trigger conditions where the system needs to identify
    which unit or player initiated the event. The returned pointer points to an internal
    data member of the ProcEventInfo object, so it should not be modified directly.
    The method is typically called within event handlers or trigger conditions to
    access information about the entity that caused a proc to occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the actor involved in
    the proc event. This value can be used to identify the specific unit or player
    that triggered the proc, which is essential for determining eligibility, applying
    effects, or checking conditions based on the actor's properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a spell trigger
    code: "void MySpell::HandleProc(ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n    int* actorGUID\
      \ = eventInfo.GetActor();\n    if (actorGUID && *actorGUID != 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Process the proc based on the actor\n        Unit* actor = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*actorGUID);\n\
      \        // ... perform actions based on actor\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if actor is a player
    code: "void MyAbility::OnProc(ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n    int* actorGUID\
      \ = eventInfo.GetActor();\n    if (actorGUID && *actorGUID != 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      Player* player = ObjectAccessor::GetPlayer(*actorGUID);\n        if (player)\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply special effects for player triggers\n     \
      \       player->AddItem(ITEM_ID, 1);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the ProcEventInfo
    object. Do not store this pointer for later use as it may become invalid. The
    method returns a pointer to an internal member, so modifying the value through
    this pointer will affect the ProcEventInfo's internal state.
  warnings: Never modify the value pointed to by the returned pointer as it directly
    affects the internal state of the ProcEventInfo object. Be sure to check for null
    or zero values before dereferencing the pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
