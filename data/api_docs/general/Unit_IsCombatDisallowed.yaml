documentation:
  brief: Determines whether combat is disallowed for the unit
  description: This method checks if combat is currently disallowed for the specified
    unit, typically used to prevent engagement with targets or to determine if a unit
    can enter combat. The method returns true when combat is disallowed, indicating
    that the unit cannot engage in combat behavior. This is commonly used in game
    mechanics to enforce rules such as preventing players from entering combat during
    certain events or states, like being in a stealth state or during specific quest
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if combat is disallowed for the unit, otherwise false. This
    indicates that the unit cannot enter combat or engage targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsCombatDisallowed()) {\n    // Do something when combat is disallowed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal flags or states
    within the unit''s combat system. Performance considerations: This method should
    be lightweight as it''s often used in frequent checks during combat logic. Thread
    safety: This method is generally safe to use in multi-threaded environments as
    it doesn''t modify any state.'
  warnings: 'This method may not always reflect the actual combat state, as some game
    mechanics may override or temporarily disable combat disallowance. Common mistake:
    Using this method without understanding its implications for combat behavior can
    lead to incorrect logic in combat systems.'
