  brief: Initializes combat movement triggers for AI behavior
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up the trigger conditions that govern
    how an AI-controlled unit moves during combat situations. This method configures
    the various events and states that will activate specific movement behaviors,
    such as approaching enemies, retreating when health is low, or maintaining distance
    from targets. It establishes the foundation for dynamic combat movement decisions
    by defining the conditions under which different movement strategies should be
    executed. The method typically runs once during AI initialization to set up all
    necessary trigger relationships.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Initialization
    code: 'CombatMovementStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now configured for combat movement behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during AI initialization. It typically
    sets up internal trigger mappings and does not require any external parameters.
    The actual trigger execution occurs later during the AI update cycle when conditions
    are met.
