    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the waypoint movement generator is currently following
    the path in reverse order from end to start.
  description: This method checks the internal state of a WaypointMovementGenerator
    to determine if it is currently moving along the waypoints in reverse order, starting
    from the last waypoint and proceeding back to the first. This behavior typically
    occurs when the movement generator has completed a forward traversal of the path
    and is now reversing direction, often used for looping or ping-pong movement patterns.
    The method returns true if the path is being traversed backwards; otherwise, it
    returns false. This functionality is commonly used in AI-controlled creatures
    that need to move along predefined waypoints in a specific sequence, such as patrol
    guards or scripted events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the waypoint movement generator is currently
    following the path in reverse order from end to start. Returns true if the path
    is being traversed backwards, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Movement is Reversing
    code: "if (movementGenerator->IsFollowingPathBackwardsFromEndToStart()) {\n  \
      \  // Handle reverse movement logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature is moving\
      \ backwards along waypoints\");\n} else {\n    // Handle normal forward movement\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Creature is moving forwards along waypoints\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the WaypointMovementGenerator
    class. The actual reversal behavior depends on how the path looping or ping-pong
    logic is configured in the movement generator's setup. It is important to note
    that this check should be performed during active movement execution, as the return
    value may change dynamically during runtime.
  warnings: This method only reflects the current traversal direction and does not
    indicate whether a reversal is about to occur or has just occurred. Developers
    should ensure they are checking this flag at appropriate times in the movement
    cycle to avoid race conditions or incorrect assumptions about movement state.
