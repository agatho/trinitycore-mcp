documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GameObjectScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GameObjectScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, GameObjectScript serves
    as a base class for custom game object behaviors. When an instance of a derived
    GameObjectScript class is destroyed, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of
    internal data structures and prevents memory leaks. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it
    an essential part of the class's resource management strategy.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GameObjectScript instance
    code: "class MyGameObjectScript : public GameObjectScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGameObjectScript()\
      \ {}\n    ~MyGameObjectScript() override {}\n};\n\nvoid ExampleFunction()\n\
      {\n    MyGameObjectScript* script = new MyGameObjectScript();\n    // ... use\
      \ the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GameObjectScript destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime. It's typically invoked by the game engine during cleanup
    operations or when objects are removed from memory. Developers should ensure that
    derived classes properly implement their own destructors if they allocate resources
    that need explicit cleanup.
