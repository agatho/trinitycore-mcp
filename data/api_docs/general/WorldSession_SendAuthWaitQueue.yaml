  signature: void WorldSession::SendAuthWaitQueue(uint32 position)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an authentication wait queue position message to the client.
  description: The SendAuthWaitQueue method is used to communicate the player's position
    in the authentication queue to the connected client. This method is typically
    invoked when a player attempts to log in but must wait due to server capacity
    or authentication system limitations. The client uses this information to display
    a waiting screen with the estimated time until login can proceed. The method sends
    a specific packet containing the queue position number, allowing the UI to update
    accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Login Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    WorldSession* session =\
      \ player->GetSession();\n    if (IsAuthenticationQueueFull())\n    {\n     \
      \   uint32 queuePosition = GetPlayerQueuePosition(player);\n        session->SendAuthWaitQueue(queuePosition);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a player is actually in the authentication
    queue. The position parameter represents the player's place in line, where 1 indicates
    they are next to be authenticated. It is important that this method is not called
    repeatedly without updating the position value, as it may cause client-side UI
    flickering or incorrect queue status display.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of authentication context can lead to client-side
    errors or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the position value passed is valid
    and represents a realistic queue position (typically starting from 1). Do not
    call this method if the player has already been authenticated or if they are already
    in the world.
