documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can execute triggers on hit.
  description: This method checks if a spell is capable of executing trigger effects
    when it hits a target. It evaluates the spell's properties and conditions to determine
    if trigger mechanisms should be activated during the execution of the spell. The
    method is typically used in spell processing logic to control whether certain
    trigger effects are applied when a spell connects with its target, particularly
    in cases where the spell may have specific trigger conditions or when dealing
    with aura-based triggers that require special handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can execute triggers on hit, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the spell does not meet the required conditions
    for trigger execution or when trigger mechanisms are disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool result = spell->CanExecuteTriggersOnHit(unit, triggeredByAura);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Execute trigger logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell execution logic and typically used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods. It may be called during spell processing or
    when handling aura effects, particularly for spells that have trigger conditions.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this method does not involve complex
    computations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    spell execution methods, as incorrect usage can lead to unexpected behavior in
    trigger execution. This method should only be used when the spell has specific
    trigger conditions or when dealing with aura-based triggers that require special
    handling.
