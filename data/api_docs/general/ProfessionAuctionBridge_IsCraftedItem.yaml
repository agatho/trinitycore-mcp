  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: IsCraftedItem
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::IsCraftedItem(uint32 itemId, ProfessionType
    & outProfession) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified item is a crafted profession item and retrieves
    its associated profession type.
  description: The IsCraftedItem method checks if a given item ID corresponds to an
    item that was created through a crafting profession. It returns true if the item
    is a crafted profession item, and false otherwise. When the item is crafted, the
    method also populates the output parameter 'outProfession' with the type of profession
    associated with the crafting process. This functionality is essential for auction
    house systems and crafting-related game mechanics to distinguish between crafted
    items and other types of items. The method relies on internal mappings of item
    IDs to profession types within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to check. This should correspond
      to an entry in the game's item database.
  - name: outProfession
    description: Reference to a ProfessionType variable that will be populated with
      the profession type if the item is crafted. If the item is not crafted, this
      value remains unchanged.
  returns: True if the specified item ID corresponds to a crafted profession item;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ProfessionType profession;\nif (bridge.IsCraftedItem(12345, profession))\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Item is crafted by: \" << profession << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Item is not a crafted profession item.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Logic
    code: "uint32 itemId = 67890;\nProfessionType profession;\nif (bridge.IsCraftedItem(itemId,\
      \ profession)) {\n    // Process crafted item for auction\n    AuctionHouseMgr::AddCraftedItem(itemId,\
      \ profession);\n} else {\n    // Handle regular item\n    AuctionHouseMgr::AddRegularItem(itemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caches or lookups to map item IDs to profession
    types. It may be called frequently during auction house operations, so performance
    is important. The method does not validate the existence of the itemId in the
    database; it assumes valid input.
  warnings: Do not assume that a returned ProfessionType value is valid unless the
    method returns true. If the method returns false, the outProfession parameter
    should not be used as it may contain garbage data. Ensure that the item ID passed
    is valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
