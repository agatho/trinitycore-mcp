  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteInterrupt(BotAI * ai, const
    InterruptContext & interruptContext)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current spell cast by the bot AI and returns the result of
    the interruption action.
  description: The ExecuteInterrupt method is responsible for handling the interruption
    of an ongoing spell cast within the context of a bot AI. It evaluates whether
    the current spell can be interrupted based on the provided interrupt context,
    which typically includes information about the spell being cast, the caster's
    state, and potential interrupt triggers such as damage or movement. This method
    is crucial in bot AI behavior to ensure that spells are properly managed during
    combat or other dynamic situations where interruption may be necessary for tactical
    reasons. The method returns an ActionResult indicating success or failure of the
    interruption attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and spell
      casting logic.
  - name: interruptContext
    description: Reference to an InterruptContext object containing details about
      the spell being interrupted, including spell ID, caster state, and interrupt
      conditions.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating whether the interruption was successful
    or failed. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes
    depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Usage
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nInterruptContext context;\ncontext.spellId\
      \ = 12345;\ncontext.casterState = CAST_STATE_CASTING;\nActionResult result =\
      \ interruptAction.ExecuteInterrupt(botAI, context);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Spell interrupted successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt with Conditional Logic
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nInterruptContext context;\ncontext.spellId\
      \ = 12345;\ncontext.casterState = CAST_STATE_CASTING;\ncontext.damageTaken =\
      \ 50;\nActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecuteInterrupt(botAI, context);\n\
      switch (result) {\n    case ActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Handle successful\
      \ interruption\n        break;\n    case ActionResult::FAILED:\n        // Handle\
      \ failed interruption attempt\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle\
      \ other cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat or high-priority AI decision-making
    scenarios. It assumes that the BotAI instance and InterruptContext are properly
    initialized before calling. The behavior of this method may vary depending on
    the specific spell being interrupted and the current state of the bot.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the InterruptContext can lead to undefined
    behavior or failed interruption attempts. Ensure that all required fields in the
    context are populated before invoking this method.
