  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: SetMaxConcurrentQuests
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(uint32 botGuid, uint32
    maxQuests)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of concurrent quests allowed for a specific bot character.
  description: The SetMaxConcurrentQuests method configures the dynamic quest system
    to limit how many quests a bot character can have active at the same time. This
    is useful for managing quest load and ensuring that bots do not overwhelm the
    game's quest tracking system or cause performance issues. The method takes a bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) and the maximum number of concurrent quests allowed.
    It updates internal tracking structures to enforce this limit when new quests
    are assigned to the bot. This functionality is typically used in automated questing
    systems or AI-driven characters within TrinityCore-based servers.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which the concurrent
      quest limit is being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: maxQuests
    description: The maximum number of quests that can be active concurrently for
      the specified bot. Must be a positive integer value representing the desired
      limit (e.g., 1, 3, 5).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Max Concurrent Quests for a Bot
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(12345, 3);

      // This sets the maximum concurrent quests for bot with GUID 12345 to 3.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Quest Limit Based on Bot Type
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint32 maxQuests = (player->GetLevel() > 60) ? 5 : 3;

      DynamicQuestSystem::SetMaxConcurrentQuests(botGuid, maxQuests);

      // Adjusts concurrent quest limit based on bot''s level.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state within the DynamicQuestSystem class and
    should be called before assigning quests to ensure proper enforcement. The system
    may internally validate that maxQuests is within acceptable bounds (e.g., not
    zero or excessively high). This function does not directly affect quest completion
    or progression, only the number of concurrent active quests.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid may result in undefined behavior
    or errors if the GUID does not correspond to a valid player in the database. Ensure
    that maxQuests is a reasonable value to avoid performance degradation or quest
    system instability.
