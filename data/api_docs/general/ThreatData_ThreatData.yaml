documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ThreatData class with default values.
  description: The ThreatData constructor initializes a new instance of the ThreatData
    class, setting up internal data structures and default threat values for creature
    or player threat management. This method is typically invoked when creating new
    threat entries within the AI system to track unit aggro levels. The constructor
    ensures that all internal state variables are properly initialized to their default
    values, including threat amounts, target references, and time-based tracking elements.
    It plays a crucial role in the overall threat management system of NPCs and players
    within TrinityCore's combat mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ThreatData instance
    code: 'ThreatData* threatData = new ThreatData();

      // Initializes default threat values for a new creature or player threat entry'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when creating new ThreatData objects.
    It's important to note that the class likely manages memory and internal references,
    so proper object lifecycle management should be observed. The initialization process
    may involve setting up internal linked lists or hash tables for efficient threat
    tracking.
