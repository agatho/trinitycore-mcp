  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateWedgeFormation(uint32 memberCount, float
    spacing) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a wedge formation for a group of units with specified spacing.
  description: The GenerateWedgeFormation method calculates and applies a wedge-shaped
    formation for a group of units, typically used in group movement or combat positioning.
    It positions members in a triangular pattern with the lead unit at the apex, creating
    an effective formation for advancing or flanking. The method takes into account
    the number of members and spacing between them to determine optimal placement.
    This formation is commonly utilized in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for managing
    group behavior during player versus environment encounters or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of units that will participate in the wedge formation.
      Must be a positive integer representing valid group members.
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance between individual units in the formation. Should be
      a positive floating-point value defining the separation between adjacent members.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating success or failure of the operation. A return
    value of 0 typically indicates successful formation generation, while negative
    values may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient group members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic wedge formation generation
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nint result = formation.GenerateWedgeFormation(5,\
      \ 2.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Formation successfully created\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error handling
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nuint32 members = 7;\nfloat spacing = 1.5f;\n\
      int status = formation.GenerateWedgeFormation(members, spacing);\nif (status\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"group\", \"Failed to generate\
      \ wedge formation with {} members and spacing {}\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with group movement or combat positioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI-driven group behavior systems within
    TrinityCore. The actual positioning logic may vary based on unit types and environmental
    constraints. Performance is generally efficient for small to medium-sized groups,
    but large formations might require additional optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that memberCount is greater than zero to avoid undefined behavior.
    The spacing parameter should be carefully chosen to prevent units from overlapping
    or becoming too spread out, which could affect gameplay balance.
