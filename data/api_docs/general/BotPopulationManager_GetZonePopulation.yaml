api:
  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: GetZonePopulation
  signature: ZonePopulation BotPopulationManager::GetZonePopulation(uint32 zoneId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the population data for a specified zone in the game world.
  description: The GetZonePopulation method retrieves the current population statistics
    for a given zone identified by its unique zone ID. This includes information about
    the number of players, creatures, and other entities present in that zone. The
    returned ZonePopulation object encapsulates this data, allowing scripts or systems
    to make decisions based on zone congestion or activity levels. This functionality
    is particularly useful for AI-driven bots or dynamic world management systems
    that need to adapt behavior based on real-time population data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ZonePopulation object containing detailed statistics about the specified
    zone's current population, including player count, creature count, and potentially
    other relevant metrics. Returns an empty or default-initialized ZonePopulation
    if the zone ID is invalid or no population data is available for that zone.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Population Data for a Specific Zone
    code: "ZonePopulation pop = botMgr->GetZonePopulation(1337);\nif (pop.GetPlayerCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Zone is populated, take action\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"\
      Zone 1337 has {} players.\", pop.GetPlayerCount());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or real-time data from the game world's
    internal population tracking systems. It may involve database queries or in-memory
    lookups depending on how the BotPopulationManager is implemented. The returned
    ZonePopulation object should be treated as immutable for the duration of its use
    to avoid inconsistencies.
  warnings: Ensure that zoneId values are validated before calling this method, as
    invalid IDs might result in undefined behavior or incorrect population data. This
    method may not be thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
