  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: StartBossFight
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::StartBossFight(Creature * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a boss fight sequence for the specified creature within the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
  description: The StartBossFight method is responsible for triggering the beginning
    of a boss encounter in TrinityCore's AI system. It initializes the necessary behavior
    states and event handlers required for managing a boss fight, including setting
    up combat readiness, activating specific AI behaviors, and preparing the environment
    for player engagement. This method typically expects a valid Creature pointer
    representing the boss entity that will be engaged in combat. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal AI state to reflect the start of the boss
    encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: A pointer to the Creature object representing the boss that will
      begin the fight. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid
      creature with appropriate AI behavior configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Fight Initiation
    code: "void OnCreatureEnterCombat(Creature* boss)\n{\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->StartBossFight(boss);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Fight with Precondition Check
    code: "void TriggerBossFight(Creature* boss)\n{\n    if (boss && boss->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->StartBossFight(boss);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Creature object has already been initialized
    with proper AI scripts and behaviors. It may internally call other manager methods
    to set up encounter-specific variables, such as health thresholds, phase transitions,
    or event triggers. The method is typically invoked during creature combat entry
    or when a specific trigger condition is met in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the boss parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally,
    this method should only be called when the boss is ready for combat and has been
    properly spawned in the world.
