  brief: Updates area-dependent auras for all players in the world
  description: The UpdateAreaDependentAuras method iterates through all active players
    in the world and evaluates their current area-based aura states. This method is
    responsible for managing auras that have area restrictions, such as those tied
    to zones, instances, or specific geographical regions. It ensures that players
    receive appropriate aura effects based on their location and that any area-dependent
    aura effects are properly applied or removed as players move between different
    areas. The method typically runs during world updates to maintain consistent game
    state for area-based mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in World Update Loop
    code: "void World::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    UpdateAreaDependentAuras();\n\
      \    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the world's main update cycle and
    may have performance implications if there are many players active in the world.
    It's important to note that this method only handles area-dependent auras, not
    all aura types. The implementation likely uses spatial partitioning or similar
    optimization techniques to efficiently determine which players need aura updates.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of the main world update loop
    as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent state. It's also important to
    understand that this method only affects area-dependent auras, so other aura types
    will not be processed here.
