documentation:
  brief: Initializes and activates the solo AI strategy for a bot character
  description: The OnActivate method is called when a SoloStrategy becomes active
    for a bot AI instance. This method sets up the necessary internal state and configuration
    required for the solo strategy to function properly. It typically initializes
    behavior patterns, action priorities, and any strategy-specific variables that
    are needed during the bot's operation. The method ensures that the AI is ready
    to execute solo gameplay behaviors such as targeting, movement, and combat decisions
    without interference from other strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this strategy is being activated
      for. This parameter provides access to the bot's current state, target information,
      and AI context needed for strategy execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activating Solo Strategy
    code: "void ActivateSoloStrategy(BotAI* ai)\n{\n    SoloStrategy strategy;\n \
      \   strategy.OnActivate(ai);\n    // Bot AI is now using solo strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per strategy activation cycle. It's
    typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore AI system when switching strategies,
    but can also be manually triggered during custom bot behavior implementation.
