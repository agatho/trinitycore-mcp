documentation:
  brief: Returns the next used position in the selector's list of occupied positions.
  description: The nextUsedPos method retrieves the next available entry from the
    internal list of used positions within an ObjectPosSelector. This selector is
    typically used during object placement calculations, such as when spawning creatures
    or game objects in a specific area, ensuring that new placements do not overlap
    with existing ones. The method advances an internal iterator and returns a pointer
    to the current element in the list. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    positioning methods like nextPossiblePos to determine valid spawn locations for
    entities in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a UsedPosList::value_type representing the next used position
    in the selector's internal list, or nullptr if no more positions are available.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through Used Positions
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\n// Assume some positions have been added to\
      \ selector\nconst ObjectPosSelector::UsedPosList::value_type* pos = selector.nextUsedPos();\n\
      while (pos != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the position\n    pos = selector.nextUsedPos();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies an internal iterator state, so calling it multiple times
    without resetting or checking for null will advance through the list sequentially.
    The returned pointer is valid only until the next call to any method on the ObjectPosSelector.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned value is always valid; always check for
    nullptr before dereferencing the pointer. Also, calling this method repeatedly
    without proper iteration control may lead to undefined behavior or skipping elements.
