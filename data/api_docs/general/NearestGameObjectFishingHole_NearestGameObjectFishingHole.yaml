  signature: void NearestGameObjectFishingHole::NearestGameObjectFishingHole(const
    NearestGameObjectFishingHole & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest fishing hole game object within the player's
    current area.
  description: The NearestGameObjectFishingHole method is used to locate the closest
    fishing hole (game object of type FISHING_HOLE) in the vicinity of the player.
    This method is typically invoked during fishing mechanics to determine where a
    player can cast their line. It searches through nearby game objects and returns
    the one that matches the fishing hole criteria, considering distance and validity.
    The result is often used by the fishing system to set up the fishing state and
    determine valid fishing locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a fishing context
    code: "void Player::HandleFishingAttempt()\n{\n    NearestGameObjectFishingHole\
      \ fishingHole;\n    fishingHole.NearestGameObjectFishingHole(*this);\n    //\
      \ Proceed with fishing logic using the found fishing hole\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's internal AI and game object interaction
    system. It relies on the underlying GameObject system to identify valid fishing
    holes based on their type and position relative to the player. Performance is
    optimized through spatial indexing, but frequent calls may impact server performance
    in high-density areas.
  warnings: The method assumes that the calling context has a valid player instance
    with a current location. If no valid fishing hole exists within range, behavior
    may vary depending on implementation; it might return an invalid or null reference,
    potentially causing crashes if not handled properly.
