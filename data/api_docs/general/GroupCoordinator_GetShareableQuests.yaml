  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetShareableQuests
  signature: int GroupCoordinator::GetShareableQuests() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of shareable quests available in the group coordinator's
    context
  description: The GetShareableQuests method returns an integer value representing
    the count of quests that can be shared among group members within the GroupCoordinator's
    scope. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to determine how many quests are eligible for group sharing, which affects quest
    progression and reward distribution. The returned value indicates the total number
    of quests that meet the criteria for sharing, such as those with specific quest
    flags or group-sharing permissions. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper quest synchronization between players in a group.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of shareable quests available. A return
    value of 0 indicates no shareable quests exist, while positive values indicate
    the count of quests eligible for group sharing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordinator();\n\
      int shareableQuestCount = coordinator->GetShareableQuests();\nif (shareableQuestCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process shareable quests\n    printf(\"Found %d shareable\
      \ quests\\n\", shareableQuestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through the group's active quests and filters
    them based on sharing criteria. The implementation may involve checking quest
    flags, group member requirements, or other conditions that determine if a quest
    can be shared among group members.
