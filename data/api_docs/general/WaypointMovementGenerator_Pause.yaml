  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: Pause
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::Pause(uint32 timer)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses the waypoint movement generator for a specified duration.
  description: The Pause method temporarily halts the execution of a waypoint movement
    generator for a given time interval. This functionality is commonly used in AI
    behavior scripting to introduce delays between movement waypoints, allowing for
    more natural or scripted movement patterns. The timer parameter specifies how
    long (in milliseconds) the movement should be paused before resuming. During the
    pause period, the associated unit will remain stationary and not progress through
    its waypoint path.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The duration in milliseconds to pause the waypoint movement. Valid
      values are positive integers representing time intervals.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pause Usage
    code: 'WaypointMovementGenerator* movementGen = new WaypointMovementGenerator();

      movementGen->Pause(3000); // Pauses for 3 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pause with Dynamic Timer
    code: 'uint32 delay = 1000 + (rand() % 2000); // Random delay between 1-3 seconds

      movementGen->Pause(delay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Pause method modifies internal state flags to track the pause duration.
    It's important to ensure that the timer value is reasonable and doesn't cause
    unexpected behavior in movement timing. The method does not block execution but
    rather schedules a resume event based on the provided timer.
  warnings: Calling Pause with a very large timer value may cause unintended delays
    in AI behavior. Ensure that pause durations are appropriate for the intended game
    mechanics to avoid disrupting gameplay flow or causing performance issues.
