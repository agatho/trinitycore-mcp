documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Brewmaster Shuffle tracker requires a refresh of its
    internal state.
  description: The NeedsRefresh method evaluates the current state of the BrewmasterShuffleTracker
    to determine if it needs to update or recompute its tracking data. This typically
    occurs when certain conditions or events have changed that affect the accuracy
    or validity of the stored information. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with game mechanics related to the Brewmaster class's Shuffle ability, ensuring
    that the tracker reflects the most up-to-date status of the player's abilities
    and cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BrewmasterShuffleTracker's internal state is outdated
    and requires a refresh; otherwise returns false.

    code: "if (tracker.NeedsRefresh()) {\n    tracker.Refresh();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Cooldown Handling
    code: "void HandleShuffleAbility(Player* player) {\n    BrewmasterShuffleTracker&\
      \ tracker = player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker();\n    if (tracker.NeedsRefresh())\
      \ {\n        tracker.Refresh();\n        // Apply updated shuffle effects\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during gameplay to ensure that
    the Brewmaster's Shuffle tracking remains accurate. It may involve checking cooldown
    timers, buff/debuff states, or other dynamic properties of the player's character.
