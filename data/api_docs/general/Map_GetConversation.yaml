  class: Map
  method: GetConversation
  signature: int * Map::GetConversation(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the conversation associated with a given GUID from the map.
  description: The GetConversation method retrieves the conversation identifier (GUID)
    associated with a specific object within the map. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access conversation data for NPCs
    or objects that have conversations assigned. The method returns an integer pointer
    representing the conversation GUID, which can be used to determine the conversation
    state and related information. It operates on the principle that each object in
    the game world has a unique identifier that maps to its conversation data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the object for which to retrieve
      the conversation. This parameter represents a valid GUID from the game world,
      typically used to identify NPCs or objects with associated conversations.
  returns: The method returns an integer pointer representing the conversation GUID
    associated with the given object. If no conversation is found or if the object
    does not have a conversation assigned, it may return nullptr or 0, indicating
    no conversation exists for that object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Retrieval
    code: "int* conversation = map->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conversation != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Process conversation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to retrieve and manage conversation data. It may involve lookup operations that
    could impact performance if used frequently. The method should be thread-safe
    when used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return nullptr or
    zero values if no conversation is assigned to the object. Incorrect handling of
    returned pointers can lead to memory access violations or undefined behavior.
