  method: SendCriteriaUpdate
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendCriteriaUpdate(const Criteria * entry,
    const CriteriaProgress * progress, int timeElapsed, bool timedCompleted) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends criteria update information to guild members for achievement tracking.
  description: The SendCriteriaUpdate method is responsible for broadcasting progress
    updates related to guild achievements. It notifies all connected guild members
    about changes in criteria completion status, including time-based progress and
    completion flags. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronized
    achievement data across the guild's members and ensures that players receive real-time
    feedback on their progress toward guild-specific accomplishments.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to the Criteria structure containing information about the
      achievement criteria being updated. This parameter defines what specific criterion
      is progressing.
  - name: progress
    description: Pointer to the CriteriaProgress structure that holds current progress
      data for the specified criteria. Contains details like completion status, counter
      values, and timestamps.
  - name: timeElapsed
    description: Integer value representing time elapsed in seconds since the criteria
      started or last updated. Used for timed achievements and progress tracking.
  - name: timedCompleted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether a time-based criteria has been completed.
      True when time-based achievement is finished, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Criteria Update
    code: "void SendCriteriaUpdate(const Criteria* entry, const CriteriaProgress*\
      \ progress, int timeElapsed, bool timedCompleted) const {\n    // Implementation\
      \ would broadcast progress to guild members\n    // This is a simplified example\
      \ showing how the method might be invoked\n    GuildAchievementMgr* mgr = sGuildMgr->GetGuildAchievementMgr();\n\
      \    if (mgr)\n        mgr->SendCriteriaUpdate(entry, progress, timeElapsed,\
      \ timedCompleted);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the achievement system when
    a guild member makes progress on an achievement. The actual network communication
    and player notification occurs through TrinityCore's packet handling system. Developers
    should ensure that both entry and progress parameters are valid before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers for entry or progress
    may cause undefined behavior. Ensure all parameters are properly initialized and
    validated before invoking the method.
