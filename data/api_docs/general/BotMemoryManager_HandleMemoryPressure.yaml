documentation:
  brief: Manages memory pressure within the bot system by cleaning up unused resources
    and optimizing memory usage.
  description: The HandleMemoryPressure method is responsible for managing memory
    consumption in the TrinityCore bot system. It performs cleanup operations to free
    up unused memory, optimize resource allocation, and prevent memory leaks that
    could occur during extended bot operation. This method typically gets invoked
    automatically when memory pressure thresholds are exceeded or on a scheduled basis
    to maintain optimal performance. The method ensures that bots do not consume excessive
    memory over time, which is crucial for server stability and performance, especially
    in environments with many active bots.

  - title: Automatic Memory Management
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    // Called periodically by the bot system\n    m_memoryManager.HandleMemoryPressure();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot management system and
    should not be invoked manually unless specifically required. It may perform operations
    that temporarily affect performance during execution, such as iterating through
    active bots to identify and clean up unused resources.
