  class: Unit
  method: SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile
  signature: void Unit::SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(bool interactionAllowed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether interaction is allowed while hostiles are active.
  description: This method controls whether a Unit can engage in interactions such
    as talking, questing, or trading with players while in a hostile state. It typically
    affects the behavior of NPCs or players when they are in combat or have hostile
    relationships with other units. The method allows developers to configure interaction
    settings for different game scenarios and player states.
  parameters:
  - name: interactionAllowed
    description: A boolean value indicating whether interaction should be allowed
      while hostiles are active. True enables interaction, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(false);

      // This prevents interaction during hostile state

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal flags or states
    within the Unit class that control interaction behavior. Performance considerations:
    Setting this flag may affect how often certain interactions are processed, particularly
    in high-frequency scenarios like player vs player combat. Thread safety: The method
    should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments, but developers should
    ensure proper synchronization when modifying flags.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this method without understanding the implications
    of hostiles and interaction can lead to unexpected behavior during combat or questing.
    Dangerous edge cases: Setting interactionAllowed to false while a unit is actively
    hostile may cause issues with quest progression or NPC dialogue if not properly
    handled by the game logic.'
