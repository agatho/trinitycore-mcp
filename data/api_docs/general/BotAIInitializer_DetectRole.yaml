documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the role assigned to a bot AI based on its configuration
    and current state.
  description: The DetectRole method analyzes the internal configuration and contextual
    data of a BotAIInitializer instance to determine the appropriate role for the
    bot AI. This role typically defines the bot's primary function within the game,
    such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The method evaluates various factors including
    the bot's class, specialization, gear, and any assigned behavior flags to make
    this determination. It is commonly used during bot initialization or when reconfiguring
    a bot's behavior dynamically. This method does not modify any internal state but
    rather provides a read-only assessment of the bot's role.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a value of type BotAIConfig::Role, which represents the detected
    role for the bot AI. Possible values may include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER,
    or other specialized roles defined in the BotAIConfig enum. The method will always
    return a valid role, though the specific role returned depends on the bot's configuration
    and context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      BotAIConfig::Role role = initializer.DetectRole();

      // ''role'' now contains the determined role for this bot AI instance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Behavior Assignment
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nif (initializer.DetectRole() == BotAIConfig::Role::TANK)\
      \ {\n    // Apply tank-specific behavior logic\n}\nelse if (initializer.DetectRole()\
      \ == BotAIConfig::Role::HEALER) {\n    // Apply healer-specific behavior logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot
    AI to assign appropriate behaviors and strategies. The role detection process
    may involve evaluating multiple criteria such as class, talent trees, equipped
    items, and player preferences. It is recommended to cache the result if the role
    is used frequently to avoid repeated evaluations.
  warnings: The method assumes that all necessary configuration data has been properly
    initialized before calling. If called on an uninitialized or improperly configured
    BotAIInitializer instance, the returned role may be undefined or default to an
    unexpected value.
