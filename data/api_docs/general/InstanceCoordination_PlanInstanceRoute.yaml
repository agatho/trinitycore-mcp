  signature: void InstanceCoordination::PlanInstanceRoute(Group * group, const int
    & objectiveIds)
documentation:
  brief: Plans an instance route for a group based on specified objective IDs.
  description: The PlanInstanceRoute method orchestrates the routing and coordination
    of a player group's progression through a dungeon or raid instance. It takes a
    Group object and a list of objective identifiers to determine the optimal path
    for completing objectives within the instance. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with instance scripting and quest management systems to ensure proper
    group behavior during content traversal. The method does not directly execute
    movement but prepares the internal state required for route planning and coordination
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group that will
      traverse the instance. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: objectiveIds
    description: Reference to an integer containing objective identifiers that define
      the sequence or targets for the group's instance route. These IDs correspond
      to specific objectives within the instance content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Instance Route Planning
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int objectives[] = {1024, 1025, 1026};

      InstanceCoordination::PlanInstanceRoute(myGroup, objectives[0]);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and relies on internal
    state management for group synchronization. It should be called when a group enters
    an instance with specific objectives that require coordinated traversal.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Objective IDs must correspond to existing objectives in the instance content
    or behavior may be undefined.
