documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another GroupMgr instance to this instance
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the GroupMgr
    class, transferring all resources and state from the source GroupMgr object to
    the current object. This is typically used when reassigning one GroupMgr instance
    to another, efficiently transferring ownership of internal data structures without
    unnecessary copying. The operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified
    state. In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this method allows
    for efficient reallocation of group-related resources when managing player groups
    and their associated data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current GroupMgr instance after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'GroupMgr sourceGroup;

      // ... populate sourceGroup ...

      GroupMgr targetGroup = std::move(sourceGroup); // Uses operator=

      // sourceGroup is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment in Function Context
    code: "GroupMgr CreateAndAssignGroup()\n{\n    GroupMgr newGroup;\n    // ...\
      \ initialize group ...\n    return newGroup; // Move semantics used in return\n\
      }\n\nGroupMgr manager = CreateAndAssignGroup(); // operator= invoked here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is crucial for performance when
    dealing with large data structures like group managers. The move operation typically
    involves transferring pointers or handles rather than copying data, making it
    much more efficient than copy operations. Developers should be aware that after
    a move assignment, the source object should not be used in any way that would
    access its former state.
  warnings: After calling operator= with a moved-from GroupMgr object, the source
    object becomes invalid and should not be accessed or used in any operations. Using
    the source object after a move assignment can lead to undefined behavior. Additionally,
    this operation is not thread-safe and should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments.
