  class: CalendarEvent
  method: GetTextureId
  signature: int32 CalendarEvent::GetTextureId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the texture ID associated with the calendar event for display purposes.
  description: The GetTextureId method returns an integer identifier that corresponds
    to a specific texture used in the game's user interface to represent the calendar
    event. This ID is typically used by the client to determine which icon or visual
    element should be displayed for the event in the calendar UI. The returned value
    usually maps to predefined textures within the game's asset system and may influence
    how the event appears to players when viewed in their calendar interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the texture ID used for displaying the calendar
    event in the UI. This value typically corresponds to an entry in the game's texture
    database or asset manifest, where each ID maps to a specific graphical representation
    such as an icon or emblem.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Use Texture ID
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    int32 textureId = event->GetTextureId();\n    // Use textureId to determine\
      \ UI element or icon for the event\n    printf(\"Event uses texture ID: %d\\\
      n\", textureId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with UI rendering code and calendar
    event display logic. The texture IDs are usually defined in game databases or
    configuration files, and may be subject to localization or expansion-specific
    variations.
