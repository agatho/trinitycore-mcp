documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat specialization instance is currently part of
    a group.
  description: The IsInGroup method checks if the current CombatSpecializationBase
    instance is associated with a player group, such as a raid or party. This is commonly
    used in combat specialization logic to determine if certain abilities or behaviors
    should be applied based on group composition. The method typically evaluates internal
    state flags or references to determine group membership status. It's important
    to note that this check may return false if the instance is not properly initialized
    or if the associated player has left their group.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization instance is currently part of
    a group (party or raid), and false otherwise. This indicates whether the specialization
    should consider group-based mechanics when evaluating combat actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Membership Check
    code: "if (specialization->IsInGroup()) {\n    // Apply group-specific combat\
      \ behavior\n    specialization->ApplyGroupBonus();\n} else {\n    // Use solo\
      \ combat settings\n    specialization->ApplySoloBonus();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage Based on Group Status
    code: "if (specialization->IsInGroup()) {\n    // Only allow group-oriented abilities\
      \ when in a group\n    if (player->HasSpell(12345)) {\n        player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 12345, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of group membership. It
    may not reflect real-time changes if the group composition has recently changed
    but the specialization hasn't been updated accordingly. The implementation typically
    checks for valid group references and active group status rather than performing
    expensive lookups.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where group membership
    might change rapidly, as cached states could lead to outdated results. Also ensure
    that the CombatSpecializationBase instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
