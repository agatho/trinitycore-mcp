  signature: void Bag::~Bag()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Bag object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Bag destructor is automatically invoked when a Bag object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of the bag's
    internal data structures, including releasing memory for items stored within the
    bag and notifying the game world that the bag is being destroyed. This destructor
    is part of the TrinityCore's object lifecycle management system and is crucial
    for preventing memory leaks and maintaining game state integrity. The destruction
    process typically involves calling parent class destructors and cleaning up any
    dynamically allocated resources specific to the Bag class.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of a Bag
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    Bag* bag = new Bag();\n    // ... use the bag\
      \ ...\n    delete bag; // Triggers ~Bag() destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated Bag Destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    Bag bag; // Constructor called\n    // ...\
      \ use the bag ...\n    // ~Bag() automatically called when bag goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Bag destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not
    be invoked manually. It's important to note that the destruction process may involve
    complex cleanup operations, including item stack management and potential notifications
    to the game world about item removal.
