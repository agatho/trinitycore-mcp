  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::UnregisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from memory management, cleaning up associated data structures
    and references.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the BotMemoryManager's
    internal tracking system. This function ensures that all memory allocations and
    references related to the bot are properly deallocated and removed from active
    management. It typically handles cleanup tasks such as removing the bot from internal
    lists, freeing allocated memory blocks, and invalidating any cached data associated
    with the bot. The method is crucial for maintaining proper memory hygiene in bot
    systems and preventing memory leaks when bots are destroyed or removed from the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered. This
      value must correspond to a valid bot that has been previously registered with
      the BotMemoryManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnregisterBot Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotMemoryManager::instance()->UnregisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe UnregisterBot with Validation
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetBotGuid();\nif (botGuid != 0)\n{\n    BotMemoryManager::instance()->UnregisterBot(botGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with a valid bot GUID that was previously
    registered. Calling this function with an invalid or unregistered GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory corruption. The implementation likely uses internal
    data structures such as hash maps or lists for efficient lookup and removal of
    bot entries.
  warnings: Calling UnregisterBot on a bot that has already been unregistered or does
    not exist in the manager's registry can result in undefined behavior. Always verify
    that the bot exists before unregistering it to prevent potential crashes or memory
    issues.
