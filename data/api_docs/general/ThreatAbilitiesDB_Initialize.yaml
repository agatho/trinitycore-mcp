documentation:
  brief: Initializes the threat abilities database for creature AI behavior.
  description: The Initialize method sets up internal data structures and loads configuration
    data required for managing threat abilities within the TrinityCore AI system.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when a new creature template
    is loaded to ensure that all threat-related abilities are properly registered
    and available for use in combat scenarios. It prepares the database with default
    values and validates existing entries to maintain consistency across the AI subsystem.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: ThreatAbilitiesDB::Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or memory leaks. The initialization process
    involves loading data from database tables and setting up internal lookup structures
    for fast access during combat.
