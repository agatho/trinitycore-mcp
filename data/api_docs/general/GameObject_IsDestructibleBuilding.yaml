documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is a destructible building.
  description: This method checks if the GameObject instance represents a destructible
    building, which is a type of game object that can be destroyed by player actions
    or other game mechanics. It returns true if the object is classified as a destructible
    building, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for determining how game
    objects behave in combat situations and for handling destruction mechanics within
    the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject is a destructible building, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the object can be destroyed by player actions or other
    game mechanics that affect building structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameObject->IsDestructibleBuilding()) {\n    // Handle destruction\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal object flags
    or type information to determine if the GameObject is a destructible building.
    Performance considerations: This check should be fast and lightweight as it''s
    frequently called during gameplay. Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as
    it only reads from internal state without modifying any data.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Not understanding that this method only applies to certain
    types of game objects. Dangerous edge cases: Using this method on non-building
    objects may lead to incorrect assumptions about object behavior in destruction
    scenarios.'
