  signature: float CombatMovementStrategy::GetOptimalDistance(FormationRole role)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat distance for a given formation
    role.
  description: The GetOptimalDistance method determines the recommended distance a
    unit should maintain from its target during combat based on the specified formation
    role. This distance is crucial for effective melee and ranged combat positioning,
    ensuring units can engage enemies appropriately while maintaining safety and tactical
    advantage. The method considers various factors such as weapon range, spell casting
    requirements, and unit type to compute an optimal distance that maximizes combat
    effectiveness. It is typically used by AI systems to guide movement behavior during
    combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal distance in yards for the
    specified formation role. The value is typically positive and represents the recommended
    distance from the target unit for effective combat positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float distance = strategy.GetOptimalDistance(FormationRole::LEADER);

      // Returns the optimal distance for a leader role in formation

      printf("Optimal distance: %.2f yards\n", distance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Movement Decision
    code: "if (unit->GetDistance(target) > strategy.GetOptimalDistance(FormationRole::FOLLOWER))\
      \ {\n    unit->MoveTowards(target, 1.0f);\n} else if (unit->GetDistance(target)\
      \ < strategy.GetOptimalDistance(FormationRole::FOLLOWER) * 0.8f) {\n    unit->MoveBackwards(1.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatMovementStrategy class and relies on internal
    configuration data that defines role-specific distances. The implementation may
    vary based on the specific AI behavior and unit type. The returned distance values
    are typically pre-calculated based on combat mechanics and unit statistics.
  warnings: The method assumes valid formation roles are passed; invalid role values
    may result in unexpected behavior or default distance calculations. This method
    should not be called during critical combat states where immediate movement decisions
    are required, as it may introduce slight delays due to calculation overhead.
