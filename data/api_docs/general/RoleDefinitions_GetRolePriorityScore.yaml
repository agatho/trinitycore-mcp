  signature: float RoleDefinitions::GetRolePriorityScore(uint8 classId, uint8 specId,
    GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority score for a given class and specialization
    role within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The GetRolePriorityScore method computes a numerical priority value
    that represents how suitable a specific class and specialization combination is
    for a given group role (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer). This score is
    used internally by TrinityCore's grouping and role assignment systems to optimize
    player distribution across roles in dungeons, raids, and other group content.
    The calculation considers various factors including class mechanics, spec-specific
    abilities, and role requirements. The method is typically invoked during group
    creation, role reassignment, or when evaluating optimal team compositions for
    specific encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's class (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR
      = 1, CLASS_PALADIN = 2, etc.). Valid values are defined in the TrinityCore class
      enumeration.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID within the specified class. Each class has
      multiple specializations (e.g., Warrior's Arms, Fury, Protection specs). Valid
      values depend on the classId parameter.
  - name: role
    description: The target group role to evaluate priority for. Values are typically
      defined as GROUP_ROLE_TANK, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, or GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE. This determines
      what type of role priority is calculated.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority score for the given
    class, spec, and role combination. Higher scores indicate better suitability for
    the specified role. Scores are normalized within a system-defined range (typically
    0.0 to 1.0) where 1.0 represents maximum priority.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate priority score for a Warrior Protection spec as a tank
    code: 'float score = RoleDefinitions::GetRolePriorityScore(CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_PROTECTION,
      GROUP_ROLE_TANK);

      // Returns a high priority score (e.g., 0.95) indicating strong suitability
      for tanking role'
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluate healer suitability for a Priest Shadow spec
    code: 'float score = RoleDefinitions::GetRolePriorityScore(CLASS_PRIEST, SPEC_SHADOW,
      GROUP_ROLE_HEALER);

      // Returns a moderate to high priority score (e.g., 0.75) reflecting Shadow
      Priest''s healing capabilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal role management system and
    may be subject to updates based on balance changes or new content additions. The
    exact scoring algorithm is not publicly exposed but is designed to reflect real-world
    gameplay mechanics and class specialization strengths.
  warnings: The returned scores are not guaranteed to be stable across different versions
    of TrinityCore, as they may change with game balance updates. Developers should
    not rely on specific numerical values for critical gameplay logic, only on relative
    comparisons between different combinations.
