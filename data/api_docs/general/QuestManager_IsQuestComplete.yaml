documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has completed a specific quest
  description: The IsQuestComplete method determines whether the player associated
    with this QuestManager instance has successfully completed the specified quest.
    This method typically checks the player's quest log and completion status for
    the given quest ID. It is commonly used in quest-related scripts, quest gating,
    and conditional logic within the TrinityCore framework. The method performs a
    lookup in the player's active and completed quests to verify if the quest has
    been marked as finished.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has been completed by the player, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player meets the completion criteria for the specified
    quest ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->IsQuestComplete(12345)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has completed quest 12345\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Gating
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nif (player->GetQuestManager()->IsQuestComplete(questId))\
      \ {\n    // Allow access to quest rewards or next stage\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You have completed the quest!\");\n} else {\n    // Prevent access until quest\
      \ is complete\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You must complete this quest\
      \ first.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest state stored in the database
    and may not reflect real-time changes without explicit updates. The QuestManager
    instance must be associated with a valid player object for this method to function
    correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual quest in the game database. Using invalid quest IDs may result in
    unexpected behavior or return false even when the quest should be considered complete.
