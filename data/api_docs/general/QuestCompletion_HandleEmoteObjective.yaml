documentation:
  brief: Processes emote-based quest objectives for a player bot
  description: The HandleEmoteObjective method is responsible for managing quest completion
    when an objective requires the player to perform a specific emote. This method
    is typically invoked during quest progression to check if the required emote has
    been executed by the player. It validates whether the emote performed matches
    the expected emote type defined in the quest objective and updates the quest progress
    accordingly. The method integrates with the TrinityCore's quest system to ensure
    proper tracking of emote-based requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      the emote. This player must be actively engaged in the quest with the specified
      objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the emote objective, including the required emote type and associated
      quest data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void exampleUsage(Player* player, QuestObjectiveData& obj) {\n    QuestCompletion\
      \ completion;\n    completion.HandleEmoteObjective(player, obj);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Update Logic
    code: "void processQuestEmote(Player* bot, uint32 questId, uint32 emoteId) {\n\
      \    if (Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId)) {\n   \
      \     QuestObjectiveData objective;\n        // Assume objective is populated\
      \ with emote data\n        QuestCompletion completion;\n        completion.HandleEmoteObjective(bot,\
      \ objective);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot has already been initialized and
    is in a valid state for quest progression. The method does not perform any direct
    database operations but relies on existing quest tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's
    framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective data passed to this method contains valid emote
    information, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The method should only be
    called when the player is actively engaged in a quest with emote requirements.
