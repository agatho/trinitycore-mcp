  method: GetShapeType
  signature: AreaTriggerShapeType AreaTriggerEntry::GetShapeType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the shape type of the area trigger entry.
  description: The GetShapeType method returns the AreaTriggerShapeType enumeration
    value that defines the geometric shape of the area trigger. This shape type determines
    how the trigger's boundaries are calculated and interpreted by the game engine.
    The returned value indicates whether the area trigger is a circle, sphere, box,
    or another defined shape, which affects collision detection and visual representation.
    This method is typically used during area trigger initialization and gameplay
    logic to determine how the trigger interacts with player movement and spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AreaTriggerShapeType enumeration value indicating the geometric shape
    of the area trigger. Possible values include CIRCLE, SPHERE, BOX, and other shape
    types defined in the AreaTriggerShapeType enum.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Trigger Shape
    code: "AreaTriggerEntry* entry = sAreaTriggerStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (entry)\n\
      {\n    AreaTriggerShapeType shapeType = entry->GetShapeType();\n    if (shapeType\
      \ == AREA_TRIGGER_SHAPE_CIRCLE)\n    {\n        // Handle circle-shaped area\
      \ trigger logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup operation and is expected to be called
    frequently during gameplay. The returned shape type directly influences how the
    area trigger's boundaries are processed in collision detection systems.
