  class: BotLoginQueryHolder
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotLoginQueryHolder::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot login query holder by setting up required database queries
    for bot authentication and account validation.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotLoginQueryHolder object for executing
    bot-related database operations. It sets up necessary SQL queries to validate
    bot accounts, check authentication status, and retrieve essential player data
    needed for bot login procedures. This method typically gets called during the
    initialization phase of a bot system or when a new bot connection is established.
    The method ensures that all required database connections and prepared statements
    are properly configured before any actual query execution occurs. It performs
    basic validation checks to confirm that the underlying database system is accessible
    and ready to handle bot authentication requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all database queries were successfully initialized and
    prepared, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates database
    connection issues, missing query templates, or other initialization failures that
    would prevent proper bot login functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotLoginQueryHolder queryHolder;\nbool success = queryHolder.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot login operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\"\
      , \"Bot login query holder initialized successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to initialize\
      \ bot login query holder\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotLoginQueryHolder
    instance. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method assumes that database connection parameters are already configured and
    available through the TrinityCore database system. It's recommended to check the
    return value before attempting any actual query execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method on an already initialized query holder without
    proper cleanup, as it may lead to memory leaks or inconsistent internal state.
    The method performs blocking operations during database preparation, so calling
    it from time-critical threads may impact performance. Ensure that the database
    is accessible and properly configured before invoking this method.
