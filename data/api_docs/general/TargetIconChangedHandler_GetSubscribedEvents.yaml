  signature: int TargetIconChangedHandler::GetSubscribedEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to in the TargetIconChangedHandler
    class.
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method retrieves the event subscription mask
    for the TargetIconChangedHandler. This handler is typically used within TrinityCore's
    AI and event system to manage when a creature or unit should respond to target
    icon changes, such as when a player sets or removes a raid marker on a target.
    The returned integer value represents a bitmask where each bit corresponds to
    a specific event type that this handler is interested in receiving notifications
    for. This method is commonly called during the initialization or registration
    phase of event handlers within the core game loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the events this handler is subscribed to.
    Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific event type, with common values
    including events related to target changes, combat state updates, and AI behavior
    triggers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TargetIconChangedHandler* handler = new TargetIconChangedHandler();\nint\
      \ subscribedEvents = handler->GetSubscribedEvents();\nif (subscribedEvents &\
      \ TARGET_ICON_CHANGED_EVENT)\n{\n    // Handle target icon change event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization of AI systems or
    when registering event handlers with the core event manager. The bitmask returned
    should be compared against predefined event constants to determine which specific
    events are being handled.
