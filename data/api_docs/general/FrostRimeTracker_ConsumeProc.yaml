  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void FrostRimeTracker::ConsumeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a proc from the FrostRimeTracker, reducing its active proc count
    or triggering associated effects.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the consumption
    of a proc event within the FrostRimeTracker system. This typically occurs when
    a spell or ability that has a chance to generate a proc is successfully executed
    and the proc condition is met. The method decrements the internal proc counter
    or triggers any associated effects tied to the proc, such as applying buffs, dealing
    damage, or modifying player stats. It ensures proper state management of the tracker's
    proc resources and may reset or update related cooldowns or timers. This method
    is generally called internally by the game engine when a proc condition is satisfied,
    but can also be invoked manually in specific scenarios involving custom spell
    handling or debugging.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Consumption
    code: 'FrostRimeTracker tracker;

      // Assume tracker has active procs

      tracker.ConsumeProc(); // Consumes one proc from the tracker'
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Proc Handling
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_FROST_RIME_PROC_AURA))\n{\n    FrostRimeTracker*\
      \ tracker = player->GetFrostRimeTracker();\n    if (tracker && tracker->HasActiveProcs())\n\
      \    {\n        tracker->ConsumeProc(); // Manually consume a proc\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a proc is actually consumed. It's
    important to ensure that the tracker has active procs before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or state corruption. The method may trigger additional
    events or callbacks depending on how the FrostRimeTracker is implemented within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Calling ConsumeProc without verifying that there are active procs can
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect state management. Always validate the
    proc count before consumption, especially in custom implementations or when dealing
    with multiple concurrent procs.
