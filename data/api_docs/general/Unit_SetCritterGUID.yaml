  class: Unit
  method: SetCritterGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetCritterGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of a critter for the unit.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a critter associated
    with the unit, allowing the system to track and manage the critter's properties
    within the game world. The method is typically used in scenarios where a unit
    needs to be linked to a specific critter entity, such as during creature spawning
    or when setting up special interactions. It ensures that the critter's GUID is
    properly initialized and maintained for further operations.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the critter to be set. This value
      must be a valid GUID within the TrinityCore system, typically representing a
      creature or object in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Critter GUID
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetCritterGUID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core functionality for managing critter-related
    data in TrinityCore. It should be used carefully as it affects how the system
    tracks and interacts with critters. The GUID value must be valid and unique within
    the context of the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect tracking of critter
    entities, potentially causing issues with game mechanics or object management.
    Ensure that the GUID being set is valid and corresponds to an actual critter in
    the game world.
