documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific action from the strategy by its name.
  description: The GetAction method retrieves a shared pointer to an Action object
    from the Strategy's internal collection based on the provided action name. This
    method is typically used within AI decision-making systems to fetch predefined
    actions that can be executed in response to certain game events or conditions.
    The returned Action object contains information about what action should be performed,
    such as spell casting, movement, or targeting behavior. The method performs a
    lookup operation using the action name as a key, and will return a valid shared
    pointer if the action exists, or a null pointer if no matching action is found.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<Action> pointing to the requested action if it exists
    in the strategy, or a null pointer if no action with the specified name is found.
    The returned pointer manages the lifetime of the Action object automatically through
    reference counting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::shared_ptr<Action> action = strategy->GetAction(\"cast_fireball\"\
      );\nif (action)\n{\n    // Execute the action\n    action->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Action Retrieval
    code: "auto action = strategy->GetAction(\"move_to_target\");\nif (action)\n{\n\
      \    // Process action\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Found action: {}\", action->GetName());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    LOG_WARNING(\"AI\", \"Action not found in strategy\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. The returned Action object should be used
    carefully as it's managed by shared_ptr, so ensure proper reference counting to
    avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers. The strategy must be properly initialized
    with actions before calling this method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer without checking for null,
    as accessing a null Action could cause undefined behavior. This method assumes
    that action names are unique within a strategy; duplicate names may lead to unpredictable
    results during lookup operations.
