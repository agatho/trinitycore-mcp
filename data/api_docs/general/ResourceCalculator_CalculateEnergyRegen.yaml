  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: CalculateEnergyRegen
  signature: float ResourceCalculator::CalculateEnergyRegen(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the energy regeneration rate for a player based on
    their current stats and class.
  description: The CalculateEnergyRegen method determines how quickly a player's energy
    resource regenerates over time. This calculation takes into account various factors
    such as the player's class, level, equipment, buffs, debuffs, and any applicable
    modifiers. The result is a floating-point value representing the amount of energy
    regenerated per second. This method is typically used in the game's resource management
    system to update player energy levels during combat or idle periods. It serves
    as a core component in maintaining gameplay balance and ensuring that players
    can effectively manage their energy-based abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which energy regeneration is being
      calculated. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid player
      instance with initialized stats and attributes.
  returns: A float value representing the energy regeneration rate in energy per second.
    The value may be positive, zero, or negative depending on game state and modifiers.
    Returns 0.0 if the player pointer is invalid or if no regeneration occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      float regenRate = ResourceCalculator::CalculateEnergyRegen(player);

      printf("Energy regen rate: %.2f per second\n", regenRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerEnergy(Player* player) {\n    float regenRate = ResourceCalculator::CalculateEnergyRegen(player);\n\
      \    if (regenRate > 0.0f) {\n        player->AddEnergy(regenRate * deltaTime);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game formulas that may vary by class and
    specialization. The calculation might be affected by temporary effects like potions,
    talents, or environmental factors. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight
    as it's called frequently during gameplay updates.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer is valid before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
    This method may return unexpected values if the player object has not been fully
    initialized with all required stats and attributes.
