documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BugTicket instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The BugTicket destructor is automatically invoked when a BugTicket
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, database connections, or other resources
    held by the bug ticket instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    server implementation, this typically involves removing the ticket from internal
    tracking structures and potentially marking it for database cleanup if it was
    not already persisted. The destructor is a critical part of the object lifecycle
    management and should never be called manually unless explicitly needed for resource
    cleanup in special circumstances.

  - title: Automatic destruction of BugTicket
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BugTicket* ticket = new BugTicket();\n    //\
      \ ... use ticket ...\n    delete ticket; // Destructor called here\n}\n\n//\
      \ Or automatic destruction\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    BugTicket ticket;\n\
      \    // Destructor automatically called when ticket goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked directly unless implementing custom memory management. In TrinityCore,
    bug tickets are typically managed through smart pointers or container classes
    that automatically handle destruction. The implementation may involve database
    cleanup operations if the ticket was never submitted to the database.
