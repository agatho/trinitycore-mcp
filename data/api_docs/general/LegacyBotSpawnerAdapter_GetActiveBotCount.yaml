  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::GetActiveBotCount(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active legacy bots within the specified zone.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method retrieves the number of legacy bots currently
    active in a given zone. This method is typically used by bot management systems
    or game logic to monitor and control the number of active bots per zone. The method
    takes a zone identifier as input and returns the total count of bots that are
    currently spawned and active within that specific zone. It does not account for
    inactive or despawned bots, only those that are currently in the world and functional.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which to count active bots.
      This value typically corresponds to a valid zone or map ID within the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active legacy bots in the specified
    zone. Returns zero if no bots are active in the zone or if the zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 botCount = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(1234); // Count bots in\
      \ zone 1234\nif (botCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"There are %u active bots in\
      \ this zone.\\n\", botCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Zone Bot Limits
    code: "uint32 currentBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(player->GetZoneId());\n\
      if (currentBots >= MAX_BOTS_PER_ZONE)\n{\n    // Prevent spawning more bots\
      \ in this zone\n    player->SendNotification(\"Maximum number of bots reached\
      \ in this zone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup or query against an internal data structure
    that tracks active bot instances. It may involve iterating through a list or map
    of spawned bots and filtering by zone ID. The performance impact is expected to
    be minimal for typical use cases, but repeated calls in tight loops should be
    avoided.
  warnings: Ensure the zoneId parameter corresponds to a valid zone within the game
    world. Passing an invalid zone ID may result in unexpected behavior or return
    incorrect counts. This method assumes that bot activity state is properly maintained
    by the system.
