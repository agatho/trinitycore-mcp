documentation:
  brief: Generates soul fragments for the Havoc specialization
  description: The GenerateFragments method creates a specified number of soul fragments,
    typically used in the Havoc demon hunter's gameplay mechanics. This method is
    responsible for managing the accumulation and distribution of soul fragments,
    which are essential resources for various abilities and talents within the Havoc
    specialization. The generated fragments may be stored internally or made available
    for immediate use by other systems in the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of soul fragments to generate. Must be a positive integer
      representing the quantity of fragments to create.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'HavocSoulFragmentTracker tracker;

      tracker.GenerateFragments(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Fragments Based on Player Action
    code: "void OnPlayerAbilityUsed(Player* player) {\n    HavocSoulFragmentTracker*\
      \ tracker = player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker();\n    if (tracker) {\n   \
      \     tracker->GenerateFragments(1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal fragment counters and may trigger
    events or updates to the player's UI when fragments are generated. It should be
    called only when appropriate for Havoc gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the count parameter is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or resource overflow. Improper use of this method
    could lead to incorrect fragment accumulation or game state inconsistencies.
