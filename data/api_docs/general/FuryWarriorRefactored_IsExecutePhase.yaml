  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: IsExecutePhase
  signature: bool FuryWarriorRefactored::IsExecutePhase(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Fury Warrior is currently in Execute phase based on
    target's health percentage.
  description: The IsExecutePhase method evaluates if the Fury Warrior should enter
    or remain in Execute phase, which is a combat state where the warrior's abilities
    become more powerful and efficient. This typically occurs when the target's health
    drops below a certain threshold, usually around 20% or less. The method checks
    the current target's health percentage against predefined thresholds to determine
    if Execute mechanics should be active. It is commonly used in AI decision-making
    logic to switch between different combat strategies based on enemy health status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current target is at or below the Execute threshold
    (typically 20% health), indicating that Execute phase abilities should be active.
    Returns false otherwise, meaning standard combat abilities should be used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (player->GetFuryWarriorRefactored()->IsExecutePhase(target)) {\n   \
      \ // Use Execute phase abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EXECUTE,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Use standard abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SLAM, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking execute phase before ability selection
    code: "FuryWarriorRefactored* furyWarrior = player->GetFuryWarriorRefactored();\n\
      if (furyWarrior && furyWarrior->IsExecutePhase(target)) {\n    // Prioritize\
      \ Execute abilities\n    if (player->HasSpell(SPELL_BLOODTHIRST_EXECUTE)) {\n\
      \        player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BLOODTHIRST_EXECUTE, true);\n    }\
      \ else {\n        player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EXECUTE, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the current target being set and valid. The exact health
    threshold for Execute phase may vary based on game updates or class specialization
    changes. The method is typically called during combat decision-making cycles in
    AI logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring a valid target exists, as it
    may lead to undefined behavior. The Execute threshold percentage might change
    with game balance updates, so implementations should be flexible to accommodate
    potential changes.
