documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceCoordination object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InstanceCoordination class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This includes cleaning up internal data structures, releasing references to game
    objects, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class likely manages coordination logic for instance-related
    operations such as player entry, exit, or synchronization within a dungeon or
    raid instance. The destructor ensures proper cleanup when an instance coordination
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of InstanceCoordination
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coord = new InstanceCoordination();

      // ... use the instance coordination object ...

      delete coord; // Triggers ~InstanceCoordination()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called automatically when an object goes out of
    scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless
    performing low-level memory management. The destruction process may involve notifying
    other systems about instance cleanup, particularly in multi-threaded environments
    where synchronization might be required.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the object are
    cleared before deletion to prevent use-after-free errors.
