  brief: Moves ownership of a PoolMgr object to another PoolMgr instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the right-hand
    side PoolMgr object to the left-hand side object, leaving the source object in
    a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of internal data structures without performing expensive deep
    copies. In the context of TrinityCore's pooling system, this allows for efficient
    management of pool containers and their associated data without unnecessary memory
    allocations or copying operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the left-hand side PoolMgr object after the move assignment
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'PoolMgr manager1;

      PoolMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move-assigns manager1 to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<PoolMgr> managers;

      managers.emplace_back();

      managers.back() = std::move(someOtherManager);

      // Efficiently transfers ownership of pool data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used in scenarios where PoolMgr objects need to
    be efficiently transferred between containers or when implementing move semantics
    for classes that contain PoolMgr members. The source object after move assignment
    should not be used until it's reassigned or moved from again.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the right-hand side object becomes invalid
    and should not be accessed. Using the moved-from object may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any pointers or references to the moved object are not used
    afterward.
