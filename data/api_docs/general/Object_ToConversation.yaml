  class: Object
  method: ToConversation
  signature: const Conversation * Object::ToConversation() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the Conversation object associated with this Object.
  description: The ToConversation method is used to retrieve the Conversation object
    that is linked to the current Object instance. This method is typically employed
    in the context of World of Warcraft's conversation system, where objects such
    as NPCs or players may be associated with specific conversations. The method returns
    a const pointer to the Conversation, indicating that the returned object should
    not be modified directly. It serves as a bridge between object instances and their
    conversation data, allowing developers to access conversation-related information
    for gameplay mechanics or scripting purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to the Conversation object if the Object is associated
    with a conversation; otherwise, it returns nullptr if no conversation is linked
    to the object. The returned pointer may be used to access conversation properties
    and methods without modifying the original object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Conversation* conv = obj->ToConversation();\nif (conv != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the conversation object\n    std::cout << \"Conversation ID: \"\
      \ << conv->GetID() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Object-related methods
    to determine conversation associations. It is important to note that the returned
    Conversation object may be nullptr if no conversation is assigned to the object,
    and developers should always check for null before dereferencing the pointer.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to dangling pointers
    if the Conversation object is destroyed or removed from memory. Additionally,
    the method should not be used in situations where modification of the conversation
    object is required, as it returns a const pointer.
