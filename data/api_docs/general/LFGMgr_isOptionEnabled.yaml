  class: LFGMgr
  method: isOptionEnabled
  signature: bool LFGMgr::isOptionEnabled(uint32 option)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific LFG option is enabled in the system
  description: The isOptionEnabled method determines if a particular Looking For Group
    (LFG) option, identified by its unique option ID, is currently enabled within
    the TrinityCore LFG manager. This functionality is essential for managing player
    group finding behavior and ensuring that only valid options are considered during
    LFG operations. The method typically checks against internal configuration flags
    or settings that control various aspects of LFG system behavior such as dungeon
    eligibility, role restrictions, or queue management.
  parameters:
  - name: option
    description: The unique identifier for the LFG option to check. This value corresponds
      to predefined LFG option constants defined within the TrinityCore codebase.
  returns: Returns true if the specified LFG option is enabled, false otherwise. A
    return value of true indicates that the given LFG option is active and can be
    used in LFG operations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Dungeon Finder option is enabled
    code: "if (sLFGMgr->isOptionEnabled(LFG_OPTION_DUNGEON_FINDER)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with dungeon finding logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional LFG behavior based on option state
    code: "bool isRoleCheckingEnabled = sLFGMgr->isOptionEnabled(LFG_OPTION_ROLE_CHECK);\n\
      if (isRoleCheckingEnabled) {\n    // Enable role checking during group formation\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip role checking for performance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal LFG configuration data structures and
    may involve thread-safe operations depending on how the LFG manager is implemented.
    It's important to understand that option IDs are typically defined as constants
    in the LFG system and should not be arbitrary values.
  warnings: Ensure that the option ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    LFG option defined in the codebase, as invalid option IDs might lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. The method may not be thread-safe if accessed from
    multiple threads without proper synchronization.
