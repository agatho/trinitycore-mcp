  method: RecordPerformanceEvent
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::RecordPerformanceEvent(uint32_t botGuid,
    const std::string & eventType, double value)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance event for a specific bot with associated data.
  description: The RecordPerformanceEvent method logs a performance-related event
    for a specified bot, capturing the event type and its corresponding value. This
    functionality is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to track and
    analyze bot behavior, resource usage, or other performance metrics. The method
    stores this information in an internal analytics system that can be queried later
    for debugging, optimization, or statistical analysis purposes. It does not return
    any value and operates synchronously.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the performance event
      is being recorded. Must be a valid GUID representing an existing bot in the
      system.
  - name: eventType
    description: String describing the type of performance event being logged. Examples
      include 'cpu_usage', 'memory_consumption', or 'ai_decision_time'. Should be
      consistent across similar events for accurate analysis.
  - name: value
    description: Numeric value associated with the performance event. Represents the
      measured quantity such as time in milliseconds, percentage usage, or count of
      operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.RecordPerformanceEvent(12345, "cpu_usage", 45.6);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Events for a Bot
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.RecordPerformanceEvent(12345, "ai_decision_time", 12.3);

      analytics.RecordPerformanceEvent(12345, "memory_consumption", 87.2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not introduce significant
    overhead during normal operation. It assumes that the bot GUID is valid and corresponds
    to an active bot instance. The internal storage mechanism may have limits on how
    many events are retained, so repeated calls for the same bot should consider potential
    memory implications.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid before calling this method;
    otherwise, behavior is undefined. Avoid recording excessive or unnecessary events
    as it might impact performance or consume too much memory in long-running applications.
