documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG boot proposal update packet to the player's client.
  description: This method sends a packet to the World of Warcraft client informing
    the player about a LFG (Looking for Group) boot proposal. The boot proposal is
    initiated when a group leader votes to kick a member from a group. This packet
    contains information about the vote, including the target player, the reason for
    the boot, and the time remaining for the vote. The method is typically called
    by the server when a LFG boot vote is started or updated.
  parameters:
  - name: boot
    description: A reference to an lfg::LfgPlayerBoot structure containing the boot
      proposal data including the target player, voting information, and time remaining.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a LFG Boot Proposal Update
    code: 'lfg::LfgPlayerBoot boot;

      boot.target = playerGuid;

      boot.reason = "Player is AFK";

      boot.timeRemaining = 30;

      SendLfgBootProposalUpdate(boot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly sends a network packet to the client, so it should only
    be called from the main game thread. The boot proposal data is expected to be
    properly initialized before calling this method.
