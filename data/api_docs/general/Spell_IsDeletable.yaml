  class: Spell
  method: IsDeletable
  signature: bool Spell::IsDeletable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can be safely deleted from the spell list.
  description: The IsDeletable method checks if a spell is eligible for removal from
    the player's spell book or character's spell list. This method is crucial for
    managing spell deletion operations, particularly in scenarios where spells might
    be removed due to level requirements, skill loss, or other game mechanics. It
    ensures that only valid and non-critical spells are considered for deletion, preventing
    potential issues with spell tracking and player experience.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can be safely deleted, false otherwise. A return
    value of false indicates that the spell is either critical to gameplay or has
    special restrictions that prevent its removal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsDeletable()) {\n    // Remove spell from player's spell list\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell management
    functions to ensure proper handling of spell removal. Implementation may vary
    depending on the specific spell type and game mechanics involved.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as incorrect use could lead
    to loss of important spells or game functionality. The method may not always reflect
    actual deletion eligibility in all scenarios.
