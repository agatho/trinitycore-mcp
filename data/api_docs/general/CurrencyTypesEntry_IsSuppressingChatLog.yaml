documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type suppresses chat log entries when acquired.
  description: The IsSuppressingChatLog method checks if a specific currency type
    is configured to prevent chat log messages from being displayed when the player
    acquires that currency. This is typically used for currencies that are acquired
    frequently or through automated means, such as reputation rewards or daily quest
    rewards, to avoid spamming the chat log with repetitive notifications. The method
    returns true if the currency should suppress chat log entries, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is part of the TrinityCore's currency system implementation
    and affects how in-game messages are displayed to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type suppresses chat log entries when acquired;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a currency suppresses chat log
    code: "CurrencyTypesEntry* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif\
      \ (entry && entry->IsSuppressingChatLog()) {\n    // Do not show chat message\
      \ for this currency\n    sLog->outString(\"Currency 1234 suppresses chat log.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game's currency acquisition
    system to determine whether to display a chat message when a player receives a
    specific type of currency. It may be related to the 'SuppressChatLog' flag in
    the CurrencyTypes.dbc file.
