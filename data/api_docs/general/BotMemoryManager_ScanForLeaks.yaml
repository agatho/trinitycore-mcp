documentation:
  brief: Scans the bot memory manager for potential memory leaks and reports any detected
    issues.
  description: The ScanForLeaks method performs a comprehensive analysis of the bot
    memory manager's allocated memory blocks to identify any potential memory leaks.
    This function is typically invoked during debugging sessions or system maintenance
    to ensure that no memory is being unnecessarily retained by bot instances. It
    checks for unreleased memory allocations, dangling pointers, and other common
    memory management issues specific to the TrinityCore bot framework. The method
    does not modify any existing state but instead logs diagnostic information about
    detected leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Mode
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->ScanForLeaks(); // Logs any detected memory leaks to the console'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development purposes.
    In production environments, it may be disabled or optimized for performance. The
    scan process can be resource-intensive and should not be called frequently in
    high-performance scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method during active bot operations may produce false positives
    if bots are in the middle of memory allocations. It is recommended to run this
    method when no bots are actively processing to get accurate results.
