documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific gossip menu item by its unique identifier from the current
    gossip menu.
  description: The GetItem method retrieves a GossipMenuItem object from the current
    gossip menu based on the provided gossipOptionId. This method is typically used
    within NPC gossip interactions to access specific menu options that have been
    previously added to the gossip menu. The method performs a lookup operation to
    find the matching item, returning a pointer to the item if found or nullptr if
    no matching item exists. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this functionality
    supports dynamic NPC dialog systems where different menu options can be conditionally
    displayed or modified during runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: gossipOptionId
    description: The unique identifier for the gossip menu option to retrieve. This
      corresponds to the ID used when adding items to the gossip menu via AddMenuItem().
      Valid values are typically positive integers representing the index or assigned
      ID of the menu item.
  returns: A pointer to the const GossipMenuItem object if an item with the specified
    gossipOptionId exists in the menu, or nullptr if no matching item is found. The
    returned pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal data
    managed by the GossipMenu class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve a gossip menu item
    code: "GossipMenuItem* menuItem = gossipMenu->GetItem(5);\nif (menuItem != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the retrieved menu item\n    sLog->outString(\"Found menu\
      \ item with text: %s\", menuItem->m_text.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetItem in a gossip handler to process selections
    code: "void NPCGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    ClearGossipMenuFor(player);\n\
      \    AddMenuItem(0, 1, \"Trade\", GOSSIP_OPTION_TRADE);\n    AddMenuItem(0,\
      \ 2, \"Quests\", GOSSIP_OPTION_QUESTGIVER);\n    SendGossipMenuFor(player, DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE,\
      \ creature->GetGUID());\n}\n\nvoid NPCGossipSelect(Player* player, Creature*\
      \ creature, uint32 sender, uint32 action)\n{\n    GossipMenuItem* item = player->GetSession()->GetGossipMenu().GetItem(action);\n\
      \    if (item != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Handle specific menu option based\
      \ on retrieved item\n        switch (action)\n        {\n            case 1:\n\
      \                player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(creature->GetGUID());\n\
      \                break;\n            case 2:\n                // Handle quest\
      \ selection\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal gossip menu items,
    so performance may degrade with large numbers of menu options. The returned GossipMenuItem
    pointer is valid only as long as the GossipMenu object remains in scope and has
    not been modified. This method should not be used to modify menu items directly;
    instead, use appropriate AddMenuItem or RemoveMenuItem methods.
  warnings: Calling GetItem with an invalid gossipOptionId (e.g., one that was never
    added) will return nullptr, which must be checked before dereferencing the returned
    pointer. Never attempt to delete or modify the returned GossipMenuItem object
    directly as it is managed by the internal GossipMenu system.
