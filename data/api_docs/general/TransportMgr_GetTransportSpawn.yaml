documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a transport spawn entry by its unique identifier from the transport
    manager.
  description: The GetTransportSpawn method retrieves a const pointer to a TransportSpawn
    object corresponding to the specified spawn ID. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to access predefined transport spawn data, which defines
    how and where transports (such as boats or zeppelins) appear in the game world.
    The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the TransportMgr instance
    and should not be modified. This method performs a lookup in an internal container
    that maps spawn IDs to their respective transport spawn definitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the TransportSpawn object associated with the given
    spawnId, or nullptr if no such spawn ID exists in the manager.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use a transport spawn
    code: "const TransportSpawn* spawn = sTransportMgr->GetTransportSpawn(12345);\n\
      if (spawn)\n{\n    // Use spawn data to initialize or manage a transport\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Found transport spawn for ID: %u\", spawn->SpawnId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during server initialization and runtime transport
    management. It's important to note that the TransportSpawn objects are immutable
    once loaded, and the pointer returned should never be deleted or modified directly.
