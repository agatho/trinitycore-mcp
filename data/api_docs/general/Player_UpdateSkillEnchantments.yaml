documentation:
  brief: Updates enchantments associated with a player's skill level changes.
  description: The UpdateSkillEnchantments method is responsible for managing and
    updating any active enchantments that are tied to a specific skill. When a player's
    skill value changes, this method ensures that any applicable enchantments are
    recalculated or adjusted accordingly. This typically involves checking if the
    new skill level triggers new enchantment effects or if existing enchantments need
    to be removed or modified based on the updated skill value. The method is generally
    called internally by the game engine when skill levels are modified through various
    means such as training, quest completion, or item usage.
  parameters:
  - name: skill_id
    description: The unique identifier of the skill being updated. This corresponds
      to a specific skill in the player's skill list, such as Blacksmithing (ID 164)
      or Enchanting (ID 333).
  - name: curr_value
    description: The current value of the skill before the update. This is used to
      determine if any changes in enchantments are necessary based on thresholds or
      progression.
  - name: new_value
    description: The new value of the skill after the update. This value determines
      what enchantments should be applied or removed based on skill level requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Enchantments After Skill Increase
    code: "void OnPlayerSkillUpdate(Player* player, uint16 skillId, uint16 oldValue,\
      \ uint16 newValue)\n{\n    if (oldValue < newValue)\n        player->UpdateSkillEnchantments(skillId,\
      \ oldValue, newValue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game engine when a
    skill value changes. Developers should not generally call this method directly
    unless implementing custom skill progression logic or enchantment systems. The
    method may trigger updates to player stats, spell effects, or item bonuses that
    are dependent on skill levels.
  warnings: Directly calling this method without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    game state or unexpected behavior. Ensure that skill value changes are properly
    validated before invoking this method.
