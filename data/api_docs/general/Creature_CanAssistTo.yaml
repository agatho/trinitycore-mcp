    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can assist another creature in combat.
  description: The CanAssistTo method checks if a creature is able to provide assistance
    to another creature during combat. This method evaluates whether the assisting
    creature's faction or relationship with the target creature allows for assistance,
    and is commonly used in AI behavior to determine if a creature should engage in
    combat with another creature. It typically returns true when the creature can
    assist another creature based on faction relationships, but may return false under
    certain conditions such as when the creature is neutral or hostile towards the
    target.
  parameters:
  - name: u
    description: Pointer to the creature that is being checked for ability to assist.
      This parameter represents the creature's own instance and is used to determine
      faction relationships.
  - name: enemy
    description: Pointer to the creature that the first creature is attempting to
      assist. This parameter represents the target creature and is used to determine
      if the assisting creature can engage in combat with it.
  - name: checkfaction
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether faction checks should be performed.
      When true, the method will evaluate faction relationships; when false, it may
      bypass faction checks and return a more general result.
  returns: Returns true if the creature can assist another creature in combat, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the creature is neutral or hostile towards
    the target, or if faction checks prevent assistance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanAssistTo(&targetCreature, &enemyCreature, true)) {\n \
      \   // Creature can assist in combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "bool result = creature->CanAssistTo(&targetCreature, &enemyCreature, false);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Perform assistance logic\n} else {\n    // Do not assist\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in AI scripts to determine if a creature should
    engage in combat with another. It may be affected by faction settings and the
    creature's relationship with the target. Performance considerations include checking
    faction relationships efficiently.
  warnings: This method may return false even when the creature is not directly hostile
    towards the target, due to faction-based restrictions. Be cautious when using
    this method in AI logic as it can affect combat behavior.
