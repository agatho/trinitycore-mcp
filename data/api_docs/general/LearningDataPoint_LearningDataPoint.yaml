documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LearningDataPoint class with default values.
  description: The LearningDataPoint constructor initializes a new instance of the
    LearningDataPoint class. This method sets up the internal state of the object,
    typically initializing member variables to their default values or null states.
    In the context of TrinityCore's learning and skill systems, this class likely
    represents a data point used for tracking player learning progress, skill acquisition,
    or experience gain. The constructor ensures that all necessary fields are properly
    initialized before the object can be used in gameplay mechanics involving character
    progression.

  - title: Creating a new LearningDataPoint instance
    code: 'LearningDataPoint dataPoint;

      // Initializes a new LearningDataPoint with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, meaning it takes no parameters. It's typically
    used when creating objects on the stack or when the object needs to be initialized
    with default state values. In TrinityCore's architecture, such constructors are
    often paired with assignment operators or factory methods for more complex initialization.
