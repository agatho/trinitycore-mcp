  brief: Checks whether the player's taxi path is empty
  description: The PlayerTaxi::empty() method determines if a player has any active
    taxi path nodes in their current taxi route. This method is commonly used to verify
    whether a player is currently on a taxi flight or has completed all waypoints
    in their journey. The implementation likely checks internal data structures that
    store the taxi path information, such as a list or queue of destination nodes.
    When empty(), it returns true if no further taxi destinations remain in the player's
    current path, indicating either completion of the flight or no active taxi route.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's taxi path contains no remaining waypoints
    or destinations; false otherwise. A return value of true typically indicates that
    the player has finished their taxi journey or is not currently on a taxi route.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player has completed taxi journey
    code: "if (player->GetTaxi().empty()) {\n    // Player has completed their taxi\
      \ flight\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Prevent taxi path modification when empty
    code: "if (!player->GetTaxi().empty()) {\n    // Safe to modify or add new taxi\
      \ destinations\n    player->GetTaxi().AddTaxiDestination(destinationNode);\n\
      } else {\n    // No current taxi path - handle accordingly\n    player->SendTaxiPathError(TAXI_ERROR_NO_PATH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other taxi-related APIs
    to manage player movement during flight paths. It's important to note that a taxi
    path being empty does not necessarily mean the player has landed - it simply means
    there are no more intermediate waypoints to visit.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in time-sensitive contexts, as the
    state of a player's taxi path can change rapidly during gameplay. Also, ensure
    proper synchronization if checking this value from different threads or game systems.
