  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: Update
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot performance monitoring state with the specified time difference.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the bot performance monitor by processing the elapsed time delta provided in the
    'diff' parameter. This method typically handles performance metrics collection,
    logging, or triggering alerts based on configured thresholds. It's designed to
    be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate tracking of bot
    behavior and resource usage. The implementation may involve updating counters,
    calculating averages, or notifying other systems about performance changes.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value represents how much time has passed since the previous invocation of this
      method and is used to calculate time-based performance metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... game logic\
      \ ...\n    botPerformanceMonitor->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... AI logic ...\n    performanceMonitor->Update(diff);\n\
      \    // ... more AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently, typically every game tick or at
    regular intervals during the main game loop. The 'diff' parameter must represent
    actual elapsed time in milliseconds to ensure accurate performance tracking. Implementation
    may involve thread-safe operations if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero time differences can lead to
    inaccurate performance metrics. Ensure that the 'diff' value is always a positive
    integer representing real elapsed time. Do not call this method from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization.
