documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all active world events into the AdvancedBehaviorManager's
    event system.
  description: The LoadWorldEvents method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all currently active world events from the database or configuration files into
    the AdvancedBehaviorManager's internal event tracking system. This method ensures
    that all registered world events are properly configured and ready to be triggered
    based on in-game conditions or time-based criteria. It typically runs during server
    startup or when the behavior manager is initialized, setting up event handlers
    and state tracking for events such as holiday celebrations, seasonal activities,
    or special in-game occurrences. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the internal state of the AdvancedBehaviorManager to reflect loaded events.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.LoadWorldEvents();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the AdvancedBehaviorManager. It is typically invoked automatically by the server's
    core initialization process, but may also be manually triggered if new events
    are added dynamically at runtime.
