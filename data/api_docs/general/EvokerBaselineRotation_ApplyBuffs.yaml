  class: EvokerBaselineRotation
  method: ApplyBuffs
  signature: void EvokerBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies necessary buffs to the evoker bot based on current combat state and
    resource availability.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buffs to an evoker AI bot. This includes managing the application of various beneficial
    effects such as damage increases, defensive auras, or utility enhancements that
    are relevant to the current gameplay situation. The method evaluates the bot's
    current state, including health, mana levels, combat status, and available cooldowns
    to decide which buffs should be applied. It ensures optimal performance by selecting
    buffs that align with the evoker's rotation strategy and the overall tactical
    needs of the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or index within
      the AI system. This parameter is used to access and modify the specific evoker
      bot instance being controlled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI control loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_isInCombat)\n        m_rotation.ApplyBuffs(&m_botId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void EvokerBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int* bot)\n{\n    if (*bot < 0\
      \ || *bot >= MAX_BOTS)\n        return;\n    \n    // Logic to determine and\
      \ apply buffs\n    ApplyDamageBuff(*bot);\n    ApplyDefensiveBuff(*bot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat to ensure that the evoker
    maintains optimal buff states. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    evoker specialization and encounter requirements. Consider performance implications
    when applying multiple buffs simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid bot index before calling
    this method, as invalid indices can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
    Avoid calling ApplyBuffs during critical sections where other AI operations might
    conflict with buff application logic.
