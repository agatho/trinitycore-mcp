  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotResourcePool class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotResourcePool
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the resource pool exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access shared resources
    and data structures that manage bot-related game objects, items, or other entities.
    The returned pointer provides global access to the resource pool without requiring
    explicit instantiation. This implementation is thread-safe in most TrinityCore
    contexts, though developers should verify the specific threading model of their
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotResourcePool instance. Returns a valid pointer
    to the singleton object; never returns NULL under normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotResourcePool singleton
    code: "BotResourcePool* pool = BotResourcePool::instance();\nif (pool)\n{\n  \
      \  // Use the resource pool\n    pool->SomeMethod();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the singleton in a bot management context
    code: "void ManageBots()\n{\n    BotResourcePool* pool = BotResourcePool::instance();\n\
      \    if (!pool)\n        return;\n    \n    // Access shared bot resources\n\
      \    std::vector<Bot*> bots = pool->GetAllBots();\n    for (auto& bot : bots)\n\
      \    {\n        if (bot && bot->IsAlive())\n            bot->Update();\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern. The instance is typically
    initialized on first access and persists for the application lifetime. Since this
    is a TrinityCore API component, it's designed to work within the game server's
    execution context where singletons are commonly used for resource management.
  warnings: While this is a standard singleton implementation, be cautious when mocking
    or testing code that depends on this method, as it creates global state dependencies.
    Avoid calling this in contexts where thread safety might be compromised if not
    properly synchronized.
