  method: EndReadyCheck
  signature: void Group::EndReadyCheck()
documentation:
  brief: Ends the ready check process for the group, notifying members and clearing
    the ready status.
  description: The EndReadyCheck method terminates an ongoing ready check within a
    group. It is typically invoked when a group leader or system needs to conclude
    a ready check that was initiated with StartReadyCheck. This method notifies all
    group members of the completion of the check, clears their individual ready statuses,
    and ensures that the group's ready check state is reset. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs no return operations. It is commonly used in scenarios
    such as raid encounters where players must confirm their readiness before proceeding,
    or when a leader decides to cancel an ongoing check.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ending a Ready Check in a Raid Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->isRaidGroup())\
      \ {\n    group->EndReadyCheck();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a ready check is actually in progress.
    Calling it outside of an active ready check may lead to unexpected behavior or
    state inconsistencies within the group. The method internally handles synchronization
    and ensures all group members are properly notified.
  warnings: Do not call EndReadyCheck unless you are certain that a ready check has
    been started. Calling this method without an active ready check can cause undefined
    behavior in group management systems.
