documentation:
  brief: Updates boss combat timers based on elapsed time since last update
  description: The UpdateBossTimers method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal timers associated with boss encounters in combat. It processes the
    time difference (diff) passed to it to determine if any boss-specific timers should
    be advanced, reset, or triggered. This method is typically called during the game's
    main update loop and ensures that boss mechanics such as phase transitions, ability
    cooldowns, or encounter durations are accurately tracked. The method operates
    on the internal state of the CombatStateAnalyzer instance and modifies timer values
    accordingly without returning any data.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    _combatAnalyzer.UpdateBossTimers(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during combat updates. It
    relies on accurate timing information passed via the 'diff' parameter, which represents
    milliseconds since last update. The implementation likely uses internal timer
    structures that track boss-specific states and transitions.
