  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: FlushOldRecords
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::FlushOldRecords(uint64_t olderThanMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Removes AI decision records older than the specified time threshold from
    the profiler.
  description: The FlushOldRecords method clears outdated AI decision profiling data
    from the AIDecisionProfiler instance. It removes all recorded decisions that have
    a timestamp older than the provided microseconds threshold. This method is typically
    used to prevent memory bloat and maintain performance by periodically cleaning
    up stale profiling information. The profiler maintains a history of AI decisions
    for debugging and optimization purposes, and this function ensures that old data
    does not accumulate indefinitely.
  parameters:
  - name: olderThanMicroseconds
    description: The time threshold in microseconds. Records older than this value
      will be removed from the profiler's internal storage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.FlushOldRecords(60000000); // Remove records older than 60 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Cleanup
    code: "void UpdateAIProfiling()\n{\n    static uint64_t lastCleanup = 0;\n   \
      \ uint64_t currentTime = getTickCount();\n    \n    if (currentTime - lastCleanup\
      \ > 30000000) // Every 30 seconds\n    {\n        aiProfiler.FlushOldRecords(120000000);\
      \ // Keep records from last 2 minutes\n        lastCleanup = currentTime;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically as part of the server's maintenance
    routines to ensure optimal performance. The internal storage mechanism likely
    uses a time-based eviction policy, and calling this function regularly helps maintain
    predictable memory usage patterns.
