  class: Map
  method: GetAreaId
  signature: uint32 Map::GetAreaId(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, const Position &
    pos)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area identifier associated with a given phase shift and position.
  description: This method returns the unique area identifier (ID) for the specified
    phase shift and position within the map. It is commonly used to determine which
    area a player or object belongs to based on their current phase and location.
    The method takes into account both the phase information and spatial coordinates
    to accurately determine the area ID, making it essential for game mechanics involving
    area-based interactions, zone tracking, and phase-aware operations.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: Represents the current phase information of the object or player.
      This includes phase masks and other relevant phase data that affects area determination.
  - name: pos
    description: The spatial position coordinates (X, Y, Z) used to determine the
      area ID. This is typically used in conjunction with phase information to accurately
      locate the area within the map.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the area identifier associated with the provided
    phase shift and position. If no valid area is found, it may return 0 or a default
    value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 areaId = map->GetAreaId(phaseShift, pos);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with phase and position
    code: 'PhaseShift phase = player->GetPhaseShift();

      Position pos = player->GetPosition();

      uint32 areaId = map->GetAreaId(phase, pos);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other phase-aware methods
    to determine zone or area information. Performance considerations may arise when
    using this method frequently during movement updates or in high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as incorrect phase or position
    data can lead to invalid area IDs. Ensure that the phaseShift and Position parameters
    are properly initialized before calling this method.
