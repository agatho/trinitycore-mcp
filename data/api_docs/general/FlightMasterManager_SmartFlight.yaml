  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: SmartFlight
  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::SmartFlight(Creature * flightMaster)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a smart flight path for the specified flight master creature.
  description: The SmartFlight method is responsible for determining and executing
    an appropriate flight path for a given flight master creature. It evaluates the
    current state of the flight master, including its location, available destinations,
    and player context to establish a suitable route. This method typically handles
    the logic for selecting the correct flight path based on player requirements,
    such as destination city or zone, and ensures that the flight master can properly
    navigate to the selected waypoint. The method may also manage any necessary pre-flight
    checks, such as verifying that the player has the required flight paths or mounts
    unlocked.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid flight path was successfully initiated for the
    flight master, false otherwise. A return value of false could indicate that no
    suitable flight path exists, the flight master is in an invalid state, or the
    player context does not allow for flight initiation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with a flight master
    code: "Creature* flightMaster = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nif (FlightMasterManager::SmartFlight(flightMaster))\
      \ {\n    // Flight path initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Flight\
      \ path started for flight master.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate flight\
      \ path\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to start flight path for flight master.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player interaction with a flight master
    NPC. It relies on internal flight path data structures and may involve complex
    state management. The implementation likely includes checks for player quest progress,
    faction status, and available flight paths to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the flight master creature passed to this method is valid
    and properly initialized before calling SmartFlight. Calling this method with
    an invalid or uninitialized creature pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
