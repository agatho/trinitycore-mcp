  method: IsRaid
  signature: bool MapEntry::IsRaid() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a raid instance.
  description: The IsRaid method checks if the current MapEntry object corresponds
    to a raid-type map, such as a dungeon or raid instance. This is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to differentiate between normal, heroic, and raid difficulties
    for content scaling and player experience. The method evaluates internal flags
    or properties of the map entry to determine if it should be treated as a raid
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a raid instance (e.g., a 10-player
    or 25-player dungeon/raid), and false otherwise. This value is typically derived
    from the map's difficulty settings or flags stored in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry is a Raid
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry && entry->IsRaid())\
      \ {\n    // Handle raid-specific logic\n    printf(\"This map is a raid instance.\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-raid logic\n    printf(\"This map is not\
      \ a raid instance.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map flags or difficulty settings that are
    typically defined in the game's database or configuration files. It may be used
    in conjunction with other methods like GetMapDifficulty() to determine the exact
    type of raid instance.
