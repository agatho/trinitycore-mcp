documentation:
  brief: Returns the kiting range specific to a player's class for combat mechanics.
  description: The GetClassKitingRange method retrieves the default kiting range associated
    with a given player class. In World of Warcraft's combat system, kiting refers
    to the ability to maintain distance from enemies while dealing damage, and this
    value determines how far a player can effectively attack from without losing combat
    engagement. This method is typically used by AI systems or game logic to determine
    optimal positioning for different classes during combat scenarios. The returned
    float value represents the range in yards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the kiting range in yards specific to the player
    class. This value is typically between 5.0 and 30.0 yards depending on the class,
    with melee classes generally having shorter ranges and ranged classes having longer
    ranges.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint8 playerClass = CLASS_WARRIOR;

      float kitingRange = KitingUtils::GetClassKitingRange(playerClass);

      // Returns approximately 5.0 yards for Warriors'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Class Detection
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();

      float range = KitingUtils::GetClassKitingRange(playerClass);

      // Use range for AI movement or combat positioning logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal class-to-range mappings defined in TrinityCore's
    configuration or hardcoded values. The kiting range is used primarily for AI decision
    making and pathfinding rather than direct player interaction, though it may influence
    certain combat behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerClass parameter is a valid class identifier (0-11)
    as defined by TrinityCore's class constants, otherwise behavior is undefined.
    This method should not be called with invalid class values to prevent unexpected
    results.
