  class: WorldSession
  method: SendAuctionHello
  signature: void WorldSession::SendAuctionHello(int guid, const Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an auction hello packet to the player, initiating communication with
    an auctioneer NPC.
  description: The SendAuctionHello method is used by the WorldSession class to send
    an auction hello packet to a connected player. This packet notifies the client
    that the player has interacted with an auctioneer NPC and allows the client to
    display the auction house interface. The method takes a GUID identifier for the
    auctioneer and a pointer to the Unit representing that auctioneer. It is typically
    called when a player interacts with an auction house NPC to open the auction interface.
    This method does not return any value but directly sends data over the network
    to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the auctioneer NPC that the player
      is interacting with. This GUID identifies which specific auction house NPC the
      player has approached.
  - name: unit
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the auctioneer NPC. This
      parameter provides additional context about the auctioneer, such as its type
      and state, though it may not be directly used in the packet construction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void HandleAuctionInteraction(WorldSession* session, int auctioneerGuid,\
      \ const Unit* auctioneerUnit)\n{\n    session->SendAuctionHello(auctioneerGuid,\
      \ auctioneerUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Auction Interaction Handler
    code: "void Player::OnAuctionHouseInteract(int auctioneerGuid)\n{\n    if (GetSession())\n\
      \    {\n        Unit* auctioneer = GetMap()->GetUnit(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Unit,\
      \ auctioneerGuid));\n        if (auctioneer)\n        {\n            GetSession()->SendAuctionHello(auctioneerGuid,\
      \ auctioneer);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the auction house system in TrinityCore and is typically
    invoked automatically when a player interacts with an auction house NPC. The packet
    sent by this method enables the client to properly display the auction interface.
    It's important to ensure that the GUID and Unit parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid data could cause client-side issues or disconnects.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the GUID and Unit parameters
    may result in undefined behavior or client disconnection. Ensure that the auctioneer
    NPC exists and is properly initialized before sending the hello packet. This method
    should only be called when a player is actually interacting with an auction house
    NPC, not during other types of interactions.
