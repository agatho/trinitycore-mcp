  signature: uint32 MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::GetOptimalTracking() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal tracking value for a marksmanship hunter
    based on current talent points, gear, and combat state.
  description: The GetOptimalTracking method determines the most effective tracking
    value that a marksmanship hunter should use in their current situation. This value
    is derived from analyzing the hunter's active talents, equipped weapons and gear,
    current target type, and combat conditions. The method considers factors such
    as the hunter's level, specialization-specific abilities, and any applicable buffs
    or debuffs. It returns a uint32 value representing the optimal tracking setting
    that maximizes damage output or accuracy depending on the specific context. This
    method is typically used internally by the AI system to make tactical decisions
    about when and how to apply tracking mechanics during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the optimal tracking setting for the marksmanship
    hunter. The exact numerical value depends on the hunter's current state, talents,
    gear, and target characteristics. This value is used by the game engine to configure
    tracking behavior for the hunter's abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 optimalTracking = hunter.GetOptimalTracking();\nif (optimalTracking\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply tracking configuration\n    player->SetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_TRACKING,\
      \ optimalTracking);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    uint32 tracking\
      \ = GetOptimalTracking();\n    if (tracking != currentTracking)\n    {\n   \
      \     ApplyTrackingSettings(tracking);\n        currentTracking = tracking;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it needs to evaluate multiple
    factors including talent trees, gear stats, and combat state. It should be called
    sparingly during active combat to avoid performance degradation. The returned
    value may change dynamically based on target movement, player buffs, or environmental
    conditions.
  warnings: The method assumes the hunter object is in a valid state with proper initialization
    of talents and gear. Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured
    hunter instance could lead to incorrect tracking values. The returned tracking
    value should not be used directly without proper validation against the game's
    tracking system limits.
