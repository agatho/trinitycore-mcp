  class: StatPriority
  method: StatPriority
  signature: void StatPriority::StatPriority(uint8 cls, uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes stat priority settings for a specified class and specialization.
  description: The StatPriority::StatPriority method sets up internal stat priority
    configurations based on the provided class and specialization identifiers. This
    method is typically used during player initialization or spec switching to configure
    how attributes like Strength, Agility, Intellect, etc., are prioritized for stat
    allocation and calculation. The method likely interacts with TrinityCore's internal
    talent and stat management systems to ensure proper stat distribution according
    to the selected class and spec. It does not return any value but modifies internal
    state variables within the StatPriority class.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier (0-11) representing the player's class. Valid
      values correspond to TrinityCore's class constants such as WARRIOR = 1, PALADIN
      = 2, etc.
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization identifier (0-3) representing the player's current
      spec within the class. Valid values are 0-3 for each class's available specializations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize stat priorities for a warrior with Arms specialization
    code: 'StatPriority priority;

      priority.StatPriority(1, 0); // Warrior (class 1), Arms spec (spec 0)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set stat priorities for a mage with Fire specialization
    code: 'StatPriority priority;

      priority.StatPriority(8, 2); // Mage (class 8), Fire spec (spec 2)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes internal lookup tables or configuration structures
    that determine how stats are weighted for various calculations. It may be called
    automatically during player login or when switching specs, but can also be invoked
    manually in custom scripts or addons. The exact implementation details depend
    on TrinityCore's stat management system and may vary between different core versions.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid class and spec parameters
    to avoid undefined behavior. Invalid values may cause internal configuration corruption
    or incorrect stat calculations. Ensure proper initialization order when using
    this in custom modules.
