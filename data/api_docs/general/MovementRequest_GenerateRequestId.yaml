  class: MovementRequest
  method: GenerateRequestId
  signature: uint64 MovementRequest::GenerateRequestId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique request identifier for movement-related operations within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The GenerateRequestId method creates and returns a unique 64-bit identifier
    that is used to track individual movement requests in the game world. This ID
    is typically utilized by the movement system to correlate client requests with
    server responses, ensuring proper handling of player or creature movement commands.
    The generated ID is guaranteed to be unique within the scope of the current server
    instance and is often employed in conjunction with movement handlers and packet
    processing logic. This method does not require any input parameters and is designed
    to be called whenever a new movement request needs to be initiated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier for the movement
    request. This value should be used to track and correlate movement-related operations
    throughout the game's movement system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Handler
    code: 'uint64 requestId = movementRequest.GenerateRequestId();

      // Store the ID for later correlation with response handling

      movementHandler.AddPendingRequest(requestId, playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is likely implemented using an internal counter or timestamp-based
    generation to ensure uniqueness. It's important to note that this ID should not
    be reused for different requests to maintain proper tracking of movement operations.
