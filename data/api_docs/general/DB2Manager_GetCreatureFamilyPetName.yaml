  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetCreatureFamilyPetName
  signature: const char * DB2Manager::GetCreatureFamilyPetName(uint32 petfamily, LocaleConstant
    locale)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized pet name for a given creature family ID and locale.
  description: The GetCreatureFamilyPetName method fetches the localized name of a
    pet associated with a specific creature family ID. This is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft to display proper names for companion pets such as cats, dogs, birds,
    or other summoned creatures. The method utilizes the DB2 database files which
    contain localized string data and requires a valid locale constant to return the
    appropriate translation. It's typically called when displaying pet names in UI
    elements like pet journals or during pet summoning events.
  parameters:
  - name: petfamily
    description: The creature family ID that identifies the type of pet (e.g., 1 for
      cats, 2 for dogs, etc.). This value corresponds to entries in the CreatureFamily.db2
      file.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant enum value indicating which language version of
      the name to retrieve. Valid values include LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, LOCALE_frFR,
      etc., depending on the client's localization settings.
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character string containing the localized
    pet name for the specified creature family and locale. Returns NULL if no entry
    exists for the given petfamily/locale combination or if the input parameters are
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Pet Name for Cat Family
    code: "const char* catName = sDB2Manager->GetCreatureFamilyPetName(1, LOCALE_enUS);\n\
      if (catName)\n{\n    printf(\"Pet name: %s\\n\", catName);\n}\nelse\n{\n   \
      \ printf(\"No pet name found for family 1.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use with Dynamic Locale Selection
    code: "LocaleConstant currentLocale = GetSession()->GetSessionDbcLocale();\nconst\
      \ char* petName = sDB2Manager->GetCreatureFamilyPetName(5, currentLocale);\n\
      if (petName)\n{\n    // Display localized pet name in UI\n    SendPetNameUpdate(petName);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the DB2Manager's internal data structures that are
    populated at server startup from the DB2 files. The returned string is managed
    by the DB2Manager and should not be freed by the caller. Performance is optimized
    through internal caching mechanisms, but repeated calls with different locales
    may cause additional lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the petfamily parameter corresponds to valid entries in CreatureFamily.db2;
    invalid IDs will return NULL. Also note that some creature families might not
    have localized names defined for all locales, resulting in NULL returns even when
    the ID is valid.
