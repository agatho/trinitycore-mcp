  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadAccountToys(int result)
documentation:
  brief: Loads account-level toy data for all players from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadAccountToys method retrieves and initializes toy collection
    data associated with each player's account from the database. This method is typically
    invoked during server startup or when a player logs in to ensure their toy collection
    state is properly loaded. It processes the database results to populate internal
    collections and ensures that players can access their toy data within the game
    environment. The method handles the mapping of toy IDs to player accounts and
    prepares the data structures necessary for toy-related game mechanics such as
    toy usage, display, and progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeCollections()\n{\n    sCollectionMgr->LoadAccountToys(0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the CollectionMgr system and
    should not typically be invoked directly by other subsystems. It assumes that
    database connections are already established and that the relevant tables contain
    valid data. Performance may be impacted during server startup if a large number
    of players have accumulated toys.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand its internal workings
    and dependencies. Improper usage can lead to memory leaks or inconsistent toy
    state across players.
