  method: InitializeShamanBaseline
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializeShamanBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation for shaman players with default spell priorities
    and combat behavior settings.
  description: The InitializeShamanBaseline method sets up the foundational spell
    rotation logic specifically designed for shaman class characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method configures default priority lists for offensive and defensive
    spells, establishes baseline combat behaviors such as mana management strategies,
    and initializes core rotation parameters that govern how a shaman AI will prioritize
    actions during combat encounters. The initialization process ensures that all
    shaman-specific mechanics are properly configured before any combat decisions
    are made, including handling of elemental, enhancement, and restoration specializations.
    This method is typically invoked during the creation or reset phase of a shaman
    AI instance to prepare it for engagement in various combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeShamanBaseline();

      // The shaman baseline rotation is now configured with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a shaman AI instance. It modifies internal state variables that affect spell selection
    and timing decisions. The method does not perform any external API calls or database
    operations, making it safe for use in performance-critical contexts.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times on the same instance without proper
    cleanup, as it may lead to inconsistent rotation behavior. This method assumes
    that the underlying player object has been properly initialized with shaman class
    data before execution.
