  signature: std::string CalendarEvent::GetTitle() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the title of the calendar event
  description: The GetTitle method returns the human-readable title string associated
    with a calendar event. This title is typically displayed in the game's calendar
    interface and represents the name or description of the event. The returned string
    is a copy of the internal title data, ensuring that modifications to the returned
    value do not affect the original event object. Calendar events in TrinityCore
    are used for organizing guild activities, raids, social gatherings, and other
    in-game occurrences that players can RSVP to or view on their calendar.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the title of the calendar event. Returns an empty
    string if no title has been set or if the event is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display calendar event title
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    std::string title = event->GetTitle();\n    if (!title.empty())\n     \
      \   TC_LOG_INFO(\"calendar\", \"Event Title: %s\", title.c_str());\n    else\n\
      \        TC_LOG_INFO(\"calendar\", \"Event has no title set\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a copy of the internal string data, so changes to the
    returned string will not affect the original event. This is a const method and
    does not modify any member variables.
