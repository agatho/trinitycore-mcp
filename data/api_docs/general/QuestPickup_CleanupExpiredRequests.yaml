  method: CleanupExpiredRequests
  signature: void QuestPickup::CleanupExpiredRequests()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired quest pickup requests from the internal tracking system.
  description: The CleanupExpiredRequests method iterates through all active quest
    pickup requests and removes those that have exceeded their valid time window.
    This ensures that stale or abandoned quest interactions do not clutter the system
    and consume unnecessary resources. The method is typically invoked periodically
    by the game loop to maintain system efficiency and prevent memory leaks from unprocessed
    requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n    questPickup.CleanupExpiredRequests();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game thread and should
    not be invoked concurrently. It performs a linear scan of active requests, so
    performance may degrade with a large number of pending quest pickups.
