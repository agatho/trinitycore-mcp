  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: Stop
  signature: void DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::Stop()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the double-buffered spatial grid processing and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The Stop method halts all active operations within the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid,
    including any ongoing spatial indexing or grid update processes. It ensures that
    no further grid updates are performed and releases any allocated memory or resources
    used by the grid. This method is typically called during shutdown or when transitioning
    between different game states where spatial grid functionality is no longer required.
    The method performs necessary cleanup to prevent memory leaks and ensure thread
    safety during shutdown sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shutdown Sequence
    code: "void GameWorld::Shutdown()\n{\n    // Stop spatial grid processing before\
      \ shutting down\n    m_spatialGrid->Stop();\n    \n    // Proceed with other\
      \ shutdown tasks\n    CleanupResources();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    with other grid operations. It's recommended to call Stop() before destroying
    the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance to ensure proper resource deallocation.
  warnings: Calling Stop() while the grid is actively processing spatial updates may
    result in incomplete operations. Ensure all pending operations are completed or
    canceled before invoking this method.
