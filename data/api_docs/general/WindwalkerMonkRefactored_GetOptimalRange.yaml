  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float WindwalkerMonkRefactored::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the Windwalker Monk based
    on target state and current abilities.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which the
    Windwalker Monk should engage a target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the target's current health, positioning,
    available abilities like Spinning Crane Kick or Tiger Palm, and environmental
    constraints within the game world. The returned float value represents the distance
    in yards from the monk to the target where engagement is considered optimal. This
    method is typically used by AI decision-making systems to determine when and how
    to approach targets during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. Returns 0.0f
    if no valid target exists or if the calculation cannot be performed due to invalid
    state conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "float optimalRange = monk->GetOptimalRange();\nif (optimalRange > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Move towards target until within optimal range\n    player->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining with Target Analysis
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\n{\n    float\
      \ range = monk->GetOptimalRange();\n    float currentDistance = player->GetDistance(target);\n\
      \    \n    if (currentDistance > range)\n        player->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ range);\n    else if (currentDistance < range * 0.8f)\n        player->MoveAwayFrom(target,\
      \ range);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally evaluates the monk's current stance, available abilities,
    and target characteristics to compute an optimal engagement distance. It may return
    different values depending on whether the monk is in combat or not, and it considers
    both melee and ranged attack capabilities of the Windwalker Monk specialization.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid target exists and that the monk's state is
    properly initialized. Calling this method without a proper target context may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect range calculations. Ensure that target
    validity checks are performed before invoking this method.
