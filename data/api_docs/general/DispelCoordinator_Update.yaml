documentation:
  brief: Updates the dispel coordinator's internal state and processes pending dispel
    operations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the DispelCoordinator, typically called once per game tick to handle time-based
    dispel mechanics. It processes any queued dispel effects, checks for expiration
    conditions, and manages the lifecycle of dispel-related data structures. This
    method ensures that dispel operations are properly synchronized with the game's
    update cycle and maintains consistency in spell effect management across all active
    dispels.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    m_dispelCoordinator.Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure proper
    dispel handling. The 'diff' parameter represents the time elapsed since last update
    in milliseconds, which is crucial for accurate timing of dispel effects.
