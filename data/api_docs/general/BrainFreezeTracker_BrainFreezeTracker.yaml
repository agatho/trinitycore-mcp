documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BrainFreezeTracker instance with default values.
  description: The BrainFreezeTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BrainFreezeTracker class. This class is designed to track the Brain Freeze buff
    state for players in the context of the Frost Mage specialization in World of
    Warcraft. The tracker manages the internal state of whether a player currently
    has the Brain Freeze effect active, which prevents them from casting certain spells
    while the buff is applied. The constructor sets up default values for tracking
    variables and ensures proper initialization before any tracking operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BrainFreezeTracker instance
    code: 'BrainFreezeTracker tracker;

      // Initializes a new tracker with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when creating
    spell effect instances or player aura tracking systems. Developers should not
    directly instantiate this class unless implementing custom spell handling logic.
