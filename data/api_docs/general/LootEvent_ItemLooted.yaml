documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a LootEvent object representing an item looted by a player
    in World of Warcraft
  description: The ItemLooted method is a static factory function that constructs
    and returns a LootEvent object to represent the event when a player successfully
    loots an item from a creature, game object, or quest. This method encapsulates
    all relevant information about the loot action including the looter's identifier,
    item details, quantity, and loot type. The returned LootEvent can be used for
    event handling, logging, or triggering custom behaviors within the TrinityCore
    server framework. This function is typically invoked during the loot processing
    phase of game mechanics when items are distributed to players.
  parameters:
  - name: looter
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who looted the item, represented
      as an integer
  - name: item
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the specific item that was looted,
      represented as an integer
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the item template, used to identify the type and
      properties of the item being looted
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of items looted, represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer
      (typically 1 for single items)
  - name: type
    description: The LootType enum value indicating the source and method of loot
      distribution (e.g., from creature, game object, or quest)
  returns: A LootEvent object representing the item looting event with all provided
    parameters properly set
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Looting Event Creation
    code: LootEvent event = LootEvent::ItemLooted(12345, 67890, 1234, 1, LOOT_CREATURE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Item Looting Event for Stackable Items
    code: LootEvent event = LootEvent::ItemLooted(54321, 98765, 5678, 5, LOOT_GAMEOBJECT);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used within the TrinityCore server's loot system
    and should only be called during appropriate loot processing phases. The returned
    LootEvent object is typically passed to event handlers or stored for later processing.
    It's important to note that this function doesn't actually perform the looting
    action itself, but rather creates an event representation of it.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method; invalid
    GUIDs or entry IDs may cause unexpected behavior in event handling systems. The
    LootType parameter must be one of the predefined values from the LootType enum
    to ensure proper event routing and processing.
