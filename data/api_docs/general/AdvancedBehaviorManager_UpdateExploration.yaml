  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: UpdateExploration
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::UpdateExploration(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the exploration state for all active behaviors in the manager.
  description: The UpdateExploration method is responsible for processing and updating
    the exploration behavior of all active AI units managed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
    This method typically handles tasks such as detecting new areas, updating exploration
    flags, and managing the exploration state transitions for NPCs or players under
    advanced AI control. It is designed to be called regularly during the game loop
    to ensure that exploration behaviors remain synchronized with the current world
    state. The method uses the provided time delta (diff) parameter to calculate time-based
    updates and ensure smooth behavior execution.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to calculate time-based behavior updates and ensure consistent timing
      across different system performance conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateExploration Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateExploration(diff);\n\
      \    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "class MyAIUpdateSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n\
      \        // Perform regular AI updates\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateExploration(diff);\n\
      \        \n        // Additional behavior-specific logic\n        // ...\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from the main game loop or a dedicated AI update
    thread. The diff parameter must be accurately calculated to ensure proper time-based
    behavior updates. The implementation may internally manage multiple exploration
    states for different AI units and should handle concurrent access if used in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or zero time deltas, as it may cause
    unexpected behavior in time-sensitive exploration logic. Ensure that the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
