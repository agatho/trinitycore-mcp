  signature: void BotDatabasePool::StopWorkerThreads()
documentation:
  brief: Stops all worker threads in the bot database connection pool.
  description: The StopWorkerThreads method gracefully terminates all active worker
    threads that are managing database connections within the BotDatabasePool. This
    method ensures that no further database operations are processed by these threads
    and allows for clean shutdown of the database pool. It is typically invoked during
    system shutdown or when reconfiguring the database connection settings. The method
    does not return any value and should only be called when it's safe to terminate
    ongoing database operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().StopWorkerThreads();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that no database transactions are currently in progress.
    It is recommended to call this method after ensuring all pending operations have
    been completed or canceled. The worker threads will be terminated in a controlled
    manner, but any ongoing queries may be interrupted.
