  class: DungeonScript
  method: HandleGroundAvoidance
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandleGroundAvoidance(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Handles ground avoidance mechanics for player and boss entities within dungeon
    scripts.
  description: The HandleGroundAvoidance method is responsible for managing collision
    avoidance behaviors between players and bosses in dungeon environments. This method
    typically adjusts movement patterns or positioning to prevent entities from penetrating
    terrain or overlapping with obstacles. It operates on integer pointers representing
    player and boss states, likely updating their positions or movement flags to maintain
    proper spatial relationships. The method is commonly used in scripted encounters
    where precise positioning and collision handling are critical for gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's current state or
      position data for ground avoidance calculations.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's current state or position
      data for ground avoidance calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Script
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnBossEngage()\n{\n    int playerState = GetPlayer()->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_PLAYER_FLAGS);\n\
      \    int bossState = GetBoss()->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS);\n    HandleGroundAvoidance(&playerState,\
      \ &bossState);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the referenced integer values to reflect updated
    positioning or movement flags. The implementation may involve collision detection
    algorithms or spatial partitioning techniques to ensure proper avoidance behavior.
  warnings: Care must be taken when passing pointers to this method as incorrect handling
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the integer values pointed to are
    valid and properly initialized before calling this method.
