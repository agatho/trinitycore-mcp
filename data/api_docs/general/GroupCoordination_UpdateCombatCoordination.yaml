documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat coordination state for group members.
  description: The UpdateCombatCoordination method synchronizes the current combat
    status and positioning of all group members within a coordinated combat scenario.
    This method ensures that all players in the group maintain consistent combat states,
    including engagement with enemies, positioning, and cooldown synchronization.
    It is typically invoked during combat events to maintain group coordination and
    prevent desynchronization between players' actions. The method does not require
    any parameters as it operates on the internal state of the GroupCoordination object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    groupCoordination->UpdateCombatCoordination();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during active combat scenarios
    to maintain synchronization. It may internally trigger updates to player states,
    cooldowns, and positioning data within the group.
