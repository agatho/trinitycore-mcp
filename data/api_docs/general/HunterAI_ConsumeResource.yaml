  class: HunterAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void HunterAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the required resource cost for a specified hunter spell.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the necessary
    resources (such as focus, energy, or mana) from the hunter's current resource
    pool when a spell is cast. This method ensures that the hunter has sufficient
    resources before allowing the spell to be executed, and it updates the hunter's
    resource state accordingly. It typically gets invoked during spell execution logic
    within the HunterAI class to enforce resource management rules consistent with
    World of Warcraft's gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which resources should be
      consumed. This ID corresponds to a specific hunter spell defined in the game's
      spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyHunterAI::CastSpell(int spellId)\n{\n    // Check if we have enough\
      \ resources\n    if (HasSufficientResources(spellId))\n    {\n        // Consume\
      \ the required resources\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        \n    \
      \    // Proceed with casting the spell\n        DoCast(spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal resource tracking mechanisms and
    may trigger updates to the UI or game state. It is expected to be called only
    after verifying that the spell can be cast, typically as part of a larger spell
    execution flow.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without prior validation of available resources
    could lead to invalid game states or client-server desynchronization in multiplayer
    environments.
