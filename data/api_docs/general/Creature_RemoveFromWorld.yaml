documentation:
  brief: Removes the creature from the game world by unregistering it from the world
    object manager.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method unregisters the creature from the WorldObjectManager,
    effectively removing it from the active game world. This method is typically called
    when a creature needs to be destroyed or when it's being removed from the world
    for any reason. The creature will no longer be visible to players and will not
    participate in any game mechanics until it is re-added to the world. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of the creature's presence in the world.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      // ... code to initialize creature ...

      creature->RemoveFromWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying the creature object to prevent
    memory leaks. It's important to note that calling this method does not immediately
    delete the creature; it merely removes it from the world's active objects.
