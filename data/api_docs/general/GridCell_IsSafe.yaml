  class: GridCell
  method: IsSafe
  signature: bool GridCell::IsSafe() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the grid cell is considered safe for player activity.
  description: The IsSafe method checks if a GridCell is in a safe state, typically
    meaning it does not contain hostile creatures or dangerous conditions that would
    prevent player movement or interaction. This method is used by the game engine
    to evaluate the safety of areas within the world grid system. The implementation
    likely considers factors such as player presence, creature types, and environmental
    hazards within the cell's boundaries. It serves as a key component in pathfinding
    and player safety systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the grid cell is considered safe for player activity, false
    otherwise. A safe cell typically means no hostile creatures are present or active
    within the cell that would pose an immediate threat to players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Movement
    code: "if (gridCell.IsSafe()) {\n    // Allow player to move into this grid cell\n\
      \    player->MoveTo(gridCell.GetPosition());\n} else {\n    // Find an alternative\
      \ path or warn the player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"This area is unsafe!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Zone Validation in AI Pathfinding
    code: "bool isValidPath = true;\nfor (auto& cell : pathCells) {\n    if (!cell.IsSafe())\
      \ {\n        isValidPath = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (isValidPath)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with the path\n    agent->FollowPath(pathCells);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during game updates and pathfinding
    operations. Performance optimization may be important as it could be invoked many
    times per second. The exact safety criteria are implementation-specific but generally
    involve checking for hostile NPCs, dangerous terrain, or other environmental factors.
  warnings: Do not assume all grid cells are safe without calling this method. Using
    unsafe cells for player movement can result in unexpected combat encounters or
    game-breaking situations. This method should not be used as a sole determinant
    of player safety in critical systems.
