  signature: bool EmpowermentController::ShouldReleaseSpell()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell should be released based on empowerment state
    and conditions.
  description: The ShouldReleaseSpell method evaluates the current empowerment state
    of a unit to determine if a spell can be released or should remain in an empowered
    state. This method is typically used in conjunction with spell empowerment mechanics
    where spells may need to be held until certain conditions are met, such as reaching
    a specific empowerment threshold or waiting for a cooldown period. The method
    checks internal state flags and empowerment counters to make this determination.
    It's commonly invoked during spell casting logic to control when empowered spells
    can actually be cast rather than just being in an empowered state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell should be released and can proceed with casting,
    false if the spell should remain in its empowered state or cannot be released
    at this time. The return value indicates whether the empowerment conditions have
    been satisfied to allow spell execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell casting logic
    code: "if (empowermentController->ShouldReleaseSpell()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal spell casting\n    unit->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Keep spell in empowered state\n    unit->SendSpellGo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with empowerment handler
    code: "void Unit::HandleEmpowermentRelease() {\n    if (empowermentController\
      \ && empowermentController->ShouldReleaseSpell()) {\n        // Release empowered\
      \ spell\n        CastEmpoweredSpell();\n        ResetEmpowerment();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Continue empowerment buildup\n        UpdateEmpowerment();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal empowerment counters and state
    machines. It's important to understand that returning true doesn't guarantee spell
    casting will succeed - other factors like line of sight, target validity, and
    cooldowns may still prevent actual spell execution. The method should be called
    regularly during empowerment buildup phases to properly manage spell release timing.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of true immediately allows spell casting
    without additional validation. Always perform final spell validation checks before
    executing the actual spell cast. This method may be called frequently during empowerment
    periods, so performance considerations should be taken into account in high-frequency
    scenarios.
