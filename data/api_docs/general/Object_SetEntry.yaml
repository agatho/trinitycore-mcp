  class: Object
  method: SetEntry
  signature: void Object::SetEntry(uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the entry ID of the object, typically used to define the creature or
    item template identifier.
  description: The SetEntry method assigns a specific entry ID to an Object instance,
    which determines the template that defines its properties and behaviors within
    the game world. This method is commonly used for creatures and items to set their
    unique identifiers (entry) that correspond to database entries in the creature
    or item templates. The entry ID directly influences how the object behaves in
    terms of its appearance, loot, AI, and other game mechanics based on the template
    data. This method should be called during object initialization or when changing
    the object's template type.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry) that defines the object's template
      in the database. Valid values are positive integers corresponding to existing
      creature or item templates in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a creature entry
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetEntry(12345);

      // Sets the creature''s template to entry 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting an item entry
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetEntry(54321);

      // Sets the item''s template to entry 54321'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the object's
    behavior and properties. It is typically called during object creation or when
    changing the object's type. The entry ID must match existing database entries
    to ensure proper functionality.
  warnings: Improper use of SetEntry can lead to objects with invalid or non-existent
    templates, causing potential game crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the
    entry value corresponds to valid database entries before calling this method.
