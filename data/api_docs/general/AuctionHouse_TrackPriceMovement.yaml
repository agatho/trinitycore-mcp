api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: TrackPriceMovement
  signature: void AuctionHouse::TrackPriceMovement(uint32 itemId, uint32 price, uint32
    timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks the price movement of an item in the auction house over time.
  description: The TrackPriceMovement method records the price of a specific item
    at a given timestamp within the auction house system. This functionality is typically
    used to monitor market trends, maintain historical pricing data, or support features
    such as price prediction algorithms. The method likely stores this information
    in an internal data structure or database for later retrieval and analysis. It
    does not directly interact with players or auction bids but rather logs transactional
    data for administrative or analytical purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being tracked. This corresponds
      to the ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: price
    description: The current price of the item at the specified timestamp, measured
      in copper (the smallest unit of currency in World of Warcraft).
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the price was recorded. This is
      used to maintain chronological order of price changes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Price Tracking Example
    code: AuctionHouse::TrackPriceMovement(18730, 500000, time(nullptr)); // Records
      that item ID 18730 (e.g., Arcanite Reaper) was priced at 50g at current time
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the auction house's internal logging system
    and may be called automatically during bid events or periodically by a background
    process. Developers should ensure that timestamps are properly synchronized across
    servers if using a distributed auction system.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper validation could lead to incorrect
    historical data being stored, which might affect market analysis tools or pricing
    algorithms. Timestamps must be valid and in the correct format (Unix timestamp).
