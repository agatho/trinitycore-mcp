  signature: const PlayerDataAccount & WorldSession::GetPlayerDataAccount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the player data account associated with this
    session.
  description: The GetPlayerDataAccount method retrieves the PlayerDataAccount object
    that contains account-related information for the player currently logged in through
    this WorldSession. This data typically includes account-level settings, permissions,
    and other metadata that is tied to the player's account rather than their individual
    character. The returned reference is constant, meaning it should not be modified
    directly. This method is commonly used during authentication checks, account validation,
    and when accessing account-specific configuration options within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the PlayerDataAccount object associated with this
    session. This reference provides read-only access to account-level data such as
    account permissions, subscription status, and other account-specific properties.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Account Permissions
    code: "const PlayerDataAccount& account = session->GetPlayerDataAccount();\nif\
      \ (account.HasPermission(\"admin\")) {\n    // Grant admin privileges\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Account Subscription Status
    code: "const PlayerDataAccount& account = session->GetPlayerDataAccount();\nif\
      \ (account.IsPremium()) {\n    // Enable premium features\n    session->SendPremiumFeatureNotification();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the session has been properly initialized with a
    valid player account. The PlayerDataAccount object is typically populated during
    the login process and cached within the session for performance reasons. Accessing
    this data should be thread-safe as long as the session itself is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned PlayerDataAccount reference directly,
    as it's const. Modifications should be made through appropriate setter methods
    or account management APIs. Be aware that accessing this method before a player
    has fully logged in may result in undefined behavior or incomplete data.
