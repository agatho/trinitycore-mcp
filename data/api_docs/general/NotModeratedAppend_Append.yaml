    & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet.
  description: The Append method is used to populate a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with relevant channel-related data. This method is typically invoked when
    sending channel notifications to players, such as join/leave messages, moderation
    status changes, or other channel-specific events. The method modifies the provided
    packet in-place by adding necessary fields and data that represent the current
    state or event related to the channel. It does not perform any validation on the
    input packet but assumes it's properly initialized for channel notifications.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object that
      will be populated with channel notification data. This packet is modified in-place
      and should be sent to the relevant players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for sending a channel join notification
    code: 'NotModeratedAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);

      // Send notifyPacket to players in the channel'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called when preparing channel notifications for transmission.
    The method does not validate whether the packet contains valid data before appending;
    it simply adds the required fields based on the current context.
