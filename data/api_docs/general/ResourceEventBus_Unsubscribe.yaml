  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void ResourceEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the ResourceEventBus event system.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the
    ResourceEventBus, effectively disconnecting it from any resource-related events
    that are broadcast through this event bus. This allows for proper cleanup of AI
    components when they are no longer needed or have been destroyed. The method ensures
    that the subscriber will no longer receive notifications about resource events
    such as item acquisition, gold changes, or other relevant game state updates.
    It is important to call this method before destroying a BotAI instance to prevent
    potential dangling pointers or access violations.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the event
      bus. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... setup and subscribe to events ...

      ResourceEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(myBot);

      delete myBot;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the ResourceEventBus when a
    subscriber is removed, but can also be invoked manually for explicit cleanup.
    The implementation likely uses internal tracking mechanisms to maintain a list
    of active subscribers and efficiently remove entries.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance being unsubscribed has been properly registered
    with the event bus before calling this method.
