documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who owns the item.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the GUID of the player who currently
    owns the item. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to identify the owner of an item, particularly when dealing with player-owned
    items such as weapons, armor, or other equipment. The GUID returned represents
    the unique identifier of the player character, not the item itself. This function
    is essential for determining ownership during item interactions, auction house
    operations, and player trading scenarios. It should be noted that this method
    will return 0 if the item has no owner or if the item is not owned by a player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the player who owns the item.
    If the item has no owner or is not owned by a player, it returns 0. The GUID is
    typically a 64-bit value represented as an integer in C++ code.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* owner = ObjectAccessor::GetPlayer(*ObjectAccessor::GetWorld(),\
      \ item->GetOwnerGUID());\nif (owner)\n{\n    // Do something with the player\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Item owner: \" << owner->GetName() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be used in both single-threaded and multi-threaded
    environments. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight operation that simply returns
    the stored GUID value without any complex computations or memory allocations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with items that may not have an owner,
    such as items sold on the auction house or dropped by NPCs. The method will return
    0 in such cases, which can lead to errors if not properly handled in code.
