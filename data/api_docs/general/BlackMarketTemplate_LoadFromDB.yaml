  class: BlackMarketTemplate
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: bool BlackMarketTemplate::LoadFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads black market template data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves black market template entries from
    the database and populates the internal data structures of the BlackMarketTemplate
    class. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when initializing
    black market data for a specific auction house. It processes database fields to
    construct template information including item IDs, quantities, and other relevant
    properties. The method ensures that all black market templates are properly loaded
    before they can be used in game mechanics such as auction house operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the data was successfully loaded from the database, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate database connection issues, missing
    data, or invalid field formats.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BlackMarketTemplate template;\nbool success = template.LoadFromDB(nullptr);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Template data loaded successfully\n    printf(\"Black\
      \ market template loaded successfully.\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle load\
      \ failure\n    printf(\"Failed to load black market template.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server initialization. It's important to note that this method expects a valid
    database connection and proper field formatting. The method may perform multiple
    database queries depending on the implementation details of the BlackMarketTemplate
    class.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal structure
    of the BlackMarketTemplate class. Improper usage may lead to data corruption or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the database connection is properly established
    before invoking this method.
