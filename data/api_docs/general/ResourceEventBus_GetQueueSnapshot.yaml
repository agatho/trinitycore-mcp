  signature: int ResourceEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of queued resource events in the EventBus.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method provides a snapshot of the current queue
    size for resource events within the ResourceEventBus. This method is typically
    used for monitoring, debugging, or performance analysis purposes to understand
    how many events are currently pending processing. The returned value represents
    the count of events waiting in the internal queue and can be useful for determining
    system load or identifying potential bottlenecks in event handling. This operation
    does not modify the queue state and is generally safe to call from any thread
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of resource events currently queued
    for processing. A return value of zero indicates no pending events, while a positive
    integer reflects the count of queued items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int queuedEvents = eventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queuedEvents > 100)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"High event queue detected: %d events\
      \ queued\", queuedEvents);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on the internal queue state and
    should not block or cause significant overhead. It is recommended for periodic
    monitoring rather than frequent polling in performance-critical sections.
