documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CreatureTextMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the CreatureTextMgr
    class, providing global access to the manager responsible for handling creature
    text entries and their associated dialogue systems. This manager is crucial for
    managing NPC conversations, quest-related dialogues, and creature-specific text
    events within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that only one instance
    of CreatureTextMgr exists throughout the application lifecycle, making it thread-safe
    for concurrent access by various subsystems such as AI modules, quest handlers,
    and player interaction systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of CreatureTextMgr. The returned pointer
    is never null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing CreatureTextMgr Singleton
    code: 'CreatureTextMgr* textManager = CreatureTextMgr::instance();

      // Use the manager to access creature text data

      uint32 textId = textManager->GetCreatureText(12345, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Singleton in AI Context
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnTalk(Player*\
      \ player) override {\n        CreatureTextMgr* mgr = CreatureTextMgr::instance();\n\
      \        // Access text data for creature dialogue\n        mgr->SendCreatureText(this->GetCreature(),\
      \ 12345, player);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The CreatureTextMgr
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains active throughout
    the server's runtime. Developers should not attempt to manually create or destroy
    instances of this class as it violates the singleton contract.
