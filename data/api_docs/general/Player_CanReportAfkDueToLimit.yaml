  class: Player
  method: CanReportAfkDueToLimit
  signature: bool Player::CanReportAfkDueToLimit()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can report AFK status due to time limit restrictions.
  description: This method checks if a player is allowed to report their AFK status
    based on the current time limit restrictions set by the game mechanics. It evaluates
    whether the player's AFK status can be reported without violating any time-based
    limitations or rules imposed by the server. The method typically involves checking
    against internal AFK reporting limits and may consider factors such as the last
    AFK report timestamp, time elapsed since last report, and server-specific AFK
    policies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can report AFK status due to time limit restrictions,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when the player is not allowed to report
    AFK due to time constraints or when the time limit has not been met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AFK Reporting Check
    code: "if (player->CanReportAfkDueToLimit()) {\n    // Player can report AFK\n\
      \    player->SetAFK(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AFK-related methods
    to determine if a player's AFK status can be reported. It may involve internal
    server time tracking and should be used carefully when implementing AFK reporting
    logic.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a standalone check for AFK reporting;
    it must be combined with other AFK-related checks to ensure proper game mechanics
    behavior. Using this method without considering time limits may lead to incorrect
    AFK status reporting.
