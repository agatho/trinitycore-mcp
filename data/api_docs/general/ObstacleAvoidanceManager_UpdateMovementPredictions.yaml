documentation:
  brief: Updates internal movement predictions for obstacle avoidance calculations
  description: The UpdateMovementPredictions method recalculates and refreshes movement
    predictions used by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager to determine safe paths for units.
    This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that the system
    has the most current information about potential obstacles, unit positions, and
    movement trajectories. It processes the current state of nearby entities and their
    predicted movements to generate avoidance behaviors that prevent units from colliding
    with static or dynamic obstacles in the game world.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_obstacleAvoidanceManager->UpdateMovementPredictions();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with movement logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    accurate obstacle avoidance behavior. The implementation likely involves processing
    a list of nearby units, calculating their predicted positions over time, and building
    internal data structures for collision detection.
