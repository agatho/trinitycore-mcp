    uint64_t duration, uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Records a function call duration for profiling bot performance
  description: The RecordFunctionCall method logs timing data for specific function
    executions within the bot system. This method is used by the BotProfiler class
    to track how long various bot operations take, which helps in identifying performance
    bottlenecks and optimizing bot behavior. The recorded data includes the function
    name, execution duration in microseconds, and the unique identifier of the bot
    that executed the function. This profiling information is crucial for maintaining
    optimal performance in World of Warcraft's bot system, especially when dealing
    with large numbers of bots performing complex AI behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: functionName
    description: The name of the function being recorded, typically a string identifier
      that uniquely represents the operation performed by the bot
  - name: duration
    description: The execution time of the function in microseconds (uint64_t), representing
      how long the function took to complete
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (uint32_t) of the bot that executed
      the function, used to associate timing data with specific bot instances
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Function Call Recording
    code: BotProfiler::RecordFunctionCall("BotAI::Update", 1500, 12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Bot Operations
    code: 'uint64_t startTime = getTickCount();

      // Perform some bot AI operation

      bot->MoveTo(target);

      uint64_t endTime = getTickCount();

      BotProfiler::RecordFunctionCall("BotAI::MoveTo", endTime - startTime, bot->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot system's profiling
    mechanisms. The duration parameter should be measured using high-resolution timing
    functions to ensure accuracy. All recorded data is stored in memory until explicitly
    flushed or processed by the profiler, so frequent calls may impact performance
    if not managed properly.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., zero duration or invalid
    bot GUID) may result in incorrect profiling data. Ensure that function names are
    consistent across calls to enable meaningful aggregation and analysis of profiling
    results.
