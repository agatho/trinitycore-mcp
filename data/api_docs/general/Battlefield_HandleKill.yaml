  class: Battlefield
  method: HandleKill
  signature: void Battlefield::HandleKill(Player * param0, Unit * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a player kill event within the battlefield context, updating scores
    and handling win conditions.
  description: The HandleKill method is responsible for managing the logic that occurs
    when a player successfully kills another unit within a battlefield scenario. This
    includes updating player and team scores, checking for win conditions, and potentially
    triggering victory announcements or reward distributions. The method typically
    integrates with the broader battlefield management system to ensure proper tracking
    of combat outcomes and game state progression. It is designed to be called internally
    by the game engine upon detection of a kill event, and may perform various administrative
    tasks such as updating player statistics, checking for objective completions,
    and notifying relevant subsystems about the kill.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who performed the kill. This parameter
      represents the aggressor in the kill event.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was killed. This parameter represents
      the target of the kill event, which may be a player or NPC.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Kill Event Handling
    code: "void SomeBattlefield::OnPlayerKill(Player* killer, Unit* killed)\n{\n \
      \   HandleKill(killer, killed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Battlefield Logic
    code: "void CustomBattlefield::HandleKill(Player* killer, Unit* killed)\n{\n \
      \   // Perform standard battlefield kill handling\n    Battlefield::HandleKill(killer,\
      \ killed);\n    \n    // Additional custom logic\n    if (killer->GetTeam()\
      \ == ALLIANCE)\n        ++m_allianceKills;\n    else\n        ++m_hordeKills;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    upon detecting a kill event. Developers should ensure that any custom implementations
    do not interfere with core battlefield functionality or cause race conditions
    in multi-threaded environments. The method may modify internal state variables
    and trigger callbacks to other systems.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect scoring, broken
    win conditions, or inconsistent game state. Avoid calling this method directly
    unless you are certain about the implications. Ensure that both player and unit
    parameters are valid pointers before invoking this method.
