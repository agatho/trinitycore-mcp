documentation:
  brief: Executes a movement operation to the specified target position with the given
    priority level
  description: The ExecuteMovement method initiates a movement action for an entity
    (such as a player or NPC) towards a predefined target position. It takes into
    account the movement priority to determine how quickly and under what conditions
    the movement should be processed. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with PositionManager's internal pathfinding and movement queue systems to ensure
    smooth and efficient character navigation within the game world. The method returns
    a MovementResult indicating whether the movement was successfully queued, rejected
    due to priority constraints, or failed for other reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPos
    description: The target position identifier or index that the entity should move
      towards. This is typically an integer representing a predefined location in
      the game world's positioning system.
  - name: priority
    description: The movement priority level that determines how quickly the movement
      should be processed relative to other pending movements. Higher priority movements
      are executed before lower priority ones when resources are limited.
  returns: A MovementResult enum value indicating the outcome of the movement execution
    attempt. Possible values include SUCCESS if the movement was queued, PRIORITY_DENIED
    if it was rejected due to insufficient priority, or FAILURE for other execution
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Execution
    code: "PositionManager* posMgr = player->GetPositionManager();\nMovementResult\
      \ result = posMgr->ExecuteMovement(5, MovementPriority::HIGH);\nif (result ==\
      \ MovementResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Movement queued successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Priority Levels
    code: 'PositionManager* posMgr = player->GetPositionManager();

      MovementResult result1 = posMgr->ExecuteMovement(10, MovementPriority::LOW);

      MovementResult result2 = posMgr->ExecuteMovement(15, MovementPriority::HIGH);

      // HIGH priority movement will be processed before LOW priority one'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately perform the movement; it queues the action
    for later execution by the movement system. The actual pathfinding and movement
    logic occurs asynchronously in the game loop. Developers should ensure that targetPos
    values are valid identifiers within the PositionManager's internal coordinate
    system.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid targetPos values may result in undefined
    behavior or failed movement attempts. Priority levels must be properly defined
    within the MovementPriority enum to avoid unexpected execution ordering.
