  class: LFGBotManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: void LFGBotManager::GetStatistics(uint32 & totalQueued, uint32 & totalAssignments)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of queued players and active assignments managed
    by the LFG bot system.
  description: 'The GetStatistics method retrieves statistical information about the
    current state of the Looking For Group (LFG) bot system. It provides two key metrics:
    the total number of players currently queued in the LFG system and the total number
    of active group assignments that have been made. This method is typically used
    for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand the load and activity level
    of the LFG bot functionality within the TrinityCore server. The method does not
    modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.'
  parameters:
  - name: totalQueued
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be populated with the total
      count of players currently queued in the LFG system.
  - name: totalAssignments
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be populated with the total
      count of active group assignments made by the LFG bot system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 queued = 0;

      uint32 assignments = 0;

      LFGBotManager::GetStatistics(queued, assignments);

      TC_LOG_INFO("lfg", "LFG Stats - Queued: %u, Assignments: %u", queued, assignments);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Integration Example
    code: "void LogLFGBotStats()\n{\n    uint32 totalQueued = 0;\n    uint32 totalAssignments\
      \ = 0;\n    sLFGBotManager->GetStatistics(totalQueued, totalAssignments);\n\
      \    \n    if (totalQueued > 100)\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"lfg\", \"High LFG queue\
      \ detected: %u players queued\", totalQueued);\n    \n    if (totalAssignments\
      \ > 500)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"lfg\", \"High assignment count: %u active groups\
      \ formed\", totalAssignments);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of current statistics and should be called
    with appropriate locking if accessed from multiple threads. The values returned
    are not guaranteed to be consistent across multiple calls due to concurrent operations
    in the LFG system.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters, so
    callers must ensure that the referenced variables are valid before calling this
    method. Improper handling of references may lead to undefined behavior.
