documentation:
  brief: Sends a role chosen message to the player's group members in LFG.
  description: The SendLfgRoleChosen method is used to notify all members of a player's
    Looking For Group (LFG) dungeon group about the roles that a specific player has
    selected for a dungeon. This method is part of the LFG system in TrinityCore and
    ensures that group members are aware of each other's role assignments, which is
    crucial for proper dungeon formation and gameplay. The method takes the GUID of
    the player who chose the roles, the GUID of the player's group, and the roles
    themselves as parameters. It likely sends a packet to all group members to update
    their LFG status UI.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who has chosen
      the roles.
  - name: pguid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player's group or instance.
  - name: roles
    description: A bitmask representing the roles chosen by the player. Each bit corresponds
      to a specific role such as tank, healer, or damage dealer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendLfgRoleChosen
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SendLfgRoleChosen(playerGuid, groupGuid, ROLE_TANK |
      ROLE_HEALER);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when a player
    selects their roles. Developers should ensure that the role bitmask passed in
    is valid and corresponds to supported roles within the game's LFG framework.
