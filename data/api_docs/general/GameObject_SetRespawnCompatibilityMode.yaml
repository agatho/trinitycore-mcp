  class: GameObject
  method: SetRespawnCompatibilityMode
  signature: void GameObject::SetRespawnCompatibilityMode(bool mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the respawn compatibility mode for a game object, determining whether
    it should respawn according to legacy or modern mechanics.
  description: This method controls whether a GameObject will use legacy respawn behavior
    or modern respawn mechanics. When set to true, the object will follow legacy respawn
    rules which may affect how it respawns after being destroyed or despawned. When
    set to false, it will use modern respawn behavior that aligns with current game
    mechanics. This setting is particularly important for maintaining compatibility
    with older content or custom scripts that rely on specific respawn behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable legacy respawn mode
      (true) or modern respawn mode (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Legacy Respawn Mode
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetRespawnCompatibilityMode(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Modern Respawn Mode
    code: 'GameObject* go = GetGameObject();

      go->SetRespawnCompatibilityMode(false);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the object's respawn behavior and should be used carefully
    during initialization or when changing game mechanics. The setting may influence
    how the object interacts with world state changes and server-side events.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected respawn behavior, especially
    in scenarios where legacy and modern mechanics conflict. It should not be used
    lightly during active gameplay or in situations where object state needs to remain
    consistent.
