  method: GetJumpParams
  signature: const JumpMovementParams & MovementRequest::GetJumpParams() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the jump movement parameters associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetJumpParams method returns a constant reference to the JumpMovementParams
    structure that contains all relevant data for executing a jump movement. This
    includes properties such as jump height, velocity, and duration. The returned
    parameters are used by the movement handler to calculate and apply the appropriate
    physics-based jump animation and trajectory. This method is typically invoked
    during movement processing when a character is scheduled to perform a jump action,
    ensuring that all jump-related configuration is properly retrieved and applied.
    The parameters are immutable once set and should not be modified directly through
    this accessor.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the JumpMovementParams structure containing the
    jump-specific movement data including height, velocity, and timing information
    required for executing a jump animation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving jump parameters for movement processing
    code: "void ProcessPlayerJump(MovementRequest& request)\n{\n    const JumpMovementParams&\
      \ params = request.GetJumpParams();\n    // Use params to determine jump height\
      \ and velocity\n    float jumpHeight = params.height;\n    float jumpVelocity\
      \ = params.velocity;\n    // Apply jump logic using retrieved parameters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest object
    remains in scope. This method does not perform any validation or default initialization
    of the jump parameters - it simply returns what has been previously set. The underlying
    JumpMovementParams structure should be properly initialized before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on a MovementRequest that was not initialized with
    jump data may result in accessing invalid memory or unexpected behavior. Ensure
    that jump movement is explicitly requested before attempting to retrieve these
    parameters.
