  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTemplateResistances()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature template resistances from the database into memory for use
    in combat calculations.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplateResistances method initializes and populates
    the internal data structures that store resistance values for different creature
    templates. This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations to ensure that all creature types have their proper resistance attributes
    loaded from the database tables. These resistances affect how creatures respond
    to various damage types and spell effects in combat, making this data crucial
    for accurate game mechanics. The method iterates through the creature template
    entries in the database and caches their resistance values for efficient lookup
    during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n  \
      \  sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureTemplateResistances();\n    // ... continue with\
      \ other loading operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization process. It's important to note that this method
    does not validate the loaded data against current game balance requirements -
    it simply loads what exists in the database. The loaded resistances are cached
    and used throughout the server's runtime without requiring additional database
    queries.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the database is properly connected
    and accessible. Calling it before database initialization may result in empty
    or invalid data loading. Additionally, calling this method during active gameplay
    (while players are online) could cause temporary performance degradation as it
    reprocesses all creature template resistance data.
