  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetDpsThreatThreshold
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetDpsThreatThreshold(float percent)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the DPS threat threshold percentage for the ThreatCoordinator.
  description: The SetDpsThreatThreshold method configures the percentage value that
    determines when a DPS (Damage Per Second) unit in a combat situation should be
    considered as having sufficient threat to maintain aggro. This setting is crucial
    for controlling how aggressively the system handles threat generation and mob
    targeting behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. The method
    accepts a float parameter representing the threshold as a percentage, where values
    typically range from 0.0 to 100.0. This value influences how quickly or slowly
    mobs shift their target based on threat levels.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The threat threshold percentage for DPS units. Valid values are typically
      between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 means no threat is required to maintain aggro
      and 100.0 means full threat must be maintained.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a moderate DPS threat threshold
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetDpsThreatThreshold(75.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a low DPS threat threshold for more aggressive targeting
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetDpsThreatThreshold(25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the combat behavior of mobs and should be used
    carefully in custom AI scripts or modifications. The value set here influences
    how often threat updates are processed and whether a mob will switch targets based
    on DPS contributions.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause mobs to rapidly shift targets, leading
    to unstable combat dynamics. Conversely, setting it too high might prevent proper
    threat management in high-dps scenarios.
