  brief: Updates the internal configuration cache for bot sessions.
  description: The UpdateConfigurationCache method refreshes the cached configuration
    data used by the BotSessionFactory. This ensures that any changes to bot-related
    settings or parameters are reflected in active bot sessions. The method typically
    reads from persistent storage or configuration files and updates in-memory caches
    to maintain consistency across all bot operations. It is commonly invoked during
    server startup, configuration reloads, or when runtime modifications occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotSessionFactory::instance()->UpdateConfigurationCache();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any configuration changes to ensure that
    bot behavior reflects the latest settings. It may involve file I/O operations
    and could block briefly during cache refresh.
