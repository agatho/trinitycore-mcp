documentation:
  brief: Sets the cannot turn flag for a unit, preventing it from turning during movement.
  description: This method controls whether a unit can turn during movement operations.
    When applied, it prevents the unit from turning while moving, which is useful
    for controlling movement behavior in various game scenarios such as combat or
    specific mechanics. The flag affects movement direction and can be used to enforce
    certain movement restrictions during pathfinding or movement updates.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->SetCannotTurn(true);

      // Unit now cannot turn during movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement control mechanics
    and may affect pathfinding behavior. It should be used carefully as it can interfere
    with normal movement operations.
  warnings: Using this method incorrectly can cause units to become stuck or unable
    to move properly, especially when combined with other movement restrictions.
