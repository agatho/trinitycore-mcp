  signature: void EssenceInfo::SpendEssence(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the essence amount by the specified value
  description: The SpendEssence method decreases the current essence count stored
    within the EssenceInfo object by the provided amount. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage player resources such
    as arcane essence, shadow essence, or other game-specific currency systems. The
    method performs no validation on the input value, so it is expected that callers
    ensure the amount does not exceed the current essence balance. If the amount exceeds
    available essence, behavior may result in negative values or undefined state depending
    on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The positive integer value representing the amount of essence to
      be spent. Must be a non-negative number; behavior is undefined if negative values
      are passed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Spending
    code: 'EssenceInfo essence;

      essence.SpendEssence(10);

      // Reduces essence by 10 units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Spending Essence with Precondition Check
    code: "EssenceInfo essence;\nif (essence.GetCurrentEssence() >= 25) {\n    essence.SpendEssence(25);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle insufficient essence\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the EssenceInfo object directly.
    It is recommended to use this in conjunction with appropriate checks to ensure
    that spending does not result in invalid states (e.g., negative essence values).
    The implementation should be thread-safe if used across multiple threads.
  warnings: Passing a negative value for 'amount' may lead to unexpected behavior
    or overflow issues. Always validate input before calling this method to prevent
    unintended consequences.
