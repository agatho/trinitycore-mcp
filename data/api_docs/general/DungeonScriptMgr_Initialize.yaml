documentation:
  brief: Initializes the dungeon script manager system
  description: The DungeonScriptMgr::Initialize method sets up and prepares the dungeon
    script management subsystem within TrinityCore. This method is responsible for
    loading, registering, and configuring all dungeon-related scripts and their associated
    game mechanics. It typically runs during server startup or when dungeon instances
    are first created, ensuring that all scripted behaviors, quest triggers, and encounter
    logic are properly initialized and ready for execution. The initialization process
    may involve loading script configurations, setting up event handlers, and validating
    script dependencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: DungeonScriptMgr::instance()->Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It is
    typically invoked automatically by the core system and should not be manually
    called in most scenarios unless specifically required for dynamic dungeon script
    reloading.
