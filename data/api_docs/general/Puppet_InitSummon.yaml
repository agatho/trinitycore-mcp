  method: InitSummon
  signature: void Puppet::InitSummon(int * summoner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a puppet summon with the provided summoner reference
  description: The InitSummon method sets up a puppet entity by associating it with
    a summoner. This method is typically called during the creation or activation
    of summoned creatures, particularly those that act as puppets for player characters
    or controlled entities. It establishes the relationship between the puppet and
    its summoner, which is crucial for proper behavior, targeting, and interaction
    within the game world. The method likely configures internal state variables and
    may trigger additional initialization routines required for puppet functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the summoner's identifier or index.
      This parameter defines which entity is responsible for controlling or creating
      this puppet instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Puppet Initialization
    code: 'Puppet* myPuppet = new Puppet();

      int summonerId = 12345;

      myPuppet->InitSummon(&summonerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after creating a puppet instance
    to ensure proper initialization. The summoner parameter is expected to be a valid
    identifier that corresponds to an existing entity in the game world.
  warnings: Incorrect or null values for the summoner parameter may lead to undefined
    behavior or failed initialization. Ensure that the summoner reference points to
    a valid entity before calling this method.
