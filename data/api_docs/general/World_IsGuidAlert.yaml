documentation:
  brief: Checks if a GUID alert is currently active in the world
  description: The IsGuidAlert method determines whether a global GUID alert condition
    is currently enabled within the World instance. This functionality is typically
    used to track special events or conditions that require immediate attention, such
    as high-value target alerts or system-wide notifications. The method returns a
    boolean value indicating the current state of this alert flag.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a GUID alert is currently active; otherwise returns false.
    This indicates whether the world is in a state where GUID-based alerts are enabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sWorld->IsGuidAlert()) {\n    // Handle active GUID alert\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      GUID Alert is active\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Alert Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerInteraction(Player* player) {\n    if (sWorld->IsGuidAlert())\
      \ {\n        // Process special alert behavior\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Special alert active\");\n    } else {\n        // Normal interaction\n    \
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Standard interaction\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a global flag that can be set or cleared by
    various system events. The implementation may involve thread synchronization to
    ensure consistent state across multiple threads processing world events.
