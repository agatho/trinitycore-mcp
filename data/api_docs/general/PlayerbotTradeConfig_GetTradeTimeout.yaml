documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the trade timeout value for player bot trading behavior
  description: The GetTradeTimeout method returns the configured timeout duration
    in seconds for player bot trade operations within the TrinityCore framework. This
    value determines how long a player bot will wait before automatically canceling
    an ongoing trade attempt if no response is received from the trading partner.
    The timeout mechanism helps prevent bots from hanging indefinitely during trade
    negotiations and ensures efficient resource utilization. This configuration is
    typically loaded from the playerbot configuration files and can be adjusted based
    on server settings or gameplay balance requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the trade timeout in seconds. A value
    of 0 typically indicates that no timeout is enforced, while positive values define
    the maximum wait time before automatically cancelling the trade.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 timeout = playerbotTradeConfig->GetTradeTimeout();\nif (timeout\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use timeout value for trade logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Trade timeout set to {} seconds\", timeout);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot AI configuration system and should be
    called after the configuration has been properly initialized. The returned value
    may vary between different server configurations or playerbot build variants.
