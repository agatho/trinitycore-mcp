documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature first appears in the world
  description: The JustAppeared method is called when a creature AI object is initialized
    and the creature has just become visible in the game world. This method serves
    as a hook for custom AI behavior that should execute immediately upon the creature's
    appearance, such as setting initial states, starting timers, or triggering events.
    It is part of the creature AI lifecycle and typically invoked during the creature's
    creation or respawn process. The method does not accept any parameters and performs
    no default actions in the base NullCreatureAI implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyCustomCreatureAI : public NullCreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustAppeared()\
      \ override {\n        // Custom logic when creature appears\n        me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called once per creature instance when it becomes active in
    the world. It should not be used for repeated periodic actions; consider using
    UpdateAI or scheduled events for those purposes.
