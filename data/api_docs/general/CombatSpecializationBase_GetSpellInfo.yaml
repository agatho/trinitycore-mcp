documentation:
  brief: Retrieves spell information for a given spell ID from the combat specialization
    base.
  description: The GetSpellInfo method retrieves detailed information about a specific
    spell identified by its unique spell ID. This method is typically used within
    the context of combat specializations to access spell data such as damage values,
    cast times, cooldowns, and other spell properties. The returned SpellInfo pointer
    provides access to all relevant spell attributes that are defined in the game's
    spell database. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for
    read-only operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
    about the specified spell. Returns nullptr if the spell ID is invalid or not found
    in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell info for a basic attack
    code: "const SpellInfo* spellInfo = combatSpecBase->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    // Use spellInfo to access spell properties\n    uint32 damage = spellInfo->Effects[0].DamageMin;\n\
      \    uint32 castTime = spellInfo->CastTime;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the global spell database, so repeated calls
    with the same spell ID may have performance implications. The returned SpellInfo
    pointer is valid only as long as the spell database remains loaded and should
    not be cached across server restarts or reloads.
  warnings: The returned SpellInfo pointer must never be modified directly as it points
    to read-only data within the global spell database. Attempting to modify its contents
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
