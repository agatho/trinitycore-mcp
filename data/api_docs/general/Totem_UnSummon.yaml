  method: UnSummon
  signature: void Totem::UnSummon(int msTime)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the totem from the world, optionally with a delay.
  description: The UnSummon method removes a totem from the game world. It can be
    called immediately or with a specified time delay in milliseconds before removal.
    This method is typically invoked when a totem's duration expires or when the player
    explicitly dismisses it. The totem will be destroyed and removed from the player's
    pet list, and any associated effects or summons will be cleared. If msTime is
    set to 0, the totem is removed immediately; otherwise, it will be scheduled for
    removal after the specified delay.
  parameters:
  - name: msTime
    description: The time in milliseconds before the totem is removed from the world.
      If set to 0, the totem is removed immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Immediate Unsummon
    code: totem->UnSummon(0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed Unsummon
    code: totem->UnSummon(5000); // Removes totem after 5 seconds
    language: cpp
  notes: This method handles the cleanup of the totem's presence in the game world,
    including removing it from the player's pet list and clearing any associated summoned
    creatures or effects. The actual removal may be deferred if a delay is specified.
  warnings: Calling this method on a totem that has already been unsummoned can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper state checks before calling this method.
