  signature: void ScopedPatternRecording::~ScopedPatternRecording()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the scoped pattern recording instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ScopedPatternRecording class is responsible
    for releasing any allocated memory or resources that were used during pattern
    recording. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures when
    the object goes out of scope. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and scripting
    systems, this may involve cleaning up temporary recording buffers or resetting
    state variables to prevent memory leaks. The destructor is automatically invoked
    by the C++ runtime when a ScopedPatternRecording object is destroyed, typically
    at the end of its scope.

  - title: Basic Usage in Function Scope
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    ScopedPatternRecording recording;\n    // ...\
      \ perform pattern recording operations ...\n    // recording is automatically\
      \ destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called manually unless explicitly needed. The
    automatic cleanup ensures that resources are properly released when the object's
    scope ends. It is important to understand that this class likely manages temporary
    data structures that must be cleaned up to prevent memory leaks in long-running
    systems like World of Warcraft servers.
