  class: MovementForces
  method: FindMovementForce
  signature: int MovementForces::FindMovementForce(ObjectGuid id)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the movement force value associated with the specified
    object GUID.
  description: The FindMovementForce method retrieves the movement force value assigned
    to an object identified by its ObjectGuid. This method is typically used in the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to manage and
    query movement-related physics or mechanics for game entities such as players,
    creatures, or game objects. The returned integer represents a force magnitude
    that may influence how an object moves within the game world. This method assumes
    that the movement force has already been initialized or set for the given object.
    If no movement force is found for the specified GUID, the method may return a
    default or error value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement force value associated with the provided
    ObjectGuid. Returns 0 if no movement force is found or if the object does not
    exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindMovementForce
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);\nint force\
      \ = movementForces->FindMovementForce(guid);\nif (force > 0)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ the movement force value\n    std::cout << \"Movement force: \" << force <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing physics or movement
    behaviors for game objects. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like
    SetMovementForce or RemoveMovementForce to maintain consistent state across the
    movement system.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObjectGuid passed to this method corresponds to an existing
    object in the world; otherwise, the result may be undefined or misleading. This
    method does not validate the existence of the object internally.
