  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ShouldWaitForGroup
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::ShouldWaitForGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group coordinator should wait for additional players
    to join the group before proceeding.
  description: The ShouldWaitForGroup method evaluates the current state of the group
    coordinator to decide if it should delay execution or proceed immediately. This
    is typically used in scenarios where a group operation requires a minimum number
    of members before it can commence, such as dungeon entries, raids, or other coordinated
    activities. The method checks internal group membership criteria and returns true
    if additional players are needed, or false if the group is ready to proceed. This
    functionality supports dynamic group management and ensures that operations do
    not begin prematurely when required participants are missing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordinator should wait for more players to join
    before continuing; returns false if the group has sufficient members or if waiting
    is no longer required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group initialization
    code: "if (groupCoordinator.ShouldWaitForGroup()) {\n    // Wait for more players\n\
      \    SendWaitingMessage();\n} else {\n    // Proceed with group operation\n\
      \    StartDungeonEntry();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group update logic
    code: "void UpdateGroupStatus() {\n    if (groupCoordinator.ShouldWaitForGroup())\
      \ {\n        // Notify players and maintain waiting state\n        BroadcastGroupStatus(\"\
      Waiting for more members...\");\n    } else {\n        // Start the coordinated\
      \ activity\n        BeginGroupActivity();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group state transitions and may be
    influenced by configuration settings such as minimum group size requirements.
    It's important to note that the decision to wait might also depend on external
    factors like player availability, instance locks, or server load balancing policies.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of false means the group is fully formed;
    other systems may still be validating membership. Also, excessive reliance on
    this method without proper timeout handling could lead to indefinite waiting states
    in certain edge cases.
