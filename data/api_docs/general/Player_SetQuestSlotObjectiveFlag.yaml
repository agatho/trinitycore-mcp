  class: Player
  method: SetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag
  signature: void Player::SetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(uint16 slot, int8 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the objective flag for a specified quest slot in the player's quest
    log.
  description: This method allows developers to modify the objective flag status for
    a specific quest slot within the player's quest log. It is used primarily to update
    the state of quest objectives, particularly when dealing with quest completion
    or progress tracking. The method operates on the player's quest log data structure
    and affects how quest objectives are displayed in the UI. This functionality is
    crucial for implementing custom quest systems or modifying existing quest behaviors
    within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) where the objective flag needs to be
      set. This represents the position of the quest in the player's quest log.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that should
      be modified. This typically corresponds to an objective within a multi-objective
      quest, with values ranging from -1 to 255 (where -1 indicates no objective).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(0, 0); // Set first objective flag for quest
      in slot 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint16 questSlot = 5;

      int8 objectiveIndex = 2;

      player->SetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(questSlot, objectiveIndex);

      // This sets the third objective flag for a quest in slot 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's quest system. The
    implementation involves modifying internal quest data structures and may affect
    UI display. Performance considerations include potential overhead when multiple
    calls are made simultaneously.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause quest objectives to display incorrectly
    in the UI, potentially leading to confusion for players. Care should be taken
    when setting objective flags for quests that have already been completed or are
    in progress.
