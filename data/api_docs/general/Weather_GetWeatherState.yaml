  class: Weather
  method: GetWeatherState
  signature: WeatherState Weather::GetWeatherState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current weather state for the associated zone.
  description: The GetWeatherState method returns the active weather condition for
    the zone that this Weather object represents. This method is used internally by
    the game engine to determine visual and audio effects related to weather, such
    as rain, snow, or storms. The returned WeatherState enum indicates the intensity
    and type of weather currently affecting the area. This information is crucial
    for client-side rendering and player experience, as it affects visibility, movement
    speed, and environmental interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A WeatherState enumeration value representing the current weather condition
    in the zone. Possible values include WEATHER_STATE_FINE, WEATHER_STATE_RAIN, WEATHER_STATE_SNOW,
    and WEATHER_STATE_STORM, each with associated intensity levels that determine
    the visual and gameplay effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Current Weather
    code: "Weather* weather = sWorld->GetWeather(player->GetZoneId());\nif (weather)\n\
      {\n    WeatherState state = weather->GetWeatherState();\n    if (state == WEATHER_STATE_RAIN)\n\
      \        SendNotification(\"It's raining heavily.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    WeatherState value should not be modified directly as it reflects the current
    state of the zone's weather system.
