documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger bounded plane, resetting its
    modification state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the AreaTriggerBoundedPlane instance. This operation is typically used to
    indicate that all previously marked changes have been processed or acknowledged,
    effectively clearing the dirty flag that tracks modifications to the area trigger's
    properties. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    method ensures that subsequent updates to the area trigger's state are properly
    tracked and synchronized with clients. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations, making it a simple state-resetting utility.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AreaTriggerBoundedPlane* plane = new AreaTriggerBoundedPlane();

      // ... modify the plane ...

      plane->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with change tracking systems
    to manage synchronization of area trigger states between server and client. It
    should be called after applying or acknowledging changes to prevent redundant
    updates.
