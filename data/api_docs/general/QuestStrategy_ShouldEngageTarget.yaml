  class: QuestStrategy
  method: ShouldEngageTarget
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::ShouldEngageTarget(BotAI * ai, ::Unit * target, const
    int & objective) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should engage a target unit based on quest objectives
    and AI state.
  description: The ShouldEngageTarget method evaluates if a bot's AI should initiate
    combat or interaction with a specified target unit. It considers the current quest
    objective, the target's status (e.g., alive, hostile), and the bot's tactical
    state to make this decision. This method is typically used within the context
    of quest completion strategies where specific targets must be engaged to progress.
    The evaluation includes checking if the target is a valid quest objective, whether
    it's within engagement range, and if the AI's current mode allows for target engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot. Used to access
      AI state, quest data, and tactical settings.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit that may be engaged. Represents the potential
      target for combat or interaction based on current quest objectives.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current quest objective
      index. Used to determine if the target matches the required quest target type.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should engage the target based on quest requirements
    and AI state; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the
    target is a valid quest objective and suitable for engagement under current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest strategy
    code: "bool shouldEngage = strategy.ShouldEngageTarget(ai, targetUnit, questObjectiveIndex);\n\
      if (shouldEngage)\n{\n    ai->Attack(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest completion logic
    code: "void QuestStrategy::Update()\n{\n    if (ShouldEngageTarget(ai, target,\
      \ currentObjective))\n    {\n        ai->SetState(BotAI::ENGAGING);\n      \
      \  ai->MoveTo(target->GetPosition());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core quest strategy system and relies heavily
    on accurate quest data and AI state tracking. The objective parameter should be
    validated before calling to ensure it corresponds to a valid quest target. Performance-wise,
    this method should execute quickly as it's called frequently during bot decision-making
    loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is not null before passing it to this
    method. Passing an invalid or destroyed unit pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, verify that the objective index is within valid range for the current quest
    to avoid incorrect engagement decisions.
