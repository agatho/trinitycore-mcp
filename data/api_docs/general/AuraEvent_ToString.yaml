documentation:
  brief: Converts an AuraEvent object into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of the AuraEvent
    instance, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying aura-related information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly employed in TrinityCore's core systems
    to serialize aura event data for diagnostic purposes or integration with logging
    frameworks. The output string usually contains key identifying information about
    the aura event such as its type, target, caster, and duration if applicable. It
    does not modify the internal state of the AuraEvent object and is safe to call
    multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the AuraEvent object,
    typically including identifying attributes like event type, affected unit, caster,
    and other relevant aura properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'AuraEvent* event = new AuraEvent();

      std::string eventStr = event->ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("aura", "Aura Event Details: %s", eventStr.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Unit Aura Management
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetTarget();\nif (target && target->HasAura(12345))\
      \ {\n    Aura* aura = target->GetAura(12345);\n    AuraEvent event = aura->GetAuraEvent();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_INFO(\"aura\", \"Processing aura event: %s\", event.ToString().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and logging purposes. The
    exact format of the returned string may vary between different TrinityCore versions
    or builds, so relying on specific formatting should be avoided in production code.
    The method performs no complex operations and has minimal performance impact.
  warnings: Do not use the return value for programmatic logic decisions as the format
    is not guaranteed to remain stable across updates. If you require structured data
    access, prefer using dedicated getter methods instead of parsing the string output.
