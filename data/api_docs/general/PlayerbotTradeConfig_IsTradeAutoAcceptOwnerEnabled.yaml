documentation:
  brief: Checks whether auto-accept trade is enabled for the player's owner in playerbot
    functionality.
  description: This method determines if the playerbot system should automatically
    accept trade requests initiated by the player's owner. It is part of the trade
    configuration settings within the Playerbot framework, which allows bot behavior
    to be customized based on player preferences and game mechanics. The setting affects
    how bots interact with their owners during trading scenarios, particularly in
    automated or assisted gameplay contexts. This method does not modify any state
    but rather retrieves a boolean flag from internal configuration storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if auto-accept trade for owner is enabled; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the playerbot will automatically accept trade offers
    made by the player who owns the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Check if owner trade auto-accept is enabled
    code: "if (playerBot->GetTradeConfig()->IsTradeAutoAcceptOwnerEnabled()) {\n \
      \   // Bot will automatically accept trades from owner\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auto-accept trade for owner is enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Bot will not auto-accept\
      \ trades from owner\n    sLog->outString(\"Auto-accept trade for owner is disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in playerbot AI logic to determine appropriate
    trade behavior. It relies on configuration values that may be set via in-game
    commands or configuration files. The result of this check influences the bot's
    decision-making process during trade interactions with its owner.
