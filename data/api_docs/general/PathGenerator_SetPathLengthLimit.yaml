  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetPathLengthLimit
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetPathLengthLimit(float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed path length for navigation calculations.
  description: The SetPathLengthLimit method configures the maximum distance that
    a pathfinding algorithm will consider when generating movement paths for units
    in World of Warcraft. This limit helps prevent excessive computational overhead
    and ensures that pathfinding operations complete within reasonable timeframes.
    The value is typically specified in yards and affects how far AI-controlled creatures
    or NPCs will search for valid movement routes. Setting this value too low may
    result in incomplete paths, while setting it too high can lead to performance
    degradation during complex navigation scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: distance
    description: The maximum path length allowed in yards. Must be a positive floating-point
      number representing the distance limit for pathfinding calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Path Length Limit for NPC Movement
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetPathLengthLimit(50.0f);

      // This restricts NPC movement paths to a maximum of 50 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Path Limit for Large-Scale Instances
    code: "PathGenerator* generator = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (generator && generator->GetMovementType() == MOTION_TYPE_PATH)\n{\n    generator->SetPathLengthLimit(100.0f);\n\
      }\n// Increases path limit for complex instance navigation"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the PathGenerator's internal pathfinding
    behavior and should be called before initiating any path calculations. The default
    value is typically set based on game mechanics requirements, but can be adjusted
    per unit or scenario as needed.
  warnings: Setting extremely high values may cause performance issues during pathfinding
    operations, especially in densely populated areas or complex terrain. Ensure that
    the limit is appropriate for the specific use case to avoid unnecessary computational
    load.
