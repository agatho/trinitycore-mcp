    & context, int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Scans game objects in the detection context to count obstacles for avoidance
    behavior.
  description: The ScanGameObjects method analyzes the provided DetectionContext to
    identify and count game objects that act as obstacles within the AI's navigation
    space. This method is typically used during pathfinding or movement logic to determine
    how many barriers exist in a given direction or area. It updates the obstacles
    parameter with the total number of detected obstacles, which can then be used
    by avoidance algorithms to modify movement behavior. The method operates on the
    current state of the game world and relies on accurate spatial detection mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The DetectionContext object containing information about the area
      or direction to scan for obstacles, including position, radius, and other relevant
      parameters for detection.
  - name: obstacles
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the total count
      of detected obstacles found within the specified detection context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle counting example
    code: "DetectionContext context;\ncontext.position = player->GetPosition();\n\
      context.radius = 10.0f;\nint obstacleCount = 0;\nmanager.ScanGameObjects(context,\
      \ obstacleCount);\nif (obstacleCount > 0) {\n    // Adjust movement to avoid\
      \ obstacles\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI movement logic
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    DetectionContext context;\n \
      \   context.position = me->GetPosition();\n    context.radius = 15.0f;\n   \
      \ int obstacleCount = 0;\n    obstacleManager.ScanGameObjects(context, obstacleCount);\n\
      \    if (obstacleCount > 2) {\n        // Implement avoidance behavior\n   \
      \     me->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveRandom(5.0f);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the obstacle avoidance system and should be called
    regularly during AI update cycles to maintain accurate obstacle detection. Performance
    may degrade if large numbers of game objects are present in the detection radius.
    The method assumes that the DetectionContext has been properly initialized with
    valid position and radius values.
  warnings: Ensure that the DetectionContext parameters (position, radius) are valid
    before calling this method; invalid data can lead to incorrect obstacle counts
    or undefined behavior. This method modifies the obstacles parameter directly,
    so ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
