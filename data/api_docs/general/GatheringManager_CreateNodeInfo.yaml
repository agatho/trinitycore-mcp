  class: GatheringManager
  method: CreateNodeInfo
  signature: GatheringNode GatheringManager::CreateNodeInfo(Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a GatheringNode object containing information about the
    specified creature.
  description: The CreateNodeInfo method is responsible for constructing a GatheringNode
    data structure based on the properties and state of a given Creature object. This
    method is typically used in the context of gathering mechanics within World of
    Warcraft, such as mining nodes, herbalism plants, or other resource sources. It
    extracts relevant information from the creature, including its position, type,
    respawn time, and any associated loot or requirements. The returned GatheringNode
    can then be used by other systems to manage resource collection, display UI elements,
    or track player interactions with gathering resources.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to the Creature object from which to extract gathering
      node information. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      creature that serves as a gathering resource.
  returns: A GatheringNode object containing all relevant data about the specified
    creature's gathering properties, including position, type, respawn time, and other
    metadata necessary for game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* nodeCreature = ...; // some valid Creature pointer

      GatheringNode nodeInfo = gatheringManager.CreateNodeInfo(nodeCreature);

      // Use nodeInfo for further processing or UI display'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Interaction
    code: "void HandlePlayerGather(Player* player, Creature* target)\n{\n    if (target\
      \ && target->IsGatheringNode())\n    {\n        GatheringNode node = gatheringManager.CreateNodeInfo(target);\n\
      \        // Process the node data for loot distribution or cooldown handling\n\
      \        player->AddGatheringNode(node);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Creature object has been properly initialized
    and contains valid gathering-related data. The implementation may cache or reference
    internal creature properties to build the GatheringNode, so it's important that
    the creature is in a valid state when this method is called.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the creature parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Creature object is valid and represents
    an actual gathering node before calling this method.
