  signature: void VendorInteraction::LoadVendorInventoryFromNpcVendor()
documentation:
  brief: Loads the vendor's inventory items from the NPC vendor data table into memory
    for interaction.
  description: The LoadVendorInventoryFromNpcVendor method initializes and populates
    the vendor's item inventory by retrieving data from the 'npc_vendor' database
    table. This method is typically invoked during the initialization or activation
    of a vendor NPC to ensure that all items available for sale are loaded into the
    vendor's internal inventory structure. It processes each entry in the npc_vendor
    table associated with the current vendor's entry ID, creating item templates and
    storing them in an accessible collection for subsequent purchase or interaction
    logic. The method ensures that vendors display accurate and up-to-date inventories
    based on database configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Initialization
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.LoadVendorInventoryFromNpcVendor();

      // Vendor inventory is now loaded and ready for player interaction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the current NPC's entry ID has been set. It may be called multiple times,
    but typically only once during vendor setup. Performance can be affected if a
    vendor has a large number of items in the npc_vendor table.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper NPC context or database initialization
    may result in undefined behavior or empty inventories. Ensure that the vendor's
    entry ID is correctly set before invoking this method.
