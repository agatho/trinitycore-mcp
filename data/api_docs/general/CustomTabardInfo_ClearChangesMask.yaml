documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the custom tabard information.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask within
    the CustomTabardInfo class. This mask is typically used to track which aspects
    of a player's custom tabard (such as emblem, border, or background) have been
    modified since the last update. By clearing this mask, the system effectively
    marks all tabard elements as unchanged, ensuring that subsequent operations or
    synchronization processes do not consider these elements as having been altered.
    This method is commonly invoked after applying changes to prevent redundant updates
    or to reset the state for a new set of modifications.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CustomTabardInfo tabardInfo;

      tabardInfo.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any visible tabard data; it only resets an internal
    tracking mechanism. It should be called after processing or applying changes to
    avoid unnecessary re-syncs.
