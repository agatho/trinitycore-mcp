  signature: bool ItemMod::operator!=(const ItemMod & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ItemMod objects for inequality and returns true if they are
    not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ItemMod instance
    and another ItemMod object to determine whether they are not equivalent. It is
    typically used in conditional statements or containers where it's necessary to
    check if two item modification structures differ. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, ItemMod represents modifications applied to items
    such as stat bonuses, enchantments, or other properties. This comparison operator
    likely evaluates fields like modifier type, value, and potential associated identifiers
    to decide equality. The method is const, meaning it does not alter the state of
    either object during comparison.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ItemMod object to compare against this instance for inequality.
  returns: Returns true if the current ItemMod object and the provided 'right' ItemMod
    object are not equal; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'ItemMod mod1;

      ItemMod mod2;

      bool result = (mod1 != mod2); // Returns true if mods differ

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (itemMod != anotherItemMod) {\n    // Handle case where item modifications\
      \ are different\n    ApplyNewModifications();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in STL containers like std::set or std::map
    when sorting or finding elements. It relies on the underlying implementation of
    equality comparison, which usually compares all relevant fields of the ItemMod
    structure to determine if they are identical.
