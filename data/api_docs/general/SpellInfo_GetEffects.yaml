documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of effects associated with a spell.
  description: The GetEffects method retrieves the count of effects that are defined
    for a specific spell within the TrinityCore database. This method is commonly
    used in spell handling logic to determine how many effect entries are present
    in a spell's data structure, which can influence gameplay mechanics such as damage
    calculation, healing, or other spell effects. It provides a way to access the
    total number of effects without needing to iterate through them manually. The
    method is typically called during spell processing or when evaluating spell properties
    for various game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the number of effects defined for the spell, which corresponds
    to the total count of effect entries in the spell's data structure. This value
    can be zero or more depending on how many effects are specified in the spell definition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int effectCount = spellInfo->GetEffects();\nif (effectCount > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Process each effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and should be used carefully in
    contexts where spell data needs to be accessed. Performance considerations are
    minimal since this is a simple getter function, but it may be called frequently
    during spell processing.
