  class: ClassAI
  method: GetSpellRange
  signature: float ClassAI::GetSpellRange(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum range of a specified spell for the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The GetSpellRange method returns the maximum casting range of a given
    spell as defined in the spell database. This value is used by the ClassAI system
    to determine whether an enemy target is within acceptable range for spell casting.
    The method accesses the spell's range information from the game's internal spell
    database and applies any relevant modifiers based on the AI unit's current state
    or configuration. It does not perform any dynamic range calculations or consider
    environmental factors such as line of sight or terrain. This method is typically
    called during AI decision-making processes to evaluate spell viability before
    attempting to cast.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to retrieve the range.
      Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the maximum casting range of the specified
    spell in yards. A return value of 0.0 indicates either an invalid spell ID or
    a spell with no defined range. Negative values should not occur under normal circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Range
    code: "float range = ai->GetSpellRange(12345);\nif (range > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Spell\
      \ has a valid range, proceed with AI logic\n    if (target->GetDistance2d(me)\
      \ <= range)\n    {\n        // Target is within range\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell Range in AI Decision Making
    code: "class MyAI : public ClassAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n     \
      \   \n        // Check if we can cast Fireball (spell ID 133)\n        float\
      \ fireballRange = GetSpellRange(133);\n        if (fireballRange > 0.0f && me->GetDistance2d(victim)\
      \ <= fireballRange)\n        {\n            DoCastVictim(133);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spell's range data from the database and does not
    account for dynamic factors like movement speed or spell modifiers that might
    affect actual casting distance. The returned value is static and corresponds to
    the base range defined in the spell entry. For creatures with multiple spell ranges
    (e.g., melee vs. ranged spells), this method should be called with appropriate
    spell IDs.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees successful spell
    casting, as other factors like line of sight, target validity, and cooldowns may
    prevent execution. Calling this method with an invalid spell ID will likely return
    0.0, which could lead to incorrect AI behavior if not properly validated.
