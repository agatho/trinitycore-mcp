  class: Guild
  method: SendEventMOTD
  signature: void Guild::SendEventMOTD(WorldSession * session, bool broadcast) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends the Guild Message of the Day (MOTD) to a specified session, optionally
    broadcasting it to all guild members.
  description: The SendEventMOTD method is responsible for transmitting the Guild's
    Message of the Day (MOTD) to a specific WorldSession. This function is typically
    invoked when a player requests or joins a guild, and it ensures that the MOTD
    is displayed to the user. The broadcast parameter determines whether the MOTD
    should be sent only to the requesting session or also broadcasted to all online
    guild members. This method plays a key role in maintaining communication within
    the guild by displaying important messages or announcements set by the guild leader
    or officers.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the WorldSession of the player who will receive the
      MOTD. This session must be valid and associated with an active player in the
      game.
  - name: broadcast
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the MOTD should be broadcasted
      to all online guild members. If true, the MOTD is sent to all guild members;
      if false, only to the specified session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send MOTD to a specific player
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendEventMOTD(player->GetSession(),\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast MOTD to all guild members
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendEventMOTD(player->GetSession(),\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal MOTD storage of the Guild class. It is
    expected that the MOTD has been properly set before calling this function. The
    broadcast functionality internally iterates through all online guild members and
    sends the MOTD to each one, which may have performance implications for large
    guilds.
  warnings: Ensure that the session pointer is valid before passing it to this method,
    as passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious with
    broadcasting in very large guilds, as it could cause performance degradation due
    to multiple network packets being sent.
