  brief: Initializes the logging system for player bot functionality
  description: The InitializeLogging method sets up the logging infrastructure required
    for player bot operations within the TrinityCore framework. This method configures
    log destinations, verbosity levels, and other logging parameters necessary for
    tracking player bot activities, debugging issues, and monitoring bot behavior.
    It ensures that all subsequent logging calls from player bot components will be
    properly handled and directed to the appropriate output channels. The method is
    typically called during the initialization phase of player bot systems and should
    be invoked before any logging operations occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig config;

      config.InitializeLogging();

      // Logging system is now ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle to
    avoid potential conflicts with existing logging configurations. The logging configuration
    is typically loaded from the TrinityCore configuration files before this method
    is invoked.
