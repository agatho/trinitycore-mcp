  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetSlot
  signature: uint8 ArenaTeam::GetSlot() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the slot index of the arena team within the player's arena team list.
  description: The GetSlot method retrieves the zero-based index position of this
    arena team in the player's collection of arena teams. This slot is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to manage and reference specific arena teams within
    a player's context. The returned value corresponds to the team's position in the
    player's arena team array, which determines how the team is accessed during PvP
    activities such as arena matches and team management operations. This method does
    not perform any validation or checks on the arena team's state, assuming it has
    been properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the zero-based index position of this arena
    team in the player's arena team list. Valid values range from 0 to the maximum
    number of arena teams a player can belong to (typically 3 for 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5
    teams).
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Arena Team Slot
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = sObjectAccessor->GetArenaTeamById(12345);

      uint8 slot = team->GetSlot();

      printf("Team is in slot %u\n", slot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The slot value returned by this method is determined at arena team creation
    or loading time and remains constant for the lifetime of the arena team object.
    It's important to note that this slot index may not correspond directly to the
    team type (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) but rather to its position in the player's internal
    arena team array.
