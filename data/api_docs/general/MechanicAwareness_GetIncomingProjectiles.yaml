  method: GetIncomingProjectiles
  signature: int MechanicAwareness::GetIncomingProjectiles(Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of incoming projectiles targeted at the specified player.
  description: The GetIncomingProjectiles method calculates and returns the number
    of projectile-based attacks currently directed toward the given player character.
    This functionality is typically used in game mechanics related to threat management,
    avoidance systems, or awareness of incoming damage. The method does not modify
    any state and is read-only in nature. It may be utilized by AI systems or player-awareness
    modules to determine defensive actions or alert players about imminent attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of projectiles currently targeting
    the specified player. Returns zero if no incoming projectiles are detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer\n\
      int projectileCount = mechanicAwareness.GetIncomingProjectiles(targetPlayer);\n\
      if (projectileCount > 0)\n{\n    // Alert player or take defensive action\n\
      \    targetPlayer->SendNotification(\"Incoming projectiles detected!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through active spell effects or projectile tracking
    systems within the TrinityCore framework to count incoming attacks. It is assumed
    to be efficient and thread-safe for use in game logic loops.
