documentation:
  brief: Removes outdated combat state data from the analyzer to maintain performance
    and accuracy.
  description: The PruneOldData method cleans up stale or obsolete combat state information
    stored within the CombatStateAnalyzer instance. This process ensures that the
    analyzer does not retain unnecessary data that could impact performance or skew
    combat analysis results. The method typically removes entries that have exceeded
    a defined time threshold or are no longer relevant to current combat scenarios.
    It is designed to be called periodically during combat events or at regular intervals
    to keep the internal data structures optimized.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event Handling
    code: "void OnCombatEvent(Player* player, Unit* target) {\n    // ... combat logic\
      \ ...\n    analyzer.PruneOldData();\n    // ... continue with analysis ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to prevent memory bloat and ensure
    accurate combat state tracking. It's recommended to invoke PruneOldData after
    significant combat events or at fixed intervals during active combat.
