  signature: bool Player::HasPendingBind() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has a pending character binding.
  description: This method checks if a player has an active character binding that
    has not yet been finalized. In World of Warcraft, when a player is created or
    when certain game events occur, there may be a pending bind operation that requires
    confirmation before the character's data is fully saved to the database. This
    method returns true if such a pending bind exists, indicating that the player's
    data is still in an intermediate state and needs to be confirmed by the player.
    The method is typically used during character creation or when handling game events
    related to character binding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a pending character binding, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the player's data is not yet fully saved to the database and
    requires confirmation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool hasPendingBind = player->HasPendingBind();\nif (hasPendingBind)\n\
      {\n    // Player has pending bind, handle accordingly\n    // ... \n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other character binding
    related methods. It may be called during player initialization or when handling
    game events that require confirmation of character data. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method simply checks a flag in the player's data structure.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other binding-related methods
    such as 'HasPendingBind' or 'IsBound'. The pending bind status is different from
    the actual binding status, and may require specific handling during character
    creation or game events.
