  class: WorldObject
  method: SendPlayOrphanSpellVisual
  signature: void WorldObject::SendPlayOrphanSpellVisual(const Position & targetLocation,
    uint32 spellVisualId, float travelSpeed, bool speedAsTime, bool withSourceOrientation)
documentation:
  brief: SendPlayOrphanSpellVisual initiates a spell visual effect at a specified
    location with configurable travel speed and orientation.
  description: This method sends an orphaned spell visual effect to a target location,
    allowing for custom travel speed and orientation settings. It is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft to display spell effects that are not tied to a specific
    target or source, such as area-of-effect spells or special visual effects. The
    method supports both time-based and distance-based speed configurations, making
    it flexible for various gameplay scenarios including combat mechanics and visual
    effects.
  parameters:
  - name: targetLocation
    description: The position where the spell visual effect should appear. This parameter
      defines the coordinates for the visual effect to be displayed at.
  - name: spellVisualId
    description: The ID of the spell visual effect to display. This identifies which
      specific visual effect will be shown, typically from the SpellVisual.dbc file
      or similar database.
  - name: travelSpeed
    description: The speed at which the visual effect travels toward the target location.
      This can be either distance-based (if speedAsTime is false) or time-based (if
      speedAsTime is true).
  - name: speedAsTime
    description: When true, travelSpeed represents time in seconds; when false, it
      represents distance in yards. This parameter controls how the travel speed is
      interpreted.
  - name: withSourceOrientation
    description: When true, the visual effect will be oriented toward the source location;
      when false, it will not have a specific orientation. This affects how the visual
      appears relative to the source.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Position targetPos;

      targetPos.m_positionX = 10.0f;

      targetPos.m_positionY = 10.0f;

      targetPos.m_positionZ = 0.0f;

      obj->SendPlayOrphanSpellVisual(targetPos, 12345, 5.0f, false, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Position targetPos;

      targetPos.m_positionX = 20.0f;

      targetPos.m_positionY = 20.0f;

      targetPos.m_positionZ = 0.0f;

      obj->SendPlayOrphanSpellVisual(targetPos, 67890, 10.0f, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for visual effects that do not require a specific
    source or target object. It can be used in conjunction with other spell-related
    methods to create complex visual effects in combat situations.
  warnings: This method should only be called from within a valid WorldObject context;
    calling it outside of such context may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
