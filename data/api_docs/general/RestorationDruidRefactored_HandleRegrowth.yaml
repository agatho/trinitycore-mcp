  signature: bool RestorationDruidRefactored::HandleRegrowth(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Regrowth spell effect to a target within the specified group
  description: The HandleRegrowth method implements the core logic for the Druid's
    Regrowth ability, which is a healing spell that restores health to targets over
    time. This method processes the healing application based on the provided group
    parameter, determining which targets receive the healing effect. The method handles
    target selection, damage calculation, and spell effect application within the
    context of TrinityCore's combat and healing systems. It ensures proper resource
    management and spell cooldown handling while integrating with the broader Druid
    class functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which targets to apply Regrowth to.
      Valid values are typically 0-4 representing different group members or target
      types, with -1 indicating self-targeting. The method uses this parameter to
      determine the healing targets within the Druid's current context.
  returns: Returns true if the Regrowth spell was successfully applied to at least
    one target, false otherwise. The method returns false when no valid targets are
    found or when prerequisites for casting are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regrowth Application
    code: "if (druid->HandleRegrowth(0)) {\n    // Regrowth successfully applied to\
      \ group member 0\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Regrowth spell applied successfully\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Regrowth with Error Handling
    code: "int targetGroup = player->GetGroup() ? player->GetGroup()->GetMemberSlot(player)\
      \ : -1;\nif (targetGroup >= 0 && druid->HandleRegrowth(targetGroup)) {\n   \
      \ // Successfully applied Regrowth to group member\n    player->SendSpellLogExecute(player,\
      \ SPELL_REGROWTH);\n} else {\n    // Failed to apply Regrowth\n    player->SendSpellFailed(player,\
      \ SPELL_REGROWTH, SPELL_FAILED_NO_VALID_TARGETS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Druid's healing rotation and should be called
    within the appropriate combat context. The group parameter directly influences
    which targets receive healing, making it essential to validate the target selection
    before calling this method. Performance considerations include efficient target
    validation and spell effect application.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter corresponds to valid targets within the
    current group context to prevent undefined behavior. Calling this method without
    proper target validation may result in failed spell casts or incorrect healing
    application.
