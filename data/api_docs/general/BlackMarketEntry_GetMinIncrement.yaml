  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetMinIncrement() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum bid increment value for a black market item entry.
  description: The GetMinIncrement method retrieves the smallest allowed bid increment
    amount for a specific black market item. This value determines how much additional
    money must be bid above the current highest bid to place a valid offer. The minimum
    increment is typically used in auction-style systems where bids must increase
    by a fixed amount or percentage. In the context of World of Warcraft's Black Market
    Auction House, this ensures fair bidding mechanics and prevents trivial small
    increments that could lead to bidding wars.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum bid increment value required for placing
    a new bid on this black market item. This value is typically expressed in copper
    coins and should be positive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int minIncrement = entry->GetMinIncrement();\n    printf(\"\
      Minimum bid increment: %d copper\\n\", minIncrement);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bid Validity
    code: "void ValidateBid(BidInfo& bid, BlackMarketEntry* entry)\n{\n    int currentBid\
      \ = entry->GetCurrentBid();\n    int minIncrement = entry->GetMinIncrement();\n\
      \    \n    if (bid.amount < (currentBid + minIncrement))\n    {\n        //\
      \ Invalid bid - below minimum increment\n        SendBidError(BID_ERROR_INVALID_INCREMENT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with GetCurrentBid() to validate
    new bids. The returned value may vary between different black market items based
    on their base price and system configuration. Implementation likely caches the
    increment value for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that bid amounts are properly validated against this minimum increment
    before accepting them, as failing to do so may result in invalid auction behavior
    or exploits. This method should only be called on valid BlackMarketEntry objects
    to avoid undefined behavior.
