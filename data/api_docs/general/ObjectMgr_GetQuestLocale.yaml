documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale data for a specified quest entry.
  description: The GetQuestLocale method fetches the localized quest data associated
    with a given quest entry ID. This method is typically used to access localized
    strings, names, and descriptions for quests in different languages. The returned
    pointer points to an array of integers that represent various locale-specific
    attributes of the quest. The method does not perform any validation on the input
    entry ID, so calling it with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior
    or memory access violations. This function is part of the ObjectMgr class which
    manages all game objects and data within TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing locale-specific data
    for the requested quest entry. The array typically holds multiple values representing
    different localized attributes such as quest title, objective text, and reward
    descriptions. Returns NULL if the quest entry does not exist or has no locale
    data defined.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Locale Data
    code: "const int* questLocale = sObjectMgr->GetQuestLocale(12345);\nif (questLocale\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Process locale data\n    printf(\"Quest title index:\
      \ %d\\n\", questLocale[0]);\n    printf(\"Objective text index: %d\\n\", questLocale[1]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal quest locale tables and should only be called
    after the game data has been fully loaded. The returned integer array contains
    indices that point to string tables in the localization system, not actual localized
    strings themselves. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical
    sections as it may involve table lookups.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid quest entry ID can lead to memory
    corruption or crashes. Always verify that the quest exists before calling this
    function. The returned pointer is only valid while the ObjectMgr instance remains
    active and should not be stored for later use without proper validation.
