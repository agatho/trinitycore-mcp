  method: ~NavMeshInterface
  signature: void NavMeshInterface::~NavMeshInterface()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the NavMeshInterface instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the NavMeshInterface class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This includes releasing navigation mesh data structures, freeing internal
    buffers, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI and pathfinding systems, this method ensures
    proper cleanup of navigation data that may have been loaded for specific maps
    or zones. The destructor is automatically invoked when an instance of NavMeshInterface
    is destroyed, such as when it goes out of scope or when the owning object is deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of NavMeshInterface
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    NavMeshInterface* navMesh = new NavMeshInterface();\n\
      \    // ... use navMesh ...\n    delete navMesh; // Destructor is called here\
      \ automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was allocated
    with 'new'. It's important to ensure that all references to the NavMeshInterface
    are cleared before it goes out of scope to prevent dangling pointers. The destruction
    process may involve cleanup operations that could take some time depending on
    the size of loaded navigation data.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you're managing memory manually
    with 'new' and 'delete'. Calling it multiple times or on already-destroyed objects
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that no other components are actively
    using the navigation mesh when destruction occurs.
