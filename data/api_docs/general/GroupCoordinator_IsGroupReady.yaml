documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the group is ready for instance entry or raid encounter.
  description: The IsGroupReady method determines if a player's group meets all necessary
    conditions to enter a dungeon, raid, or other instance content. This includes
    checking that all group members are online, within range, and have completed required
    prerequisites such as quest progress or item requirements. The method typically
    returns true when the group is fully formed and eligible for instance entry, and
    false otherwise. This check is commonly performed before allowing group members
    to enter a dungeon or raid instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is ready for instance entry (all members present,
    eligible, and meet requirements), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance entry check
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->IsGroupReady()) {\n    // Allow group to enter instance\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Group is ready for instance entry.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify players that group is not ready\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Group is not ready for instance entry.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on group member status, including online/offline
    state, level requirements, and quest completion status. It may also verify that
    all members are within the same zone or instance boundary.
