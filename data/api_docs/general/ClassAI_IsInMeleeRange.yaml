  signature: bool ClassAI::IsInMeleeRange(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit is within melee attack range of
    a specified target.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if the current AI-controlled creature
    or unit is positioned within the standard melee combat distance of its target.
    This function is typically used by AI logic to decide when to initiate melee attacks
    or move closer to an enemy. It considers the unit's current positioning, target's
    position, and the defined melee range for the unit's weapon or attack type. The
    method returns true if the target is within reach, false otherwise. This check
    is crucial for proper AI behavior in combat scenarios where maintaining appropriate
    distance is important for gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      data. The exact interpretation depends on how the AI system handles target tracking
      internally.
  returns: Returns true if the AI unit is within melee range of the specified target,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (ai->IsInMeleeRange(&targetId)) {\n    // Initiate melee attack\n  \
      \  meleesAttack();\n} else {\n    // Move closer to target\n    moveTowards(targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat AI loop
    code: "void CombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n    \n    if (IsInMeleeRange(&m_victim)) {\n        // Perform\
      \ melee attack\n        DoMeleeAttack();\n    } else {\n        // Move toward\
      \ victim\n        AttackMove(m_victim);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and assumes that the target
    parameter correctly identifies a valid unit in the game world. The actual melee
    range calculation may vary based on the creature's model, weapon type, or other
    combat attributes. Performance is generally good as it's a simple distance check,
    but frequent calls should be avoided in tight loops without proper caching.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid and active unit before
    calling this method, otherwise behavior may be undefined. This function does not
    account for obstacles or line-of-sight; it only checks raw distance metrics.
