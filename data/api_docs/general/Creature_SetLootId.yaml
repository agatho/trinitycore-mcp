  class: Creature
  method: SetLootId
  signature: void Creature::SetLootId(int lootId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot ID for a creature, determining which loot template it uses
    for drops.
  description: The SetLootId method assigns a specific loot ID to a Creature object,
    which controls the loot template that will be used when the creature is killed
    and drops items. This allows developers to customize the loot behavior of creatures,
    including setting different loot templates for different types of creatures or
    modifying loot distribution for specific NPCs. The method is typically used in
    conjunction with other creature-related functions to manage loot mechanics within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: lootId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot template to assign to this creature.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the creature_loot_template table, and determines
      what items will be dropped when the creature is killed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning Loot ID to a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetLootId(12345);

      // This sets the loot template ID 12345 for the creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called before the creature is spawned or initialized,
    as changing the loot ID after a creature has been created may not affect its current
    loot behavior. It's important to ensure that the loot ID corresponds to valid
    entries in the creature_loot_template table.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to creatures dropping incorrect items
    or no items at all if the loot ID does not correspond to a valid loot template.
    Also, setting a loot ID for a creature that is already spawned may not have any
    effect on its current loot behavior.
