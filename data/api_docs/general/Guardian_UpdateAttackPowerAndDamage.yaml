  class: Guardian

  signature: void Guardian::UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(bool ranged)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the attack power and damage values for a guardian unit based on its
    current stats and equipment.
  description: The UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage method recalculates and applies the
    attack power and damage statistics for a Guardian unit. This method is typically
    invoked when the guardian's equipment changes, stats are modified, or when the
    guardian needs to synchronize its combat attributes with updated values. The method
    considers whether the guardian is performing ranged attacks (determined by the
    'ranged' parameter) and adjusts its damage output accordingly. It ensures that
    the guardian's combat effectiveness accurately reflects its current state within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: ranged
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the guardian is performing a ranged
      attack. If true, the method calculates ranged attack power and damage; if false,
      it calculates melee attack power and damage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update for Melee Attack
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update for Ranged Attack
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game engine when guardian
    stats or equipment change. It may trigger recalculations of dependent combat values
    such as hit chance, critical strike chance, and damage modifiers. Developers should
    be aware that this method modifies internal state variables and should not be
    invoked unnecessarily during combat to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of appropriate game logic contexts (e.g.,
    during combat or when the guardian is not properly initialized) may lead to inconsistent
    behavior or incorrect combat calculations. Ensure that all relevant stats and
    equipment are synchronized before calling this method.
