  class: ThreatReference
  method: ScaleThreat
  signature: void ThreatReference::ScaleThreat(float factor)
documentation:
  brief: Scales the threat value of this ThreatReference by the given factor.
  description: The ScaleThreat method modifies the current threat value associated
    with this ThreatReference by multiplying it with the provided scaling factor.
    This is commonly used in combat systems to adjust how much threat a mob or player
    generates, such as when applying debuffs, buffs, or environmental effects that
    influence aggro. The method directly alters the internal threat value and does
    not return any result. It's important to note that this operation affects only
    the specific ThreatReference instance it is called on, and does not modify other
    references or global threat tables.
  parameters:
  - name: factor
    description: A floating-point value used to scale the current threat. A factor
      of 1.0 leaves the threat unchanged, values greater than 1.0 increase the threat,
      and values less than 1.0 decrease it. Negative values are allowed but may produce
      unexpected behavior in threat calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Threat by 50%
    code: 'ThreatReference* ref = ...;

      ref->ScaleThreat(1.5f); // Increases threat by 50%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce Threat to Half
    code: 'ThreatReference* ref = ...;

      ref->ScaleThreat(0.5f); // Reduces threat to half its original value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ThreatReference directly.
    It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access
    to threat values might occur. The scaling operation is applied immediately without
    any delay or queued updates.
  warnings: Using a factor of zero will set the threat to zero, which may cause the
    target to lose aggro completely. Using negative factors can lead to unpredictable
    behavior and should be avoided unless specifically intended for special effects
    or testing purposes.
