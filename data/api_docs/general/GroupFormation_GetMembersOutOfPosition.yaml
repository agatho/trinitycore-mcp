  class: GroupFormation
  method: GetMembersOutOfPosition
  signature: int GroupFormation::GetMembersOutOfPosition(float tolerance) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of group members that are positioned outside
    the defined formation tolerance.
  description: The GetMembersOutOfPosition method evaluates the current positioning
    of all group members against a specified tolerance threshold to determine how
    many players are not within the expected formation. This method is typically used
    in group management systems, such as those found in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    where maintaining proper player positioning during group activities like raids
    or dungeons is important. It helps identify members who may be straying too far
    from their designated positions, allowing for corrective actions or warnings to
    be issued. The tolerance parameter defines the acceptable deviation from the ideal
    formation position, and any member whose distance exceeds this value is counted
    as out of position.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of group members who are positioned
    outside the specified tolerance range. A return value of zero indicates all members
    are within the formation bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nint outOfPosition\
      \ = formation->GetMembersOutOfPosition(2.0f);\nif (outOfPosition > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Alert players or take corrective action\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"\
      Some group members are out of formation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupFormation object has been properly initialized
    with valid member data and formation parameters. It may involve performance overhead
    if called frequently in high-frequency scenarios due to position calculations
    for each group member.
  warnings: Ensure that the tolerance value is set appropriately; too small a tolerance
    may result in false positives, while too large a tolerance might miss important
    positioning issues. This method should not be used in performance-critical code
    paths without proper optimization.
