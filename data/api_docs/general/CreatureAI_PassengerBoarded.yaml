  method: PassengerBoarded
  signature: void CreatureAI::PassengerBoarded(int * param0, int param1, bool param2)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a passenger is boarded onto a creature.
  description: The PassengerBoarded method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a unit (typically a player) successfully mounts or boards a creature that
    has passenger capabilities. This method is part of the CreatureAI interface and
    allows custom AI implementations to react to passenger boarding events. It is
    typically used in conjunction with vehicle-based creatures such as mounts, siege
    vehicles, or other interactive mobs where units can board and ride. The method
    provides information about the passenger, the seat they are boarding into, and
    whether this is a forced or voluntary boarding action.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the passenger's GUID or identifier.
      This value may be used to track or identify the specific unit that boarded the
      creature.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer representing the seat index where the passenger is boarding.
      Seat indices are typically defined in the creature's vehicle template and determine
      which position the passenger occupies on the vehicle.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the boarding was forced (true) or
      voluntary (false). This can be used to differentiate between scripted mount
      events and player-initiated boarding actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::PassengerBoarded(int* passengerGuid, int seatId, bool\
      \ isForced)\n{\n    if (isForced)\n        DoCast(SPELL_FORCED_BOARDING);\n\
      \    else\n        DoCast(SPELL_VOLUNTARY_BOARDING);\n\n    // Log boarding\
      \ event\n    sLog->outString(\"Passenger %u boarded creature at seat %d\", *passengerGuid,\
      \ seatId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Event Handling with Seat Logic
    code: "void AdvancedCreatureAI::PassengerBoarded(int* passengerGuid, int seatId,\
      \ bool isForced)\n{\n    // Check if the creature has specific behavior for\
      \ different seats\n    switch (seatId)\n    {\n        case 0:\n           \
      \ // Driver seat\n            SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n           \
      \ break;\n        case 1:\n            // Passenger seat\n            DoCast(SPELL_SEAT_BOOST);\n\
      \            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n\n    // Trigger\
      \ quest event if needed\n    if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(*passengerGuid))\n\
      \        player->KilledMonsterCredit(m_creature->GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the core AI system during passenger boarding logic.
    It's important to note that the GUID passed in param0 might be a pointer to an
    internal identifier, so direct dereferencing should be handled carefully. Additionally,
    this method may be invoked multiple times if multiple passengers board the same
    creature.
  warnings: Ensure that any actions taken within this method do not cause infinite
    loops or recursive calls. Be cautious when modifying creature state during boarding
    events as it can affect vehicle mechanics and player experience.
