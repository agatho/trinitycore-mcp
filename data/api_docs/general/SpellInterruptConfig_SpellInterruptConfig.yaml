documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpellInterruptConfig instance with default values.
  description: The SpellInterruptConfig constructor initializes a new instance of
    the SpellInterruptConfig class. This class is used to configure spell interruption
    behavior within the TrinityCore framework, particularly for managing how spells
    are interrupted by various game events such as movement, damage, or other actions.
    The constructor sets up default configuration values that can be modified later
    through member functions or direct access to the configuration properties. This
    initialization is typically performed when creating spell-related systems or during
    server startup to ensure proper spell interruption handling.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SpellInterruptConfig config;

      // config is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the object's internal state to default values. The
    actual spell interruption logic is handled by other methods in the class that
    are called during gameplay events.
