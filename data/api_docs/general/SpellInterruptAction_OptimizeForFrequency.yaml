documentation:
  brief: Optimizes spell interrupt handling based on frequency of interrupts
  description: The OptimizeForFrequency method adjusts internal spell interrupt behavior
    to improve performance and resource utilization when dealing with high-frequency
    interrupt scenarios. This optimization typically involves reordering or prioritizing
    interrupt checks, reducing redundant calculations, or applying more efficient
    data structures for tracking interruptible spells. The method is designed to enhance
    the efficiency of the spell system during combat situations where interrupts occur
    frequently, such as when players are rapidly casting spells or when multiple effects
    are simultaneously interrupting ongoing spell casts.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Scenario
    code: "void MySpellHandler::HandleCombatInterrupts()\n{\n    // Optimize for high-frequency\
      \ interrupts during combat\n    SpellInterruptAction::OptimizeForFrequency();\n\
      \    // Continue with normal interrupt processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal caching strategies or priority queues
    used in spell interruption logic. It should be called before entering high-interrupt-frequency
    scenarios, such as during intense PvP combat or when processing multiple simultaneous
    spell interrupts.
  warnings: Calling this method inappropriately may cause performance degradation
    or unexpected behavior. It's recommended to only call this method when the system
    is expected to experience frequent spell interruptions, and not on every interrupt
    event.
