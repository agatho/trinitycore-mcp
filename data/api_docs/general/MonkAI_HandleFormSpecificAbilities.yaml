  signature: void MonkAI::HandleFormSpecificAbilities(MartialForm form, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles form-specific abilities for a monk AI based on the current martial
    form.
  description: The HandleFormSpecificAbilities method processes and executes abilities
    that are unique to specific martial forms for a monk AI. This function evaluates
    the current martial form of the monk and applies appropriate behavior or actions
    tied to that form, such as activating special attacks, modifying movement patterns,
    or triggering form-specific cooldowns. The method is typically invoked during
    AI decision-making cycles to ensure the monk's actions align with their active
    martial form state. It requires a valid martial form to be passed in and may modify
    target selection or ability priorities based on form-specific mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: form
    description: The current martial form the monk is in. Valid values are typically
      defined by an enum such as MASTERY_FORM_NONE, MASTERY_FORM_WIND, MASTERY_FORM_STORM,
      etc., representing different monk forms like Wind, Storm, or Serpent forms.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier.
      This value may be modified by the function to adjust targeting behavior based
      on form-specific rules, such as prioritizing certain enemies or changing target
      selection logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        int target = GetTargetIndex();\n        HandleFormSpecificAbilities(GetCurrentMartialForm(),\
      \ &target);\n        // Use updated target for next action\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling form transitions with ability adjustments
    code: "void MonkAI::OnFormChange(MartialForm newForm)\n{\n    int target = GetTargetIndex();\n\
      \    HandleFormSpecificAbilities(newForm, &target);\n    SetTargetIndex(target);\n\
      \    // Apply form-specific cooldowns or buffs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the monk AI has already determined which martial
    form is active and that the target value is valid. The function may modify the
    target pointer to reflect changes in targeting behavior due to form-specific rules.
    Performance-wise, this function should be lightweight as it's called frequently
    during AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the MartialForm enum values passed are valid and supported
    by the game mechanics. Passing an invalid form value could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect ability activation. Also, modifying the target pointer directly may
    affect other systems relying on consistent targeting logic.
