  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseEnergyPercent(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the percentage of energy regeneration for a player or creature when
    applying or removing an aura effect.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseEnergyPercent method is responsible for adjusting
    the energy regeneration rate of a unit by a specified percentage when an aura
    effect is applied or removed. This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura system
    and is typically invoked during aura application or removal events. It modifies
    the energy regeneration value based on the provided percentage modifier, which
    can either increase or decrease the amount of energy restored per tick. The method
    operates on a unit's energy regeneration properties and affects how quickly the
    unit regenerates energy over time.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state, target,
      and application context.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect. This typically determines
      how the effect is processed (e.g., whether it's being applied, removed, or updated).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the energy percentage modifier is added; when false,
      it is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Energy Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      aura->HandleAuraModIncreaseEnergyPercent(app, 1, true); // Apply 100% energy
      increase'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Energy Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      aura->HandleAuraModIncreaseEnergyPercent(app, 1, false); // Remove energy increase'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore aura system
    during aura application or removal. Developers should not directly invoke this
    method unless implementing custom aura logic. The percentage modifier is usually
    defined in the aura's spell effect data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect energy regeneration
    behavior, especially if the percentage modifier is not properly validated. Ensure
    that the aura application context is valid before calling this method.
