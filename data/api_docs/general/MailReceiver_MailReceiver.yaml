  class: MailReceiver
  method: MailReceiver
  signature: void MailReceiver::MailReceiver(Player * receiver, int receiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MailReceiver object with the specified player and receiver
    GUID.
  description: The MailReceiver constructor initializes a mail receiver instance by
    associating it with a specific player and their unique identifier (GUID). This
    method sets up internal state for handling mail delivery to the specified player.
    The receiver parameter represents the Player object that will receive the mail,
    while the receiverGuid parameter is the integer representation of the player's
    GUID used for identification within the game world. This constructor is typically
    called when creating mail objects for delivery to players in TrinityCore's mail
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will receive the mail. Must be
      a valid player instance or nullptr.
  - name: receiverGuid
    description: Integer representation of the player's unique identifier (GUID).
      Used for mail delivery routing within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MailReceiver Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      int guid = player->GetGUID();

      MailReceiver receiver(player, guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating MailReceiver for Mail System
    code: "void SendMailToPlayer(Player* targetPlayer) {\n    int targetGuid = targetPlayer->GetGUID();\n\
      \    MailReceiver receiver(targetPlayer, targetGuid);\n    // Use receiver for\
      \ mail operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor does not perform any validation on the input parameters.
    It is assumed that the Player pointer is valid and the GUID corresponds to an
    existing player in the game world. This method is part of TrinityCore's internal
    mail system implementation and should not be called directly by external code
    without proper context.
  warnings: Passing a nullptr for the receiver parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    when accessing player data later. Ensure that the receiverGuid matches the GUID
    of the Player object to avoid mail delivery issues. This constructor is typically
    used internally by the mail system and should not be called directly in most cases.
