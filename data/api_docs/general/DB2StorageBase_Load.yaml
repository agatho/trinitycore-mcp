  method: Load
  signature: void DB2StorageBase::Load(const std::string & path, LocaleConstant locale)
documentation:
  brief: Loads DB2 data from the specified file path for the given locale
  description: The Load method initializes and populates a DB2 storage container with
    data from a specified file path, targeting a particular locale. This method is
    typically used during server startup or runtime to load localized database table
    data required by various subsystems. The method handles parsing of the DB2 file
    format, which is used in World of Warcraft for storing structured game data such
    as item templates, creature data, and other static game information. It ensures
    that the loaded data is properly indexed and accessible for fast lookup operations.
    The locale parameter determines which localized version of the data to load, allowing
    for proper internationalization support.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: The absolute or relative file path to the DB2 data file to be loaded.
      This should point to a valid .db2 file containing structured game data.
  - name: locale
    description: The locale constant specifying which localized version of the data
      to load. Valid values are typically defined in LocaleConstant enum such as LOCALE_enUS,
      LOCALE_koKR, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DB2 Storage Load
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* itemStorage = new DB2StorageBase();

      itemStorage->Load("dbc/item.db2", LOCALE_enUS);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Multiple Locale Data
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* creatureStorage = new DB2StorageBase();

      creatureStorage->Load("dbc/creature.db2", LOCALE_enUS);

      creatureStorage->Load("dbc/creature.db2", LOCALE_frFR);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when locale
    changes occur. The DB2 files are binary format tables that must be properly aligned
    and formatted. The method performs internal error checking and will silently fail
    if the file cannot be read or parsed correctly. It's recommended to verify successful
    loading by checking the storage state after calling this method.
  warnings: Calling Load on an already-loaded storage may result in data corruption
    or memory leaks. Always ensure proper cleanup before reloading. The method does
    not validate that the file is a valid DB2 format - invalid files may cause undefined
    behavior. This method should typically be called from the main thread as it may
    perform blocking I/O operations.
