documentation:
  brief: Moves the language data from a source LanguageMgr object to the current object,
    invalidating the source.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a LanguageMgr
    object. It transfers ownership of all internal resources and data from the right-hand
    side (source) LanguageMgr object to the current object. After the move, the source
    object is left in a valid but unspecified state, typically with empty or reset
    internal structures. This operation is commonly used for efficient resource management
    when transferring language-related data between objects without unnecessary copying.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method supports
    efficient handling of language configurations and localization data during object
    lifecycle management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LanguageMgr object, allowing for chaining of
    assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LanguageMgr manager1;

      LanguageMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'LanguageMgr mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // ... populate managers with data ...

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr2);

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr3); // Chaining assignments

      // Note: mgr2 and mgr3 are left in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's designed
    to be efficient, avoiding deep copying of internal data structures. The source
    object after move should not be used for operations that require its previous
    state. This operator is typically generated automatically by the compiler when
    no user-defined assignment operator exists, but may be explicitly implemented
    for specific optimization or control purposes.
  warnings: After a move operation, the source LanguageMgr object should not be accessed
    or used in any way that assumes it contains valid data. The behavior of using
    such an object is undefined and can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Developers
    should ensure proper handling of moved-from objects in their code.
