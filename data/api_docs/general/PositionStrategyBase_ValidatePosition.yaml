  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: ValidatePosition
  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::ValidatePosition(const int & pos, Player *
    bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a given position is acceptable for the bot's current strategy.
  description: The ValidatePosition method checks whether a specified position is
    valid according to the positioning strategy rules defined for the bot. It evaluates
    the provided position against internal constraints such as distance thresholds,
    terrain suitability, or strategic objectives. This method is typically used during
    pathfinding or positioning decisions to ensure that chosen locations meet the
    criteria required by the AI behavior. The validation considers the bot's current
    state and environment, ensuring that positions are not only technically feasible
    but also strategically sound for the given context.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the position index or identifier to validate.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific location within the bot's navigation
      system or strategy map.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose positioning
      strategy is being validated. The method uses this reference to access the bot's
      current state, attributes, and environment for validation purposes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is valid according to the strategy
    rules; otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate that the
    position is out of range, blocked by terrain, or otherwise unsuitable for the
    bot's current tactical situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "if (strategy->ValidatePosition(5, bot)) {\n    // Proceed with action using\
      \ position 5\n    bot->MoveToPosition(5);\n} else {\n    // Find an alternative\
      \ position\n    int alternative = strategy->FindNextValidPosition(bot);\n  \
      \  bot->MoveToPosition(alternative);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI positioning system and relies on internal state
    tracking. It should be called frequently during decision-making loops to ensure
    that positions remain valid as the environment changes. Performance is generally
    low, but repeated calls can impact frame rate if not optimized.
  warnings: Do not assume that a validated position will always be reachable or safe
    in the immediate future. The method only validates against static criteria and
    does not account for dynamic obstacles or enemy presence.
