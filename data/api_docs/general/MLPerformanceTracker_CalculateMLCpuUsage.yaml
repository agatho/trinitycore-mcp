  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: CalculateMLCpuUsage
  signature: float MLPerformanceTracker::CalculateMLCpuUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the machine learning
    system.
  description: The CalculateMLCpuUsage method computes the CPU utilization rate for
    the machine learning subsystem within the TrinityCore environment. This function
    is typically used for performance monitoring and optimization purposes, allowing
    developers to track how much processing power is being consumed by ML-related
    operations. The returned value represents a floating-point number between 0.0
    and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no CPU usage and 100.0 indicates full utilization.
    This method does not modify any internal state and can be called at regular intervals
    to monitor performance trends.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU usage percentage of the machine
    learning system, ranging from 0.0 (no usage) to 100.0 (full utilization).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      float cpuUsage = tracker.CalculateMLCpuUsage();

      std::cout << "Current ML CPU Usage: " << cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Continuous Monitoring with Logging
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\nwhile (true) {\n    float usage = tracker.CalculateMLCpuUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 80.0f) {\n        LOG_WARN(\"ml\", \"High ML CPU usage detected:\
      \ {}%\", usage);\n    }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve system-level calls to retrieve CPU statistics, which
    could introduce minor performance overhead. It's recommended to cache results
    or call this function at appropriate intervals rather than continuously. The implementation
    likely uses platform-specific APIs for accurate measurement.
  warnings: The returned value is an instantaneous snapshot and may fluctuate rapidly.
    For trend analysis, consider averaging multiple readings over time. This method
    should not be called from high-frequency loops without proper throttling to avoid
    impacting performance.
