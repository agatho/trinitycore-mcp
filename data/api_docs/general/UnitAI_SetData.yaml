  class: UnitAI
  method: SetData
  signature: void UnitAI::SetData(uint32 id, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a data value associated with a specific ID for the AI unit.
  description: The SetData method allows UnitAI implementations to store and manage
    custom integer data values identified by a unique ID. This functionality is commonly
    used in AI scripts to track state information, flags, or configuration values
    that influence behavior decisions. The method typically serves as part of a broader
    data management system within the TrinityCore framework, enabling AI components
    to persist and retrieve contextual information during creature or NPC interactions.
    It's often paired with GetData methods for complete data handling capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier used to associate the data value. This ID is
      typically defined by the AI implementation or script and determines how the
      data will be retrieved later.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value to be stored for the given ID. Can represent any
      meaningful state information such as flags, counters, or configuration settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a simple flag value
    code: "void ExampleAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Set a flag to indicate\
      \ combat has started\n    SetData(1, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating a counter for patrol points
    code: "void PatrolAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_patrolPointCounter <\
      \ m_totalPoints)\n    {\n        // Update the current patrol point\n      \
      \  SetData(2, m_patrolPointCounter);\n        ++m_patrolPointCounter;\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with GetData() to maintain persistent
    state information within AI implementations. The ID parameter should be carefully
    chosen to avoid conflicts with other systems using the same data storage mechanism.
  warnings: Ensure that IDs used for SetData are consistent with those expected by
    GetData calls, otherwise data retrieval will fail or return incorrect values.
    Avoid using large or negative values for the ID parameter which may cause unexpected
    behavior in underlying storage mechanisms.
