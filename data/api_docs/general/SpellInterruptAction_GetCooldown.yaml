documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown duration for the spell interrupt action in seconds
  description: The GetCooldown method returns the cooldown time associated with a
    spell interrupt action. This value represents how long (in seconds) the spell
    interrupt action must wait before it can be used again. The cooldown is typically
    set during spell initialization or based on game mechanics such as spell properties,
    talent ranks, or class-specific modifiers. This method provides access to the
    base cooldown value without considering any haste or reduction effects that may
    be applied during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the cooldown duration in seconds. Returns 0.0
    if no cooldown is set or if the action has no cooldown restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float cooldown = spellInterruptAction.GetCooldown();\nif (cooldown > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Apply cooldown logic\n    printf(\"Spell interrupt has %.2f seconds\
      \ remaining\\n\", cooldown);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Check Before Execution
    code: "SpellInterruptAction* action = player->GetSpellInterruptAction();\nfloat\
      \ cooldown = action->GetCooldown();\nif (cooldown <= 0.0f)\n{\n    // Can execute\
      \ the interrupt action\n    action->Execute();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Display cooldown\
      \ message to player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Spell interrupt is on cooldown.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns only the base cooldown value. Actual cooldowns may be
    modified by haste effects, buffs, or debuffs in the game engine. The returned
    value is typically used in conjunction with other methods like GetSpellCooldown()
    or ApplyCooldown() to manage spell interrupt timing.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not account for haste modifications or
    temporary cooldown reductions that might occur during gameplay. Always check if
    the action is actually available before attempting to execute it, as cooldowns
    may be managed through other systems in TrinityCore.
