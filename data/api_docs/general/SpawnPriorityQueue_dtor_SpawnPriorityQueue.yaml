documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpawnPriorityQueue instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpawnPriorityQueue class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the queue. This
    method is automatically invoked when a SpawnPriorityQueue object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation to prevent memory
    leaks within the TrinityCore server environment. The destructor does not take
    any parameters and performs no user-facing operations beyond cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of SpawnPriorityQueue
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SpawnPriorityQueue queue;\n    // ... use the\
      \ queue ...\n    // queue is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing
    explicit object destruction in custom memory management scenarios.
