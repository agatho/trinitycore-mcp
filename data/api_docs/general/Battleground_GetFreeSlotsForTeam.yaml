  method: GetFreeSlotsForTeam
  signature: int Battleground::GetFreeSlotsForTeam(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of free slots available for the specified team in the
    battleground.
  description: The GetFreeSlotsForTeam method calculates and returns the count of
    available player slots for a given team within the battleground instance. This
    method is essential for determining whether players can join a specific team,
    particularly in battlegrounds with team-based gameplay such as Warsong Gulch or
    Arathi Basin. The returned value represents how many more players can be added
    to the specified team before reaching the maximum capacity. This information is
    crucial for matchmaking systems and UI displays showing available slots.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of free slots available for the specified
    team. Returns 0 or a positive integer depending on how many more players can join
    that team. A negative value would indicate an error condition, though this is
    unlikely given the method's design.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Slots for Alliance Team
    code: "int freeSlots = bg->GetFreeSlotsForTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nif (freeSlots\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Allow players to join the alliance team\n    sWorld->SendWorldMessage(\"\
      Alliance has %d free slots available.\"\n        , freeSlots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all players currently in the battleground
    and counts those who are not yet assigned to a team or are in a state where they
    can be reassigned. It's important to note that this value may change dynamically
    as players join or leave the battleground.
  warnings: While this method provides useful information about available slots, it
    should not be used for critical game logic decisions without considering potential
    race conditions or concurrent modifications to the battleground state. Additionally,
    calling this method during active gameplay may return outdated values if player
    states are changing rapidly.
