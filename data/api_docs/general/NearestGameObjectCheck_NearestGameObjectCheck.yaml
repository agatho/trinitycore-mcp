documentation:
  brief: Initializes a NearestGameObjectCheck object with another instance's parameters.
  description: The NearestGameObjectCheck constructor initializes a new instance of
    the NearestGameObjectCheck class by copying the state and parameters from an existing
    NearestGameObjectCheck object. This class is typically used in TrinityCore's AI
    and game object interaction systems to find the nearest game object within a specified
    search area or criteria. The constructor ensures that all internal state variables,
    such as search radius, target type, and filtering conditions, are properly copied
    from the source instance. This allows for consistent behavior when performing
    repeated searches for nearby game objects across different contexts or iterations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source NearestGameObjectCheck object whose state will be copied
      to initialize this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization from Existing Instance
    code: 'NearestGameObjectCheck originalCheck(50.0f, TYPE_GAMEOBJECT);

      NearestGameObjectCheck newCheck(originalCheck);

      // newCheck now has the same parameters as originalCheck'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Game Object Search Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        NearestGameObjectCheck check(100.0f, TYPE_GAMEOBJECT);\n\
      \        NearestGameObjectCheck copyCheck(check);\n        \n        if (Unit*\
      \ target = me->SelectNearestTarget(&copyCheck)) {\n            // Process the\
      \ nearest target found\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of all member variables. If any
    member variables are pointers or contain dynamically allocated memory, developers
    should be aware that both instances will reference the same memory locations unless
    deep copying is implemented elsewhere. The class likely implements a standard
    copy constructor pattern used throughout TrinityCore's AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object passed to this constructor remains valid
    for the lifetime of the new instance. If the source object is destroyed or modified
    after construction, it may lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations
    using the copied instance.
