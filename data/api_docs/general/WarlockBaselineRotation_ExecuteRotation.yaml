documentation:
  brief: Executes the warlock baseline rotation logic for a bot character
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a warlock AI bot's combat behavior. It evaluates the current state of the
    bot and target, then determines and executes the appropriate spell or ability
    to cast based on predefined rotation priorities. This method integrates with the
    BaselineRotationManager to coordinate rotation execution and maintain proper cooldown
    tracking. The method returns true if a valid action was executed, false otherwise.
    The implementation typically follows a priority-based system where higher-priority
    abilities are selected first, considering factors such as spell availability,
    target health, and combat conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character's data structure containing current
      state information including health, mana, and available spells
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character's data structure containing target
      state information such as health, distance, and status effects
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager instance that handles rotation
      state tracking, cooldowns, and coordination between different rotation components
  returns: Returns true if a valid spell or ability was successfully executed during
    this rotation cycle, false if no action could be performed due to unmet conditions
    or resource constraints
  examples:
  - title: Basic rotation execution
    code: "WarlockBaselineRotation rotation;\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\nint\
      \ botData[10];\nint targetData[10];\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Action was executed successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Warlock performed an action\\n\");\n} else {\n    // No valid\
      \ action could be performed\n    printf(\"No action taken\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI loop
    code: "void WarlockAIBot::Update() {\n    WarlockBaselineRotation rotation;\n\
      \    BaselineRotationManager manager;\n    \n    if (rotation.ExecuteRotation(&botData[0],\
      \ &targetData[0], manager)) {\n        // Successfully executed a rotation step\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Fallback behavior when no rotation action\
      \ is possible\n    HandleFallbackBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager should be properly configured
    with rotation settings and cooldown tracking enabled. Performance considerations
    include avoiding expensive calculations within the method, as it may be called
    frequently during combat. The method is designed to be stateless between calls,
    relying on the manager for persistent rotation state.
  warnings: Ensure that bot and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to prevent segmentation faults. The method does not perform bounds checking on
    array indices, so input arrays must have sufficient capacity. Be aware that improper
    management of the BaselineRotationManager can lead to incorrect cooldown tracking
    and rotation behavior.
