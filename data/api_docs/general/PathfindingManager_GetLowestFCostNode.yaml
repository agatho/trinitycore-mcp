  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetLowestFCostNode
  signature: PathNode * PathfindingManager::GetLowestFCostNode(int & openSet)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the node with the lowest F cost from the open set in pathfinding
    calculations.
  description: The GetLowestFCostNode method is used within the PathfindingManager
    class to identify and return the PathNode with the lowest F cost value from an
    internal open set. This method plays a critical role in A* pathfinding algorithms
    by selecting the most promising node to expand next, based on the heuristic estimate
    of the total cost from the start node to the goal through that node. It is typically
    called during the pathfinding process to determine which node should be evaluated
    next for potential paths. The method modifies the open set parameter to reflect
    the removal of the selected node, ensuring that nodes are processed in order of
    their estimated total cost.
  parameters:
  - name: openSet
    description: Reference to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      current open set within the PathfindingManager's internal data structures. This
      parameter is modified by the method to indicate which node was selected and
      removed from the set.
  returns: A pointer to the PathNode object with the lowest F cost in the open set,
    or nullptr if the open set is empty or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pathfinding Loop
    code: "int openSetIndex = 0;\nPathNode* currentNode = pathfindingManager->GetLowestFCostNode(openSetIndex);\n\
      if (currentNode != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the node\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is integral to A* pathfinding performance and should be called
    efficiently. The openSet parameter represents an index or identifier that may
    be used internally by PathfindingManager to track which set of nodes is currently
    being evaluated.
  warnings: Ensure the openSet parameter is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as incorrect indexing can lead to undefined behavior. The returned PathNode
    pointer should always be checked for null before use to prevent dereferencing
    invalid memory.
