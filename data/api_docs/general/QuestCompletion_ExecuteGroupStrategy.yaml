    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a group quest completion strategy for a player bot, updating quest
    progress data.
  description: The ExecuteGroupStrategy method in the QuestCompletion class handles
    the logic for completing quests within a group context. It takes a player bot
    and associated quest progress data as inputs, processes the necessary actions
    to complete the quest, and updates the progress accordingly. This method is typically
    used in AI-driven quest completion systems where bots need to coordinate with
    group members to fulfill quest requirements. The method ensures that all group-related
    quest mechanics are properly handled, including shared rewards and progression
    tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest completion strategy. Must be a valid player instance with active quest
      progress data.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData structure containing current quest
      progress information for the bot. This data is modified in-place during execution
      to reflect updated quest state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteGroupStrategy
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player bot

      QuestProgressData progress = ...; // Initialize progress data

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.ExecuteGroupStrategy(bot, progress);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExecuteGroupStrategy with group coordination
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nQuestProgressData progress;\nprogress.questId = 12345;\n\
      progress.completed = false;\n\nQuestCompletion questComp;\nquestComp.ExecuteGroupStrategy(bot,\
      \ progress);\n\nif (progress.completed) {\n    // Handle quest completion logic\n\
      \    bot->CompleteQuest(progress.questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot is part of a group and that group
    quest mechanics are properly initialized. The progress data structure should be
    pre-populated with valid quest information before calling this method. Implementation
    may involve group communication and synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the bot or progress
    data can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is actually in a group
    context before executing group strategies, as this method may not handle solo
    quest completion properly.
