  class: MageAI
  method: UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic
  signature: void MageAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the advanced combat logic for a Mage AI unit based on the current
    target.
  description: The UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic method is responsible for managing and
    executing sophisticated combat behaviors specific to Mage AI units. It evaluates
    the current combat situation, including target position, health, and available
    spells, to determine optimal spell casting sequences and movement strategies.
    This method typically integrates with the broader AI framework to ensure that
    mages make intelligent decisions during combat, such as choosing when to cast
    damaging spells, applying beneficial buffs, or repositioning for better line of
    sight. The method operates on a provided target unit and modifies the mage's behavior
    accordingly, ensuring tactical awareness and efficient resource usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is essential for determining spell selection, positioning, and
      targeting logic. The target must be a valid unit in the game world; otherwise,
      behavior may be undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Mage AI logic here\n    // Example: Cast Fireball\
      \ if within range\n    if (me->IsWithinLOS(target) && me->IsWithinDist(target,\
      \ 30.0f))\n    {\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic. The method assumes that
    the MageAI instance has access to spell data and combat state information. Performance
    considerations include avoiding expensive operations within this function, as
    it may be called frequently during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before using it in this method.
    Passing a null or invalid target can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    be cautious when modifying unit states directly within this method, as it might
    interfere with the AI's overall control flow.
