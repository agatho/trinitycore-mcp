    items contained within an auction posting. This includes stacked items and multiple
    entries for the same item type. The method is typically used to determine how
    many items are being offered in a single auction listing, which affects bidding
    mechanics and inventory management. It aggregates item counts from all auction
    lots associated with this posting.

  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of items across all
    lots in this auction posting. This count includes stacked items and multiple entries
    for identical item types.

    code: 'AuctionPosting* posting = sAuctionMgr->GetAuction(12345);

    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve iterating through all auction lots associated with
    the posting, so performance should be considered when called frequently. The result
    is cached internally for efficiency.
