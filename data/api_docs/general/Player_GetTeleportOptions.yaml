  signature: uint32 Player::GetTeleportOptions() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns teleportation options available to the player.
  description: This method retrieves the teleportation options that are currently
    enabled for the player character. It returns a bitmask value representing the
    various teleportation capabilities and restrictions set by the game server. The
    returned value typically includes information about which teleport locations are
    accessible, whether the player can teleport to specific zones, and what teleportation
    methods are available (such as binding points, flight paths, or instance teleportations).
    This method is commonly used in conjunction with other teleport-related functions
    to determine the player's teleportation state and capabilities within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the teleportation options bitmask.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to different teleportation capabilities
    or restrictions, such as binding points, flight paths, instance teleportations,
    or zone-specific teleportation options. The exact meaning of each bit depends
    on the game server's configuration and implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 teleportOptions = player->GetTeleportOptions();\nif (teleportOptions\
      \ & 0x01)\n{\n    // Player can teleport to the capital city\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other teleportation-related
    methods to determine player's teleportation capabilities. The bitmask value returned
    by this method may vary depending on the player's level, faction, and current
    game state. Implementation details may vary based on server configuration and
    game mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting the bitmask values as they may
    change between different server configurations or expansions. Some bits may not
    be directly related to teleportation but rather represent other game mechanics
    such as binding points or instance restrictions.
