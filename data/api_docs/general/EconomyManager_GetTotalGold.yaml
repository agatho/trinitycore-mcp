  class: EconomyManager
  method: GetTotalGold
  signature: uint64 EconomyManager::GetTotalGold() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total amount of gold across all players and accounts
    in the game economy.
  description: The GetTotalGold method aggregates the gold holdings of all players
    and accounts within the TrinityCore server instance. This method provides a comprehensive
    view of the in-game economy's total monetary supply, which can be useful for economic
    analysis, balance tuning, or administrative purposes. The calculation includes
    all gold stored in player inventories, banks, and any other accessible gold sources.
    It is designed to be a read-only operation that does not modify any game state.
    This method may involve database queries to gather the necessary information from
    multiple tables, so performance should be considered when calling it frequently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total amount of gold (in copper units)
    across all players and accounts in the server. The value is expressed in copper
    coins, where 100 copper equals 1 silver and 100 silver equals 1 gold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Total Gold
    code: 'uint64 totalGold = economyMgr->GetTotalGold();

      ChatHandler ch = ChatHandler(player);

      ch.PSendSysMessage("Total gold in the economy: %llu", totalGold);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Total Gold for Economic Analysis
    code: 'uint64 totalGold = economyMgr->GetTotalGold();

      uint64 playerCount = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerCount();

      float averageGoldPerPlayer = static_cast<float>(totalGold) / static_cast<float>(playerCount);

      LOG_INFO("server", "Average gold per player: {}", averageGoldPerPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called frequently due to
    potential database access. It's recommended to cache the result or call it only
    when necessary for administrative or analytical purposes. The returned value represents
    all gold in copper units, so conversion to gold/silver/copper denominations should
    be handled appropriately.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency operations as it
    may involve database queries that could impact server performance. Avoid calling
    this method in time-critical code paths such as combat or movement handlers.
