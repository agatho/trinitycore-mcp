api:
  class: Player
  method: SetWatchedFactionIndex
  signature: void Player::SetWatchedFactionIndex(int32 index)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the watched faction index for the player.
  description: This method allows a player to set which faction they are watching
    in their reputation list. The faction index determines the current faction being
    displayed in the player's reputation UI, and affects how the player's reputation
    is updated when interacting with NPCs or completing quests related to that faction.
    This method is typically used during quest progression or reputation management
    to ensure proper tracking of faction progress.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The index of the faction to be watched, ranging from 0 to 255. A
      value of -1 indicates no faction is being watched.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Watched Faction Index
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetWatchedFactionIndex(0); // Set to first faction in the list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other reputation-related
    methods like AddReputation or SetReputation. The index parameter corresponds to
    the faction's position in the player's faction list, and setting it correctly
    ensures proper tracking of reputation progress.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect reputation tracking,
    especially if used without understanding the faction list structure. Ensure that
    the index value corresponds to a valid faction before calling this method.
