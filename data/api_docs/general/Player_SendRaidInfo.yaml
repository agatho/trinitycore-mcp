    code: "void SendRaidInfo() {\n    // This method is called internally by TrinityCore\n\
      \    // when a player joins a raid instance\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core system when players
    join raid instances. It's important to note that this method may be called multiple
    times during a player's session, particularly when raid members change or when
    new loot settings are applied.
