  class: AbstractFollower
  method: GetTarget
  signature: Unit * AbstractFollower::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current target unit that the abstract follower is following
    or engaged with.
  description: The GetTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object that represents
    the current target of the AbstractFollower instance. This target could be an enemy
    unit the follower is attacking, a friendly unit it is following, or any other
    unit it has designated as its focus. The returned pointer may be nullptr if no
    valid target exists. This method is commonly used in AI logic to determine what
    the follower should act upon next, such as whether to attack, follow, or cease
    actions based on the target's state. It is a read-only accessor that does not
    modify any internal state of the follower.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current target of the AbstractFollower,
    or nullptr if no target is set or valid.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a follower has a target before attacking
    code: "if (Unit* target = follower->GetTarget())\n{\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ logic\n    follower->Attack(target, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No target available,\
      \ perhaps move to next behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use target in AI decision making
    code: "Unit* target = follower->GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsDead())\n\
      {\n    // Target is dead, clear it and find a new one\n    follower->SetTarget(nullptr);\n\
      }\nelse if (target && !target->IsInWorld())\n{\n    // Target is no longer in\
      \ the world, remove reference\n    follower->SetTarget(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a direct access to the internal target pointer without
    performing any validation or state changes. It's important to check for nullptr
    before dereferencing the returned Unit pointer to avoid crashes. The target may
    be invalidated by external systems (e.g., if the target dies or is removed from
    the world), so it should not be cached for long periods.
  warnings: Always verify that the returned Unit pointer is not null before using
    it. If the target unit is destroyed or removed from the world, this method will
    still return a stale pointer which can lead to crashes or undefined behavior if
    accessed.
