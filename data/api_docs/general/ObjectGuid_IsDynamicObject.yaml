  class: ObjectGuid
  method: IsDynamicObject
  signature: bool ObjectGuid::IsDynamicObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a dynamic object in the World
    of Warcraft world.
  description: The IsDynamicObject method checks if the ObjectGuid instance corresponds
    to a dynamic object within the TrinityCore framework. Dynamic objects are temporary
    game entities such as traps, doors, or environmental effects that exist for a
    limited time or under specific conditions. This method examines the type bits
    of the GUID to identify whether it belongs to the dynamic object category. The
    check is essential for proper handling and processing of different object types
    in game logic, particularly when iterating through world objects or performing
    type-specific operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a dynamic object; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a GUID is a Dynamic Object
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::DynamicObject>(0, 12345);\n\
      if (guid.IsDynamicObject()) {\n    // Handle dynamic object logic\n    printf(\"\
      This is a dynamic object\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle other object types\n\
      \    printf(\"This is not a dynamic object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid, specifically checking
    the high GUID type bits. It's important to note that this check only verifies
    the object type category and does not validate if the actual object exists in
    the world or is active.
