  class: BotThreatManager
  method: BotThreatManager
  signature: void BotThreatManager::BotThreatManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotThreatManager instance for the specified bot player.
  description: The BotThreatManager constructor initializes a threat management system
    for a specific bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This manager handles
    the tracking and management of threat levels generated by the bot's combat actions,
    ensuring proper aggro behavior and NPC targeting mechanics. The constructor sets
    up internal data structures to monitor the bot's threat contributions to various
    targets, which is essential for maintaining realistic AI behavior in World of
    Warcraft-style gameplay. It prepares the system to handle threat updates, recalculations,
    and target switching based on combat dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this threat
      manager will control. Must be a valid player instance that has been properly
      initialized as a bot character within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotThreatManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      BotThreatManager threatManager(myBot);

      // The threat manager is now initialized and ready to track bot''s combat threats'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a bot character. The bot parameter must point to a valid Player object that has
    been properly configured as a bot within the TrinityCore framework. The threat
    manager internally maintains references to the bot's combat state and target information,
    so it should not be instantiated before the bot is fully set up.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with a null or invalid player pointer. Passing
    an uninitialized or improperly configured Player object may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes during threat calculations. Ensure that the bot has been properly
    added to the world and initialized as a valid NPC before creating the threat manager.
