  class: ThreatReference
  method: ThreatReference
  signature: void ThreatReference::ThreatReference(const ThreatReference & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ThreatReference object as a copy of an existing ThreatReference.
  description: The ThreatReference constructor creates a new instance of the ThreatReference
    class by copying the state of an existing ThreatReference object. This copy constructor
    is typically used when creating new threat references that should mirror the properties
    and behavior of an existing reference, such as when managing mob aggro or threat
    lists in World of Warcraft's combat system. The method ensures that all internal
    data members are properly duplicated from the source object to maintain consistency
    in threat management logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing ThreatReference object to copy from. This parameter
      must be a valid ThreatReference instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'ThreatReference originalThreat(12345);

      ThreatReference newThreat(originalThreat); // Creates a copy of originalThreat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Threat Management Context
    code: 'Creature* target = ...;

      ThreatReference currentThreat(target->GetThreatManager().GetCurrentThreat());

      ThreatReference copiedThreat(currentThreat); // Used to maintain consistent
      threat state during combat processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the ThreatReference's internal
    data. Developers should be aware that if the ThreatReference contains pointers
    or references to external objects, those references will also be copied, potentially
    leading to shared resource access issues. The implementation assumes that the
    source object is in a valid state.
  warnings: Using this constructor with an uninitialized or invalid ThreatReference
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that param0 represents a properly constructed
    ThreatReference before calling this constructor.
