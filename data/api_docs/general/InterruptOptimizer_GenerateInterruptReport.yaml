  class: InterruptOptimizer
  method: GenerateInterruptReport
  signature: void InterruptOptimizer::GenerateInterruptReport(Player * requester)
documentation:
  brief: Generates and sends an interrupt report to the specified player, detailing
    interrupt-related performance metrics.
  description: The GenerateInterruptReport method constructs a comprehensive report
    on interrupt-related gameplay data for the given player. This includes information
    about successful interrupts, failed attempts, and performance statistics related
    to spell interruption mechanics. The report is formatted and sent directly to
    the requesting player's client. This method is typically invoked during player
    interactions with interruptible spells or when analyzing combat performance. The
    method assumes that the player object passed is valid and currently connected
    to the server.
  parameters:
  - name: requester
    description: Pointer to the Player object requesting the interrupt report. Must
      be a valid, connected player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptOptimizer optimizer;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      optimizer.GenerateInterruptReport(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Checking
    code: "InterruptOptimizer optimizer;\nif (player && player->IsInWorld()) {\n \
      \   optimizer.GenerateInterruptReport(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ player case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves performance-critical operations and should be
    called judiciously to avoid impacting server performance. The report generation
    may involve gathering data from multiple subsystems including combat logs, spell
    casting states, and interrupt mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure the requester parameter is a valid player object before calling
    this method. Passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method should not be called during critical server operations
    where performance is paramount.
