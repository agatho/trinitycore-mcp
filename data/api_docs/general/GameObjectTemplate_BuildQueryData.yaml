  class: GameObjectTemplate
  method: BuildQueryData
  signature: int GameObjectTemplate::BuildQueryData(LocaleConstant loc) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates query data for the game object template based on the specified
    locale.
  description: The BuildQueryData method prepares and initializes the internal query
    data structure for a GameObjectTemplate instance, using the provided locale to
    determine appropriate localized strings and settings. This method is typically
    invoked during the loading or initialization phase of game object templates, ensuring
    that all necessary data is correctly formatted and accessible for database queries
    and client interactions. The method handles translation and localization aspects
    by utilizing the specified LocaleConstant parameter, which determines how textual
    elements such as names and descriptions are retrieved or defaulted. It's an essential
    part of the template preparation pipeline in TrinityCore's GameObject system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the success status of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while non-zero
    values may indicate various error conditions such as invalid locale settings or
    data corruption during query construction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with default locale
    code: "GameObjectTemplate template;\nint result = template.BuildQueryData(DEFAULT_LOCALE);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Query data successfully built\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's core systems during
    server startup and map loading. It's important to note that the method may perform
    database operations or memory allocations, so calling it excessively in performance-critical
    sections should be avoided. The locale parameter affects how localized strings
    are handled, and incorrect locale values might lead to fallback behavior or data
    inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized GameObjectTemplate instance might
    result in undefined behavior or access violations. Ensure that the template has
    been properly initialized before invoking BuildQueryData. Additionally, since
    this method modifies internal state, it should not be called concurrently from
    multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
