documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the calendar event
  description: The GetEventId method returns the globally unique identifier (GUID)
    associated with a specific calendar event. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to uniquely identify and reference calendar events across the game
    world. The returned value is typically used for event lookups, comparisons, and
    maintaining event state in the database. Calendar events are created and managed
    through the game's calendar system, where each event is assigned a unique 64-bit
    identifier upon creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the calendar
    event. This value serves as the primary key for identifying the event within the
    calendar system and database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Event ID
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    uint64 eventId = event->GetEventId();\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"calendar\", \"\
      Event ID: %llu\", eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The event ID is assigned at event creation time and remains constant throughout
    the event's lifetime. This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a stored
    member variable without modifying any state.
