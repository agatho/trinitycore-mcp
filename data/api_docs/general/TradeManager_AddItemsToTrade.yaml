  brief: Adds items to the current trade session
  description: The AddItemsToTrade method is responsible for adding items to an ongoing
    trade between two players in World of Warcraft. This method typically gets called
    when a player drags an item into their trade window or selects items to offer
    during a trade negotiation. It validates that the items being added are valid
    for trading, checks inventory constraints, and updates the trade state accordingly.
    The method ensures that only items that can be traded (not bound, not soulbound,
    etc.) are added to the trade session.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the items were successfully added to the trade session,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid items, insufficient
    inventory space, or other trade restrictions being violated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Item Addition
    code: "TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetSession()->GetTradeData();\nif (tradeMgr)\n\
      {\n    bool success = tradeMgr->AddItemsToTrade(12345);\n    if (success)\n\
      \    {\n        // Item successfully added to trade\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Item added to trade successfully\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Failed\
      \ to add item to trade\n        sLog->outString(\"Failed to add item to trade\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when players
    interact with trade windows. It's important to note that this method works within
    the context of a specific player's trade session and may have different behavior
    depending on whether the trade is initiated by the player or another party.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper validation can lead to invalid
    trade states or game exploits. The method assumes that all necessary preconditions
    (like having an active trade session) are already met before being called.
