  class: PreservationEvoker
  method: PreservationEvoker
  signature: void PreservationEvoker::PreservationEvoker(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PreservationEvoker instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The PreservationEvoker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    PreservationEvoker class, associating it with a specific Player object that acts
    as the bot. This method sets up internal state and references necessary for the
    evoker's behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor typically
    performs initialization tasks such as setting up AI behavior, configuring spell
    usage, and establishing relationships with the player character. It is expected
    to be called during the creation or activation of an evoker bot in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the evoker bot that this
      instance will control. Must not be null and should represent a valid player
      character with evoker class specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of PreservationEvoker
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      PreservationEvoker evoker(myBot);

      // The evoker is now initialized and ready to use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs essential setup for the evoker AI, including
    initializing spell databases, behavior trees, or other internal structures. It
    should only be called once per instance during object construction.
