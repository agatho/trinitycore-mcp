api:
  class: SocialEvent
  method: GroupInvite
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::GroupInvite(int player, int inviter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new SocialEvent object representing a group invite
    action.
  description: The GroupInvite method constructs a SocialEvent instance that encapsulates
    the logic and data associated with a player being invited to join a group. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to handle social interactions
    between players, specifically for managing group invitations. The returned SocialEvent
    object can be used to track the invitation state, process acceptance or rejection,
    and manage related game mechanics such as loot distribution settings or group
    leader assignments. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    send the invite; it merely creates the event structure which can then be processed
    by the social system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is being invited to
      join a group. This value must correspond to an existing player in the game world.
  - name: inviter
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is extending the group
      invitation. This represents the player initiating the social action.
  returns: A SocialEvent object representing the group invitation event, which contains
    all necessary data and state information for processing the invite within the
    TrinityCore social system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Invite Creation
    code: 'SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::GroupInvite(12345, 67890);

      // This creates a group invite event where player 12345 is invited by player
      67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Group Invite Event
    code: "SocialEvent invite = SocialEvent::GroupInvite(playerGUID, inviterGUID);\n\
      if (invite.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the invitation through the social system\n\
      \    sSocialMgr->HandleGroupInvite(invite);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's social event handling system and
    should only be called when a group invitation needs to be initiated. The SocialEvent
    object returned can be further modified or passed to other systems for processing,
    such as sending network packets to clients or updating database records.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and inviter GUIDs are valid and correspond to
    existing players in the game world before calling this method. Invalid GUIDs may
    result in undefined behavior or failed invitation processing.
