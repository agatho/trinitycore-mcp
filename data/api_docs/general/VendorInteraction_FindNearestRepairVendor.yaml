  class: VendorInteraction
  method: FindNearestRepairVendor
  signature: uint32 VendorInteraction::FindNearestRepairVendor(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the entry ID of the nearest repair vendor for the specified
    player.
  description: The FindNearestRepairVendor method searches for the closest NPC in
    the player's current zone that is a repair vendor. It evaluates all available
    vendors within the player's proximity and returns the entry ID (likely a CreatureTemplate
    entry) of the one that is both a repair vendor and nearest to the player. This
    functionality is commonly used in game mechanics such as auto-repairing items
    or guiding players to nearby vendors. The method does not perform any direct interaction
    with the vendor; it simply identifies which vendor should be targeted. It assumes
    the player object is valid and has been initialized properly within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the entry ID of the nearest repair vendor
    creature. If no repair vendor is found within a reasonable range, it may return
    0 or an invalid entry ID depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 vendorEntry\
      \ = player->GetVendorInteraction()->FindNearestRepairVendor(player);\nif (vendorEntry\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interaction logic using vendorEntry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial queries or zone-based lookups to efficiently
    find nearby NPCs. It may cache results or use internal data structures for performance
    optimization in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure the player object is valid and initialized before calling this
    method, as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior. Also note that
    the returned entry ID must be verified against actual creature templates to avoid
    runtime errors when attempting to interact with the vendor.
