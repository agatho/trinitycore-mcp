  class: Creature
  method: HasSearchedAssistance
  signature: bool Creature::HasSearchedAssistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature has searched for assistance from other creatures.
  description: This method checks if a creature has already performed an assistance
    search during its AI behavior. It is typically used in the context of creature
    AI to prevent duplicate assistance searches or to manage the creature's behavior
    when it encounters combat. The method returns true if the creature has already
    searched for assistance, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for avoiding
    redundant AI actions and maintaining proper game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has searched for assistance, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature's AI has already attempted to find assistance
    from nearby creatures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->HasSearchedAssistance()) {\n    // Do something\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method is typically used in conjunction with
    other AI-related methods to manage creature behavior during combat. It should
    be called before attempting to search for assistance to avoid redundant actions.'
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other AI search methods; it specifically
    checks for whether the creature has already searched for assistance, not whether
    it is currently searching for assistance.
