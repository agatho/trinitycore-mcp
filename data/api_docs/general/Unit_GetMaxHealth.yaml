  class: Unit
  method: GetMaxHealth
  signature: uint64 Unit::GetMaxHealth() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum health value of the unit.
  description: The GetMaxHealth method retrieves the total health points that a Unit
    object can have, which is essential for calculating health percentages and determining
    the maximum amount of damage a unit can withstand. This value represents the base
    health of the unit before any modifiers or buffs are applied. The method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine how much health a creature or player has at
    any given time, and it's particularly important when dealing with dynamic health
    calculations or when comparing current vs. maximum health values.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum health value as a uint64, representing the total health
    points of the unit before any modifications are applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 maxHealth = unit->GetMaxHealth();

      uint64 currentHealth = unit->GetHealth();

      float healthPercentage = (float)currentHealth / (float)maxHealth * 100.0f;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Health Calculation Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nuint64 maxHealth = target->GetMaxHealth();\n\
      uint64 currentHealth = target->GetHealth();\nif (currentHealth > 0 && maxHealth\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    float healthPct = (float)currentHealth / (float)maxHealth * 100.0f;\n\
      \    // Use healthPct for UI display or combat calculations\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code sections, as it involves accessing internal data structures. The value returned
    by GetMaxHealth may vary depending on the unit type (player, creature, etc.) and
    can be affected by various buffs, debuffs, or temporary modifiers.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combat situations where health values
    are constantly changing; the returned value might not reflect current health status
    if modifiers have been applied. Also note that this method does not account for
    any temporary health changes or modifications.
