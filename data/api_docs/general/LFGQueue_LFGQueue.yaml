documentation:
  brief: Moves resources from another LFGQueue instance to this instance, effectively
    transferring ownership of its internal data structures.
  description: The LFGQueue move constructor transfers all resources owned by another
    LFGQueue object to this instance. This operation is performed efficiently without
    deep copying of data, making it a fast way to transfer queue state between objects.
    The source object becomes left in a valid but unspecified state after the move.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this constructor is used internally
    when managing LFG (Looking for Group) queues, particularly during object creation
    or reassignment scenarios where performance is critical. This method adheres to
    C++ move semantics and should only be called with an rvalue reference to ensure
    proper resource transfer.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'LFGQueue queue1;

      // ... populate queue1 ...

      LFGQueue queue2 = std::move(queue1); // Moves resources from queue1 to queue2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Function Context
    code: "LFGQueue createQueue() {\n    LFGQueue queue;\n    // ... initialize queue\
      \ ...\n    return queue; // Move semantics applied automatically\n}\n\nLFGQueue\
      \ mainQueue = createQueue(); // Queue is moved, not copied"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows standard C++ move semantics. After calling this
    constructor, the source object should not be used in any way that accesses its
    data members, as they may have been left in an undefined state. The implementation
    assumes that the source queue is in a valid state before the move operation.
  warnings: Using this constructor with an lvalue (non-temporary) will result in a
    compilation error if the compiler does not support implicit conversion to rvalue
    reference. Always use std::move() or similar mechanisms when explicitly moving
    objects.
