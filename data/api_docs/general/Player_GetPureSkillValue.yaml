  class: Player
  method: GetPureSkillValue
  signature: uint16 Player::GetPureSkillValue(uint32 skill) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the pure skill value for a specified skill without any modifiers
    or bonuses applied.
  description: The GetPureSkillValue method returns the base skill level of a player
    for a given skill, excluding any temporary bonuses, buffs, or modifiers that might
    affect the actual skill value. This method is useful for retrieving the original
    skill level before any game mechanics modifications have been applied. It's commonly
    used in scenarios where developers need to access the unmodified skill value for
    calculations or when implementing custom game systems that require base skill
    values.
  parameters:
  - name: skill
    description: The skill ID for which to retrieve the pure value. This parameter
      represents a specific skill type within the game, such as Alchemy, Enchanting,
      or First Aid.
  returns: Represents the base skill level of the specified skill before any modifiers
    are applied. Returns 0 if the skill is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint16 skillValue = player->GetPureSkillValue(129); // Retrieves the pure
      value for Enchanting skill
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Skill Check
    code: "uint16 pureSkillValue = player->GetPureSkillValue(171); // Retrieves the\
      \ pure value for First Aid\nif (pureSkillValue > 0)\n{\n    // Use pure skill\
      \ value for calculations\n    uint16 modifiedSkillValue = pureSkillValue + player->GetSkillModifier();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    to determine base skill values. It's important to note that the returned value
    may be zero if the skill is not properly initialized or recognized by the game
    system.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if the skill
    ID is invalid or not found in the player's skill list. Also, ensure that the skill
    parameter is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
