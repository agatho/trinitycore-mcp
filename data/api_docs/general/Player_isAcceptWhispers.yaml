  class: Player
  method: isAcceptWhispers
  signature: bool Player::isAcceptWhispers() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player accepts whispers from other players.
  description: The isAcceptWhispers method determines if a player has enabled the
    whispering feature in their settings, allowing other players to send them whispers.
    This method is part of the player's communication settings and affects how incoming
    whispers are handled. When this setting is enabled, the player will receive whispers
    from others; when disabled, whispers will be ignored. The method returns true
    if the player accepts whispers, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining player privacy and communication preferences within the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player accepts whispers, false if they do not accept
    whispers. This indicates whether the player's whisper settings are enabled or
    disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool acceptsWhispers = player->isAcceptWhispers();\nif (acceptsWhispers)\n\
      {\n    // Player will receive whispers\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player will ignore\
      \ whispers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player communication
    settings. The implementation relies on the player's internal settings which are
    updated when the player changes their whisper preferences through the UI or commands.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not check if the player is online or offline;
    it only checks the player's current whisper settings. If a player has disabled
    whispers, they will not receive any whispers regardless of their online status.
