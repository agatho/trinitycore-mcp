  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: CollectMapMetrics
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::CollectMapMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Collects and records resource usage metrics for all active maps in the World
    of Warcraft server.
  description: The CollectMapMetrics method gathers detailed performance and resource
    consumption data from all currently loaded maps within the TrinityCore server
    environment. This includes tracking memory usage, object counts, and other relevant
    metrics that help administrators monitor server health and identify potential
    performance bottlenecks. The collected data is typically used for diagnostic purposes,
    performance tuning, and generating reports on map-specific resource utilization.
    This method is usually invoked periodically by the server's monitoring system
    or manually during maintenance windows.

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Monitoring
    code: 'ResourceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.CollectMapMetrics();

      // Metrics are now collected and stored for analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause temporary performance overhead during execution as
    it iterates through all active maps. It's recommended to call this method during
    low-traffic periods or as part of a scheduled monitoring task. The collected metrics
    are typically stored internally and can be accessed via other methods in the ResourceMonitor
    class.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during high-traffic periods may impact
    server performance. Ensure that any automated calls to this method are properly
    throttled to avoid unnecessary resource contention.
