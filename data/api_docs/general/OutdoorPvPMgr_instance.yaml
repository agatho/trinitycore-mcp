documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the OutdoorPvPMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the OutdoorPvPMgr
    class, providing global access to the outdoor player versus player management
    system. This manager handles all outdoor PvP zones, their states, objectives,
    and player interactions within those zones. The method ensures that only one instance
    of OutdoorPvPMgr exists throughout the server's lifetime, making it accessible
    from any part of the codebase without requiring explicit instantiation. This is
    essential for maintaining consistent PvP zone states across the entire game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single global instance of OutdoorPvPMgr. The method never
    returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing OutdoorPvPMgr instance
    code: "OutdoorPvPMgr* pvpMgr = OutdoorPvPMgr::instance();\n// Use pvpMgr to access\
      \ outdoor PvP functionality\nif (pvpMgr)\n{\n    // Perform operations with\
      \ the PvP manager\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance in PvP zone handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player* player, uint32 zoneId)\n{\n    OutdoorPvPMgr*\
      \ pvpMgr = OutdoorPvPMgr::instance();\n    if (pvpMgr)\n    {\n        // Check\
      \ if zone supports outdoor PvP\n        if (pvpMgr->HasOutdoorPvPUpdate(zoneId))\n\
      \        {\n            // Process PvP zone entry logic\n            pvpMgr->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player,\
      \ zoneId);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The OutdoorPvPMgr
    instance is created during server initialization and destroyed at shutdown. It's
    thread-safe for read operations as it's designed to be accessed from multiple
    threads, though modifications should be synchronized. The singleton ensures consistent
    PvP state management across all zones.
  warnings: While this method provides convenient access to the global PvP manager,
    overuse of singletons can make code harder to test and maintain. Be cautious when
    injecting dependencies or mocking this instance in unit tests. Also, since it's
    a global singleton, avoid creating circular dependencies with other global managers.
