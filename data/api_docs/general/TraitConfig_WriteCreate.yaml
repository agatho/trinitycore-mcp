  signature: void TraitConfig::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes trait configuration creation data to a ByteBuffer for player-related
    operations.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes trait configuration data into a ByteBuffer,
    typically used when sending trait-related information to players in the game world.
    This method is part of the TraitConfig class and handles the serialization process
    for creating or initializing trait configurations. It takes two player references
    - one for the owner and one for the receiver - which may be used to determine
    appropriate data filtering or permissions during serialization. The method does
    not return any value but modifies the provided ByteBuffer with serialized trait
    configuration data.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized trait configuration
      data will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the trait
      configuration. May be used for permission checks or data filtering.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the trait configuration
      data. Used to determine appropriate serialization format or visibility.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get player pointer

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get player pointer

      TraitConfig config;

      config.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during network packet construction for trait-related
    updates. The ByteBuffer should be properly initialized before calling this method.
    Implementation may vary based on specific trait types and player permissions.
