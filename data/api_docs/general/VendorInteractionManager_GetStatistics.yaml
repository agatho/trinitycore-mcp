  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & VendorInteractionManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the vendor interaction statistics for the current session.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics structure that holds aggregated data about vendor interactions. This
    includes information such as the number of items sold, total gold earned, and
    other relevant metrics during the current session or player's interaction with
    vendors. The returned structure is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    This method is typically used for tracking player behavior, generating reports,
    or implementing game mechanics that depend on vendor transaction history.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing aggregated vendor
    interaction data including counts, monetary values, and timing information related
    to transactions with vendors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const auto& stats = vendorManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 itemsSold = stats.items_sold;

      uint64 totalGoldEarned = stats.total_gold_earned;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Vendor Statistics
    code: "void DisplayVendorStats(VendorInteractionManager& manager) {\n    const\
      \ auto& stats = manager.GetStatistics();\n    std::cout << \"Items Sold: \"\
      \ << stats.items_sold << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Total Gold Earned: \"\
      \ << stats.total_gold_earned << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Transactions:\
      \ \" << stats.transaction_count << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the current state and may
    be updated by other methods in the class. This method does not perform any locking
    or synchronization internally, so if thread safety is required, external synchronization
    must be implemented by the caller.
  warnings: Modifying the returned Statistics reference directly will result in undefined
    behavior as it's a const reference to internal data. Always treat this return
    value as read-only for proper operation of the vendor interaction system.
