  method: GetRageCostCache
  signature: int & ResourceCalculator::GetRageCostCache()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the cached rage cost value used for calculating warrior
    ability resource requirements.
  description: The GetRageCostCache method provides access to a precomputed rage cost
    value that is typically used in warrior class ability calculations within the
    TrinityCore framework. This cached value represents the amount of rage required
    for specific warrior abilities or actions, and is updated based on character state,
    equipment, and other relevant factors. The method returns a reference to an integer
    value, allowing direct modification of the cached rage cost if needed. This caching
    mechanism improves performance by avoiding repeated calculations of the same rage
    cost values during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the cached rage cost value for warrior
    abilities. The returned value can be modified directly, which will update the
    cached rage cost used in subsequent ability calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and modifying cached rage cost
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      int& rageCost = calculator.GetRageCostCache();

      rageCost = 10; // Modify the cached value directly

      int currentCost = calculator.GetRageCostCache(); // Retrieve updated value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal cached value, so modifications
    to the returned reference will affect all subsequent uses of this cached rage
    cost. The cache is typically invalidated and recalculated when character state
    changes significantly (e.g., weapon swaps, buff/debuff updates).
  warnings: Since this method returns a direct reference to an internal cached value,
    modifying it directly can have unintended side effects on other systems that rely
    on the cached rage cost. Always ensure proper synchronization if used in multithreaded
    contexts.
