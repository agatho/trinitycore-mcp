  signature: void Player::UpdateExpertise(int attType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's expertise rating for the specified attack type
  description: The UpdateExpertise method recalculates and applies the player's expertise
    rating based on their current equipment, talents, and buffs for a specific attack
    type. This method is typically called when there are changes to the player's combat
    abilities that affect their expertise, such as weapon swaps, talent point changes,
    or buff expiration. The expertise rating reduces the chance for enemies to dodge
    attacks from the player. This method updates internal player statistics and may
    trigger UI refreshes to reflect the new expertise values.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: The attack type to update expertise for. Valid values are 0 for melee,
      1 for ranged, and 2 for spell attacks. This parameter determines which expertise
      rating is recalculated and applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update melee expertise
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateExpertise(0); // Update melee expertise'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update all expertise types after talent change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateExpertise(0); // Melee

      player->UpdateExpertise(1); // Ranged

      player->UpdateExpertise(2); // Spell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls other related functions to recalculate expertise
    values based on player's current state. It may trigger visual updates in the UI
    to reflect new expertise levels. The method does not directly modify database
    values but updates in-memory player statistics.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid attType values (not 0, 1, or 2) may result
    in undefined behavior. This method should not be called during combat without
    proper synchronization as it may cause temporary UI inconsistencies.
