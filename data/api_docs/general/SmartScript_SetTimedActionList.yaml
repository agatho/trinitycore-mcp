  class: SmartScript
  method: SetTimedActionList
  signature: void SmartScript::SetTimedActionList(SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 entry,
    Unit * invoker, uint32 startFromEventId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and assigns a timed action list to a SmartScript instance for
    execution.
  description: The SetTimedActionList method prepares a SmartScriptHolder object for
    timed event processing by associating it with a specific entry ID, invoker unit,
    and starting event ID. This function is typically used within the context of AI
    scripting in TrinityCore to manage sequences of actions that should occur after
    a specified delay. The method configures internal state variables necessary for
    the smart script engine to properly execute timed actions based on the provided
    parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing the action list
      and associated data for timed execution.
  - name: entry
    description: Unique identifier for the script entry that defines which actions
      should be executed in sequence.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that triggered or is invoking this timed
      action list, used for context and target identification.
  - name: startFromEventId
    description: The event ID from which execution should begin within the action
      list, allowing partial execution starting at a specific point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetTimedActionList
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder holder;

      Unit* target = player;

      uint32 entryId = 12345;

      uint32 eventId = 0;

      smartScript.SetTimedActionList(holder, entryId, target, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state of the SmartScript instance and should
    only be called when the script is in a valid initialization phase. It does not
    directly execute actions but prepares the environment for future timed execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided SmartScriptHolder object is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized data may lead to undefined
    behavior during execution.
