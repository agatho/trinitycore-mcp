documentation:
  brief: Minimizes travel distance for quest turn-ins by optimizing the bot's path
    to quest givers.
  description: The MinimizeTurnInTravel method is designed to reduce the amount of
    travel required for a player bot to complete quest turn-ins. It analyzes available
    quest givers and optimizes the bot's movement path to minimize overall travel
    distance, typically used in automated questing scripts or AI-driven bots. This
    method modifies the bot's behavior to prioritize efficiency when completing quests,
    especially useful in scenarios where travel time significantly impacts quest completion
    speed. The optimization considers both current location and potential future quest
    availability to determine the most efficient route.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      its quest turn-in travel minimized. Must be a valid player instance with active
      questing capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.MinimizeTurnInTravel(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Questing AI Loop
    code: "void BotQuestingAI::ProcessQuests()\n{\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n \
      \   if (bot && bot->HasActiveQuests())\n    {\n        QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;\n\
      \        questTurnIn.MinimizeTurnInTravel(bot);\n        // Continue with quest\
      \ completion logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal pathfinding or quest routing logic within
    the bot's AI system. It may cache optimized paths for subsequent quest completions,
    potentially improving performance over multiple quest cycles. The optimization
    algorithm might consider factors such as quest dependencies, quest giver locations,
    and travel costs between different zones.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. This method may alter the bot's movement
    patterns significantly, which could interfere with other AI systems if not properly
    coordinated. The optimization might not account for dynamic quest availability
    or temporary zone restrictions.
