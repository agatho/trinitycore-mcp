  method: Initialize
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the LFGGroupCoordinator instance, setting up internal data structures
    and state for group finding functionality.
  description: The Initialize method prepares an LFGGroupCoordinator object for use
    by setting up internal data structures, initializing member variables, and configuring
    the coordinator's state for managing group finding activities. This method is
    typically called during the creation or activation of a group finder coordinator
    instance. It ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and that the coordinator
    is in a valid state to handle LFG-related operations such as player matchmaking,
    group formation, and quest assignment. The initialization process may involve
    setting default values for various configuration parameters, establishing internal
    tracking mechanisms, and preparing data containers needed for coordinating group
    activities.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an LFGGroupCoordinator
    instance. Re-initializing an already initialized coordinator may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically invoked internally by the
    TrinityCore framework when a new group finder coordinator is created, but can
    also be manually called in specific scenarios where manual control over initialization
    timing is required.
  warnings: Calling Initialize on an already initialized coordinator instance may
    result in memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that this method
    is only called once per object lifetime. Do not call this method from multiple
    threads simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms.
