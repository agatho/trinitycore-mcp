  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: RecordCreation
  signature: void BotSessionFactory::RecordCreation(uint64 durationMicroseconds, bool
    success)
documentation:
  brief: Records the duration and success status of a bot creation operation.
  description: The RecordCreation method logs timing information and outcome details
    for bot creation processes within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    invoked after attempting to create a new bot character, capturing how long the
    process took and whether it completed successfully. The recorded data may be used
    for performance monitoring, debugging, or statistical analysis of bot spawning
    behavior in World of Warcraft environments. It does not directly affect gameplay
    mechanics but serves as an internal tracking mechanism for administrative and
    development purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMicroseconds
    description: The time taken to complete the bot creation process, measured in
      microseconds. This value represents the elapsed time from start to finish of
      the operation.
  - name: success
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the bot creation was successful
      (true) or failed (false). This determines how the operation is logged and potentially
      analyzed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 creationTime = 150000; // 150 milliseconds

      bool wasSuccessful = true;

      botSessionFactory->RecordCreation(creationTime, wasSuccessful);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Timing Measurement
    code: '#include <chrono>

      auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... bot creation logic here ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      botSessionFactory->RecordCreation(duration, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely stores data in internal logs or metrics systems for later
    analysis. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, ensuring minimal impact
    on performance during bot creation operations.
