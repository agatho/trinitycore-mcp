  class: PathGenerator
  method: GetPathLength
  signature: float PathGenerator::GetPathLength() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total length of the generated path in world units.
  description: The GetPathLength method computes the cumulative distance of all waypoints
    in the path generated by the PathGenerator. This value represents the total travel
    distance from the starting point to the destination along the calculated route.
    The method is typically used for pathfinding calculations, movement duration estimation,
    or determining the cost of navigation. It assumes that the path has already been
    generated and populated with valid waypoints. The returned value is expressed
    in world units (typically yards or meters depending on the game's coordinate system).
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the total length of the path in world units.
    Returns 0.0 if no path has been generated or if the path contains fewer than two
    waypoints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Get Path Length
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has been initialized and path is generated

      float length = pathGen.GetPathLength();

      printf("Path length: %.2f units\n", length);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Path Length for Movement Calculation
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.CalculatePath(startPos, endPos);

      float pathLength = pathGen.GetPathLength();

      float moveSpeed = unit->GetSpeed(MOVE_RUN);

      float movementTime = pathLength / moveSpeed;

      // Use movementTime for AI decision making or animation timing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple summation of distances between consecutive
    waypoints. It does not account for terrain height differences or complex pathing
    such as obstacle avoidance beyond the initial path generation. The accuracy depends
    on the precision of the original path generation process and the number of waypoints
    in the path.
  warnings: Ensure that the path has been properly generated before calling this method,
    otherwise the result may be incorrect or misleading. This method does not validate
    the path data for consistency; invalid paths could lead to unexpected results.
