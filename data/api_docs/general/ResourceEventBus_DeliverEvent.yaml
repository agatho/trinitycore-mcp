  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: bool ResourceEventBus::DeliverEvent(BotAI * subscriber, const ResourceEvent
    & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a resource event to a specified bot AI subscriber.
  description: The DeliverEvent method is responsible for routing and dispatching
    resource-related events to subscribed BotAI instances within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that when a resource event occurs, such as a quest update
    or item acquisition, the appropriate AI components are notified and can respond
    accordingly. The method takes a pointer to a BotAI subscriber and the event data
    to be delivered. It returns true if the event was successfully delivered to the
    subscriber, and false otherwise. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    between game events and AI behavior in bot-based systems.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive the resource event.
      Must not be null for successful delivery.
  - name: event
    description: The ResourceEvent object containing the data and context of the event
      being delivered. This includes information about the type of resource event
      and associated metadata.
  returns: True if the event was successfully delivered to the subscriber; false if
    delivery failed, which may occur due to invalid subscriber pointer or other internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nResourceEvent event;\nevent.type = ResourceEventType::QUEST_UPDATE;\n\
      event.data = \"Quest completed\";\nbool success = bus.DeliverEvent(bot, event);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Event delivered successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Delivery with Error Handling
    code: "BotAI* bot = GetBot();\nif (!bot) {\n    return false;\n}\nResourceEvent\
      \ event;\nevent.type = ResourceEventType::ITEM_ACQUIRED;\nevent.data = \"Gold\
      \ Coin\";\nbool delivered = bus.DeliverEvent(bot, event);\nif (!delivered) {\n\
      \    // Log error or retry logic\n    LOG_ERROR(\"AI\", \"Failed to deliver\
      \ resource event to bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a publish-subscribe pattern used in TrinityCore's
    AI system. It assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly initialized and
    registered with the event bus. The event delivery mechanism may involve internal
    queuing or threading considerations depending on how the ResourceEventBus is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the subscriber pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be
    aware that asynchronous delivery might not guarantee immediate processing of events.
