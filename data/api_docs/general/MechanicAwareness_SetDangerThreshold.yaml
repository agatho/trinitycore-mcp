  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: SetDangerThreshold
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::SetDangerThreshold(float threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the danger threshold value for mechanic awareness detection.
  description: The SetDangerThreshold method configures the float value that determines
    the level of danger at which a mechanized entity will trigger its awareness behavior.
    This threshold is used within the context of AI-driven detection systems to evaluate
    environmental hazards or threats. The method does not return any value and directly
    modifies an internal state variable. It is typically invoked during initialization
    or configuration phases of an AI module, and affects how the MechanicAwareness
    class responds to various in-game events such as proximity to dangerous objects
    or hostile actions.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: A floating-point value representing the danger level threshold. Values
      above this threshold will trigger awareness behaviors in the mechanized entity.
      Valid range depends on game mechanics but generally should be non-negative.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      awareness.SetDangerThreshold(50.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
    code: 'float dangerLevel = 75.5f;

      MechanicAwareness* mechAwareness = player->GetMechanicAwareness();

      mechAwareness->SetDangerThreshold(dangerLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should be called before the MechanicAwareness
    object is actively used in gameplay. The threshold value may influence performance
    if set too frequently or with extreme values.
  warnings: Setting a very low threshold might cause excessive triggering of awareness
    behaviors, leading to performance degradation. Ensure that the threshold aligns
    with expected game mechanics and difficulty settings.
