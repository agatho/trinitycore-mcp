documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another ChannelMgr instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources and state from
    the right-hand ChannelMgr object to this object. This operation is typically used
    to efficiently transfer ownership of channel-related data structures without performing
    deep copies. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the move. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method
    supports efficient management of channel memberships and associated data during
    object lifecycle operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to this ChannelMgr instance, allowing for chaining of assignment
    operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'ChannelMgr manager1;

      ChannelMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor

      // or

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Move assignment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    be used when transferring ownership of ChannelMgr resources. After a successful
    move, the source object should not be used in any way that would access its former
    state.
