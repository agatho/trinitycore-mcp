  class: Unit
  method: CannotTurn
  signature: bool Unit::CannotTurn() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit cannot turn, returning true if the unit is unable
    to turn.
  description: The CannotTurn method checks if a Unit object is currently unable to
    perform turning actions. This typically occurs when the unit is in a state where
    movement or orientation changes are prohibited, such as during certain spell effects,
    combat situations, or specific game mechanics that prevent turning. The method
    returns true when the unit's turning capability is disabled, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for managing unit behavior during gameplay events
    and ensuring proper handling of movement restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit cannot turn, indicating that the unit is currently
    unable to perform turning actions; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->CannotTurn()) {\n    // Handle unit that cannot turn\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related logic
    to determine if a unit can change orientation or perform turning actions. Implementation
    may depend on specific game state conditions such as being in combat or under
    certain spell effects.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as it may not always reflect
    the actual physical ability of a unit to turn, but rather its current state in
    terms of movement restrictions.
