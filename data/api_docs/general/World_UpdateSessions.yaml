  signature: void World::UpdateSessions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active client sessions with the specified time difference
  description: The UpdateSessions method processes and updates all currently active
    player sessions in the world. It handles session timeouts, packet processing,
    and maintains connection integrity for all connected clients. This method is typically
    called during the main game loop to ensure that all player connections are properly
    maintained and that any pending operations are executed. The method uses the provided
    time difference (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since the
    last update cycle, which is crucial for maintaining accurate session timing and
    handling time-sensitive operations.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last session update.
      This value is used to calculate timeouts, process queued packets, and maintain
      accurate session timing across all connected players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... other processing\n\
      \    sWorld->UpdateSessions(diff);\n    // ... more processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with main update cycle
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update world objects, AI, etc.\n\
      \    UpdateObjects(diff);\n    \n    // Update all active sessions\n    UpdateSessions(diff);\n\
      \    \n    // Handle pending operations\n    HandlePendingOperations();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main game loop and should not be invoked directly
    by other systems. The diff parameter must represent actual elapsed time since
    last call to ensure proper session management. Session updates may involve network
    I/O operations and should be considered when optimizing performance.
  warnings: Do not call this method with incorrect timing values as it may cause session
    timeouts or connection issues. This method modifies active sessions and should
    only be called from the main thread in single-threaded environments.
