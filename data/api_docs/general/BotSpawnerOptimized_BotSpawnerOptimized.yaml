  method: BotSpawnerOptimized
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::BotSpawnerOptimized(const BotSpawnerOptimized
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotSpawnerOptimized class with values copied
    from an existing instance.
  description: The BotSpawnerOptimized constructor is responsible for creating a new
    instance of the BotSpawnerOptimized class by copying the state and configuration
    from another existing BotSpawnerOptimized object. This copy constructor ensures
    that all internal data members, including bot spawning parameters, timers, and
    configuration settings, are properly duplicated to maintain consistent behavior
    between instances. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server environment,
    this method supports the creation of bot spawner configurations that can be reused
    or modified without affecting the original instance. The constructor performs
    deep copying of relevant data structures to prevent unintended side effects when
    multiple bot spawners are managing different sets of bots.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing BotSpawnerOptimized object whose state will be copied
      to initialize this new instance. This parameter must be a valid, initialized
      object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Constructor Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized originalSpawner;

      // Configure originalSpawner...

      BotSpawnerOptimized newSpawner(originalSpawner); // Creates a copy of the original
      spawner'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Spawner Instances
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized baseSpawner;

      // Configure baseSpawner with specific bot parameters...

      BotSpawnerOptimized spawner1(baseSpawner);

      BotSpawnerOptimized spawner2(baseSpawner);

      // Both spawners can now be independently configured and used'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the object's data members. If
    any member variables contain pointers to dynamically allocated memory, care must
    be taken to ensure proper deep copying or reference counting is implemented elsewhere
    in the class. The implementation should ensure thread safety if multiple threads
    access or modify spawner instances concurrently.
  warnings: Using this constructor with an uninitialized or corrupted BotSpawnerOptimized
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the source object (param0)
    is properly initialized before calling this constructor. Avoid copying large data
    structures unnecessarily as it may impact performance in high-frequency spawning
    scenarios.
