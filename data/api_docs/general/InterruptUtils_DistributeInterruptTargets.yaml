documentation:
  brief: Distributes interrupt targets among group members based on specified parameters
  description: The DistributeInterruptTargets method handles the logic for allocating
    interruptible actions or effects across group members in a World of Warcraft environment.
    This utility function is typically used during spell casting or ability usage
    where multiple targets need to be processed in a distributed manner, often related
    to interrupt mechanics such as dispelling or breaking crowd control effects. The
    method takes into account the number of targets and group composition to determine
    how interrupts should be distributed among players or NPCs within the group context.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: The total number of interrupt targets that need to be processed.
      This represents the count of entities that can potentially be interrupted by
      the current action.
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier or index that determines which group members
      will receive the interrupt distribution. This value typically corresponds to
      a specific player group or raid instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Distribution
    code: InterruptUtils::DistributeInterruptTargets(5, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Distributing Interrupts Across a Raid Group
    code: InterruptUtils::DistributeInterruptTargets(10, 2);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems and may
    involve synchronization across threads when processing interrupt events. It's
    designed to maintain fairness in target distribution among group members during
    interrupt mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the targets parameter is non-negative and that the group identifier
    corresponds to an active group within the game world to prevent undefined behavior
    or crashes.
