  brief: Casts the Temporal Anomaly spell for the Evoker AI.
  description: The CastTemporalAnomaly method is responsible for executing the Temporal
    Anomaly spell within the context of an Evoker's AI behavior. This method likely
    selects a suitable target, checks for valid casting conditions, and triggers the
    spell cast animation and effects. The implementation would typically involve verifying
    that the spell is not on cooldown, the caster has sufficient mana or resources,
    and that the target is within range and valid for the spell. In the context of
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this method integrates with the AI
    system to provide intelligent spell casting behavior for Evoker NPCs.

  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI Context
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_CastTimer <= diff)\n\
      \    {\n        CastTemporalAnomaly();\n        m_CastTimer = 5000; // Reset\
      \ timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_CastTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI state machine and may be called
    from within UpdateAI() or other event-driven functions. The actual spell targeting
    and casting logic would depend on the specific implementation details of the Evoker
    class and its inheritance hierarchy.
