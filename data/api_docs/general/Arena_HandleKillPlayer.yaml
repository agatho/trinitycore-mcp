  class: Arena
  method: HandleKillPlayer
  signature: void Arena::HandleKillPlayer(Player * player, Player * killer)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player is killed in an arena match, updating statistics
    and managing rewards.
  description: The HandleKillPlayer method is responsible for processing the death
    of a player within an arena environment. When a player dies during an arena match,
    this function is invoked to manage various game mechanics including updating player
    statistics, awarding or deducting honor points, handling arena team rankings,
    and potentially triggering end-of-match logic. The method takes both the killed
    player and the killer as parameters to accurately process the outcome of the kill
    within the context of competitive play. This function ensures that arena rules
    are properly enforced and that players receive appropriate rewards or penalties
    based on their performance.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who was killed in the arena match. This
      parameter represents the victim whose death is being processed.
  - name: killer
    description: Pointer to the Player object who killed the victim. This parameter
      represents the aggressor responsible for the player's death.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat handler
    code: "void Arena::HandleKillPlayer(Player* player, Player* killer)\n{\n    //\
      \ Update player statistics\n    player->UpdateArenaStats(killer);\n    \n  \
      \  // Award honor to killer\n    killer->RewardHonor(player, 1);\n    \n   \
      \ // Check if match should end\n    if (IsMatchOver())\n        EndArenaMatch();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the arena combat system and may
    be invoked during both normal gameplay and special arena events. Developers should
    ensure that player state is properly validated before calling this function to
    avoid unexpected behavior. The method assumes that both player and killer pointers
    are valid and that the players are indeed participating in an active arena match.
  warnings: Improper handling of player pointers can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that both player and killer objects are valid and currently in
    an arena before calling this method. This function should not be called outside
    of proper arena match contexts as it may cause incorrect stat updates or reward
    distribution.
