  signature: void WorldSession::HandleRequestWorldQuestUpdate(WorldPackets::Quest::RequestWorldQuestUpdate
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the client with current world quest data for the player's active
    quests.
  description: The HandleRequestWorldQuestUpdate method processes incoming requests
    from the client to refresh and synchronize world quest information. This method
    is typically invoked when a player opens their quest log or when world quests
    need to be refreshed due to changes in availability, progress, or rewards. It
    ensures that the client displays accurate and up-to-date quest data including
    quest objectives, timers, and reward information. The method handles packet processing
    for world quest updates and sends relevant data back to the connected player's
    client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestWorldQuestUpdate(WorldPackets::Quest::RequestWorldQuestUpdate&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the request to update world quests\n    SendWorldQuestUpdate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and should
    only be called as a result of a client-initiated packet. The method assumes that
    the session has an active player with valid quest data. Performance considerations
    include avoiding excessive packet sending during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper packet validation, as
    it may cause synchronization issues between client and server. Ensure that world
    quest data is properly initialized before calling this method.
