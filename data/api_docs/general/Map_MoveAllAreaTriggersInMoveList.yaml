documentation:
  brief: Moves all area triggers in the map's move list to their new positions.
  description: The MoveAllAreaTriggersInMoveList method processes and applies position
    updates for all area triggers that are queued for movement within the map. This
    method is typically invoked during the map update cycle to ensure that area trigger
    positions are synchronized with their associated game objects or entities. It
    handles the logic of moving triggers from their old locations to new ones, potentially
    triggering enter/leave events for players in those areas. The method operates
    on a list of triggers that have been marked for movement, ensuring proper spatial
    awareness and event handling within the game world.

  - title: Basic usage during map update
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   MoveAllAreaTriggersInMoveList();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map update mechanism and should not typically
    be called directly by external code. It's designed to work in conjunction with
    other movement and trigger systems within TrinityCore's core architecture.
