  class: MountManager
  method: MountPlayer
  signature: bool MountManager::MountPlayer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Mounts the specified player on their current mount if available.
  description: The MountPlayer method attempts to mount a player using their currently
    selected or available mount. This method is typically used in game server logic
    to apply mount effects to players, such as when they enter certain zones, complete
    quests, or use specific spells. The method checks for valid player state and mount
    availability before attempting to apply the mount effect. It returns true if the
    mounting was successful, false otherwise. The implementation likely interacts
    with the player's movement and animation systems to visually represent the mounted
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or internal index within the game system. This parameter is expected to reference
      a valid player entity in the server's memory.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully mounted, false if mounting
    failed due to invalid player state, missing mount, or other conditions preventing
    the mount operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Player Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool success = mountManager.MountPlayer(&playerId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Player is now mounted\n    printf(\"Player mounted successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to mount player\n    printf(\"Failed to mount\
      \ player\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the player to be in a valid state (not dead,
    not in combat, etc.) for mounting to succeed. It may also depend on the player
    having access to a valid mount through their character progression or inventory.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    entity before calling this method. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes.
