  class: Creature
  method: GetLootMode
  signature: uint16 Creature::GetLootMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot mode setting for the creature, determining how loot is distributed
    among players.
  description: This method retrieves the current loot mode value set for a creature,
    which controls how loot is distributed in a group or raid context. The loot mode
    affects whether loot is distributed using classic, loot, or loot mode settings,
    and can influence the distribution of items such as equipment or currency. It
    is commonly used to determine the specific loot rules applied to a creature's
    loot table during the loot process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the current loot mode setting for the
    creature. The value typically corresponds to different loot modes such as 1 (default),
    2 (loot mode), or 3 (loot mode) depending on the game mechanics and configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 lootMode = creature->GetLootMode();\nif (lootMode == 1)\n{\n   \
      \ // Default loot mode\n    // Handle loot distribution accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the creature's loot table
    and may be affected by group settings or raid configurations. The value returned
    can influence how items are distributed among players in a group.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return different values depending on the
    creature's current loot mode setting, which could affect loot distribution behavior
    in group scenarios.
