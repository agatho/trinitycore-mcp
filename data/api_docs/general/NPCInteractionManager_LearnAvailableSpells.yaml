  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: LearnAvailableSpells
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::LearnAvailableSpells(Creature * trainer)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach all available spells to the player from the specified NPC
    trainer.
  description: The LearnAvailableSpells method iterates through the spells available
    for training by the given NPC trainer and attempts to add them to the player's
    spell book. This function is typically invoked when a player interacts with a
    trainer NPC to learn new spells. It checks if the player meets the prerequisites
    for each spell, such as required skill levels or quest completions, and only teaches
    spells that are eligible. The method returns true if at least one spell was successfully
    learned, and false otherwise. This functionality is integral to the character
    progression system in World of Warcraft, allowing players to expand their abilities
    through NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: trainer
    description: A pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC trainer from
      which spells are to be learned. Must not be null.
  returns: True if at least one spell was successfully taught to the player, false
    if no spells were learned or if the trainer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an NPC interaction handler
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->LearnAvailableSpells(trainer))\
      \ {\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have learned new spells.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    player->SendNotification(\"No new spells to learn.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal spell learning logic of TrinityCore, which
    includes checking prerequisites like skill levels, quest requirements, and class
    restrictions. It is typically called during player-NPC interaction events such
    as when a player opens a trainer's dialog.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'trainer' parameter points to a valid Creature object
    that represents an actual trainer NPC; otherwise, the method will return false
    without any error messages. Also, calling this method outside of proper NPC interaction
    contexts may lead to unexpected behavior or incomplete spell learning.
