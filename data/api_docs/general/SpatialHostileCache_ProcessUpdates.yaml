  method: ProcessUpdates
  signature: void SpatialHostileCache::ProcessUpdates(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spatial hostile cache with new data based on the time delta.
  description: The ProcessUpdates method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the internal state of the SpatialHostileCache class. It processes any pending
    updates or changes to the cache's data, typically triggered by game ticks or time-based
    events. This method ensures that the cache reflects the current state of hostile
    entities within a given spatial area, which is essential for AI behavior, threat
    management, and combat-related systems in TrinityCore. The method uses the provided
    time delta (diff) to determine how much time has passed since the last update
    and adjusts internal tracking accordingly.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all spatial hostile\
      \ caches\n    for (auto& cache : m_spatialHostileCaches)\n    {\n        cache.ProcessUpdates(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game loop or update
    system. It's designed to be efficient and should not block other systems. The
    internal implementation likely handles caching invalidation, entity tracking updates,
    and spatial queries.
