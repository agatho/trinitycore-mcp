  signature: time_t Map::GetGORespawnTime(int spawnId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of a game object for a given spawn ID.
  description: The GetGORespawnTime method retrieves the respawn time of a specific
    game object based on its spawn ID. This method is used to determine when a game
    object will respawn in the world, which is crucial for managing dynamic content
    and ensuring proper game mechanics. The method operates on the map's internal
    data structures and provides information about the game object's respawn behavior.
    It typically returns a time value representing the next respawn time of the specified
    game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the next respawn time of the game object
    identified by the spawn ID. If no respawn time is available or the spawn ID is
    invalid, it may return zero or a negative value indicating no respawn time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = map->GetGORespawnTime(12345);\nif (respawnTime > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Game object will respawn at the specified time\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Respawn time: \";\n}\nelse {\n    // No respawn time available\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No respawn time available\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to manage game object states and respawn times. Performance considerations include
    checking if the spawn ID exists before calling this method, as invalid IDs may
    cause undefined behavior or return zero values.
  warnings: This method should not be called on invalid spawn IDs as it may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect time values. The returned time value represents
    absolute time in seconds since epoch, so developers must ensure proper conversion
    when using it for display purposes.
