  brief: Handles the reordering of characters in a player's character list
  description: The HandleReorderCharacters method processes a packet sent by the client
    when a player requests to reorder their characters within the character selection
    screen. This method updates the internal ordering of characters for the session's
    active account, ensuring that the character list reflects the new arrangement
    specified by the client. The method typically validates the requested order and
    persists the changes to the database. It is part of the character management system
    in TrinityCore and directly affects how characters appear in the UI.
  parameters:
  - name: reorderChars
    description: A packet containing the new ordering information for the player's
      characters, including the character GUIDs and their intended sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleReorderCharacters
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleReorderCharacters(WorldPackets::Character::ReorderCharacters&\
      \ reorderChars)\n{\n    // Process character reordering logic here\n    // Validate\
      \ and apply new order to the player's character list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during character selection when a user drags
    and drops characters to change their display order. The implementation should
    ensure that all character GUIDs in the packet are valid and belong to the current
    session's account.
  warnings: Improper handling of character ordering can lead to inconsistencies in
    the UI or database corruption if invalid GUIDs are accepted. Ensure proper validation
    before applying changes.
