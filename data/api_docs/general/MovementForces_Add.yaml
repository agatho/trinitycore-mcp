  class: MovementForces
  method: Add
  signature: bool MovementForces::Add(const MovementForce & newForce)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new movement force to the collection and returns true if successful.
  description: The Add method inserts a new MovementForce object into the internal
    collection of movement forces. It validates the input force and ensures it can
    be properly integrated into the existing force system. This method is typically
    used during character or object movement calculations where additional forces
    (such as gravity, wind, or applied impulses) need to be considered. The method
    returns true if the force was successfully added, and false if the addition failed
    due to validation errors or system constraints. This operation may affect how
    movement calculations are performed for the associated unit or object.
  parameters:
  - name: newForce
    description: The MovementForce object to be added to the collection. Must contain
      valid force parameters including magnitude, direction, and type of force.
  returns: True if the movement force was successfully added to the collection; false
    otherwise. Returns false if the input force is invalid or if the system cannot
    accommodate additional forces.
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Basic Movement Force
    code: "MovementForce force;\nforce.magnitude = 10.0f;\nforce.direction = {0.0f,\
      \ 1.0f, 0.0f};\nforce.type = MovementForceType::PUSH;\nbool success = movementForces.Add(force);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Force was added successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a Force with Error Handling
    code: "MovementForce force;\nforce.magnitude = 0.0f; // Invalid magnitude\nforce.direction\
      \ = {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\nforce.type = MovementForceType::PULL;\nbool success\
      \ = movementForces.Add(force);\nif (!success)\n{\n    // Handle the case where\
      \ force addition failed\n    // Log error or notify system\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform internal validation of the MovementForce object before
    adding it. It's important to ensure that all fields of the MovementForce are properly
    initialized before calling Add. The collection may have a maximum capacity, which
    could cause the method to return false if the limit is reached.
  warnings: Do not call this method with an invalid or uninitialized MovementForce
    object as it may lead to undefined behavior or failed additions. Ensure that force
    parameters like magnitude and direction are within acceptable ranges for your
    game's physics system.
