  method: SetData
  signature: void ZoneScript::SetData(uint32 param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Sets data values for a zone script, typically used to track quest progress
    or state changes within a specific zone.
  description: The SetData method is a virtual function in the ZoneScript class that
    allows scripts to store and update integer-based data associated with a specific
    zone. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to manage
    quest states, event triggers, or other zone-specific variables. It accepts two
    uint32 parameters which can represent various identifiers or state values depending
    on the implementation context. The method does not return any value and is typically
    called by game systems when certain events occur within a zone, such as quest
    completion or NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: First data parameter that can represent various identifiers such
      as quest ID, event ID, or state flag depending on the zone script implementation.
  - name: param1
    description: Second data parameter that typically represents a value associated
      with param0, such as progress level, completion status, or additional flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting quest completion state
    code: "class MyZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void SetData(uint32\
      \ id, uint32 value) override\n    {\n        if (id == 12345 && value == 1)\n\
      \        {\n            // Quest completed\n            // Trigger additional\
      \ actions here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating zone event state
    code: "class BossZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void SetData(uint32\
      \ eventId, uint32 state) override\n    {\n        switch (eventId)\n       \
      \ {\n            case 1:\n                // Boss fight started\n          \
      \      break;\n            case 2:\n                // Boss defeated\n     \
      \           break;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ZoneScript virtual interface and must be overridden
    in derived classes. The parameters are typically used to communicate state changes
    from game systems to zone scripts, but their exact meaning depends on the specific
    implementation within each zone script. Zone scripts should implement this method
    to handle relevant data updates appropriately.
  warnings: Improper handling of parameter values can lead to incorrect quest progression
    or event triggering. Since this is a virtual method, derived classes must properly
    implement it to avoid unexpected behavior in zone-specific events.
