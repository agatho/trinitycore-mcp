  signature: void Guild::SendEventBankMoneyChanged() const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all guild members notifying them of a change in the guild
    bank's money amount.
  description: The SendEventBankMoneyChanged method is responsible for broadcasting
    an update to all online guild members regarding a modification in the guild's
    bank account balance. This function is typically invoked when funds are deposited
    or withdrawn from the guild bank, ensuring that all players with access to the
    guild bank are promptly informed of the updated financial status. The method does
    not directly modify the bank money value itself but rather serves as a notification
    mechanism to synchronize client-side displays with the server's current state.
    It is an essential part of maintaining real-time guild bank synchronization in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.

    code: "void HandleGuildBankDeposit(Player* player, uint32 amount)\n{\n    // ...\
      \ perform deposit logic ...\n    guild->SendEventBankMoneyChanged();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method sends a specific opcode to all connected guild members who have
    the guild bank open. It should be called after any transaction that affects the
    guild's bank money, such as deposits or withdrawals, to maintain consistency between
    server and client states.
