documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the Discipline
    Priest.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with all abilities, spells, and talents available
    to the Discipline Priest class. This method ensures that cooldowns are properly
    tracked and applied during gameplay, preventing players from using abilities before
    their cooldown periods have expired. It typically iterates through the priest's
    spellbook or ability list, checking each ability's current cooldown status and
    updating it based on elapsed time since last use. The method is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and enforcing class-specific mechanics such as mana management, spell
    rotation strategies, and resource allocation.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DisciplinePriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    accurate cooldown tracking. It's typically invoked from within the main AI loop
    or spell casting routines. The implementation may involve checking internal cooldown
    timers and updating them based on game time progression.
  warnings: Improper handling of cooldown states can lead to gameplay imbalance, allowing
    players to spam abilities without proper cooldown restrictions. Ensure this method
    is called consistently and at appropriate intervals to maintain accurate cooldown
    tracking.
