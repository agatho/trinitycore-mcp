documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature's health to its maximum spawn health value.
  description: The SetSpawnHealth method resets the creature's current health to its
    initial maximum health value as defined at spawn time. This method is typically
    used during creature initialization or when respawning a creature to restore it
    to its original health state. The method does not take any parameters and directly
    modifies the creature's health property. It is commonly called internally by the
    TrinityCore framework during creature creation and respawn events, but can also
    be invoked manually by scripts or AI logic when needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Reset() override\n\
      \    {\n        if (Creature* creature = GetCreature())\n        {\n       \
      \     creature->SetSpawnHealth();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Health Restoration in Script
    code: "void RestoreCreatureHealth(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (Creature* creature\
      \ = target->ToCreature())\n    {\n        creature->SetSpawnHealth();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the creature's current health value and does not
    modify any other properties. It should be called after a creature has been damaged
    or modified to restore it to its original spawn state. The method is thread-safe
    as it operates on the creature's internal state which is protected by the game
    world's locking mechanisms.
  warnings: Calling this method on a creature that is currently in combat may cause
    unexpected behavior if other systems are relying on the current health value.
    It should generally be avoided during active combat scenarios unless specifically
    required for respawn mechanics or scripted events.
