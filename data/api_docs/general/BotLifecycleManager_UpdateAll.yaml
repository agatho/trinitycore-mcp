documentation:
  brief: Updates all bot lifecycle states and manages their current execution phase
  description: The UpdateAll method is responsible for processing and updating the
    state of all active bots within the TrinityCore system. It iterates through each
    bot in the managed collection, applying necessary lifecycle transitions and executing
    corresponding behavior updates based on the current game tick. This method typically
    serves as a central coordination point for bot management, ensuring that all bots
    are synchronized with the current game time and state. The method is designed
    to be called regularly by the core game loop to maintain consistent bot behavior
    and responsiveness.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    while (true)\n    {\n        // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n        botLifecycleManager.UpdateAll(diff);\n        // ... rest\
      \ of game loop ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently, typically every game tick or at
    regular intervals to ensure proper bot behavior. It's designed to be non-blocking
    and lightweight to avoid performance issues in the main game loop.
