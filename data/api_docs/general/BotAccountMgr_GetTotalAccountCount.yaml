documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of bot accounts managed by the BotAccountMgr instance
  description: The GetTotalAccountCount method returns the total number of bot accounts
    currently tracked by the BotAccountMgr. This method provides a simple way to query
    the overall size of the bot account database without requiring iteration or complex
    operations. The value returned represents all bot accounts regardless of their
    status, including active, inactive, or deleted accounts. This count is typically
    used for administrative purposes, reporting, or monitoring the scale of bot usage
    within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of bot accounts managed by
    this BotAccountMgr instance. Returns 0 if no bot accounts exist or if the manager
    has not been initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 totalAccounts = sBotAccountMgr->GetTotalAccountCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Total bot accounts: {}", totalAccounts);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Admin Command
    code: "void HandleBotStatsCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    uint32 total =\
      \ sBotAccountMgr->GetTotalAccountCount();\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Bot\
      \ Account Statistics:\");\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Total Accounts: {}\"\
      , total);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be a fast operation as it likely returns a cached
    value or performs a simple database query. The implementation may cache the count
    for performance reasons, so frequent calls should not cause significant overhead.
    This method does not distinguish between different types of bot accounts (e.g.,
    different classes or levels) - it simply counts all accounts.
  warnings: This method assumes that the BotAccountMgr instance has been properly
    initialized before calling. If called on an uninitialized manager, it may return
    incorrect values or cause undefined behavior. Additionally, since this returns
    a count of all accounts, it might include accounts that are no longer valid or
    active in the system.
