documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CategoryPerformanceStats class with default
    values.
  description: The CategoryPerformanceStats constructor initializes a new instance
    of the CategoryPerformanceStats class. This method sets up the internal state
    of the performance statistics object, typically initializing counters, timers,
    or other tracking variables to their default values. In the context of TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring system, this constructor is used to create objects that
    track various performance metrics for different categories within the game server.
    The initialization ensures that all statistical data starts from a known baseline,
    allowing accurate measurement and reporting of performance over time.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new CategoryPerformanceStats instance
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats;

      // The stats object is now initialized with default values

      // ready to begin tracking performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating performance tracking objects. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless they are implementing custom performance monitoring
    features or extending the existing functionality.
