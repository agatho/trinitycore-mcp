  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnRespawn
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnRespawn()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the bot's behavior when it respawns after death in the game world.
  description: The OnRespawn method is invoked when an EnhancedBotAI-controlled bot
    returns to the game world after being killed. This method typically manages the
    bot's respawn logic, including resetting its state, reinitializing AI behaviors,
    and ensuring proper positioning or health restoration. It plays a crucial role
    in maintaining consistent bot behavior across death and respawn cycles within
    TrinityCore's framework. The method is automatically called by the core AI system
    during the respawn process, and developers should not invoke it manually unless
    implementing custom respawn logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Respawn Handling
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnRespawn()\n{\n    // Reset bot's AI state\n    m_aiState\
      \ = BOT_AI_STATE_IDLE;\n    // Restore health and mana\n    SetHealth(GetMaxHealth());\n\
      \    SetMana(GetMaxMana());\n    // Reinitialize target selection\n    SelectNewTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI lifecycle and should not be called directly
    by external code. It's typically triggered by the core TrinityCore respawn system
    when a bot dies and respawns. The method may be overridden in derived classes
    to implement custom respawn behaviors.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method manually as it can lead to inconsistent AI states
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that any override of this method properly initializes
    all necessary bot properties to prevent undefined behavior upon respawn.
