  method: AddStrategy
  signature: void BotAI::AddStrategy(int strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a specified strategy to the bot's AI behavior system.
  description: The AddStrategy method integrates a predefined strategy into the BotAI's
    decision-making framework. This allows bots to dynamically adapt their behavior
    based on different combat or non-combat scenarios. The method takes an integer
    identifier representing a specific strategy and incorporates it into the bot's
    active strategy list. Strategies are typically defined within the TrinityCore
    AI system and can control aspects such as spell casting, movement patterns, target
    selection, and overall tactical approach. This method is essential for customizing
    bot behavior without requiring direct code modification.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: An integer identifier representing a predefined AI strategy. Valid
      values correspond to registered strategy types within the BotAI system. These
      identifiers are typically defined in the game's AI configuration files or through
      enum definitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Addition
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();

      botAI->AddStrategy(1); // Adds the ''Aggressive'' strategy to the bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Strategies for Complex Behavior
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();

      botAI->AddStrategy(2); // Adds ''Defensive'' strategy

      botAI->AddStrategy(5); // Adds ''Healing'' strategy

      botAI->AddStrategy(1); // Adds ''Aggressive'' strategy'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not validate whether the strategy ID exists or is valid before
    adding it. It's recommended to ensure that all strategy IDs passed to this method
    are properly registered within the BotAI system. Adding strategies may affect
    performance if too many are active simultaneously, as each strategy contributes
    to the bot's decision-making overhead.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unregistered strategy ID can lead to undefined behavior
    or runtime errors. Always verify that the strategy identifier corresponds to a
    known and supported AI strategy before calling this method.
