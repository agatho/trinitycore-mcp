  signature: void World::SendServerMessage(ServerMessageType messageID, std::string_view
    stringParam, const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a server message to a specific player with a given message type and
    string parameter.
  description: The SendServerMessage method is used to deliver predefined server messages
    to individual players in the World of Warcraft game. It allows the server to communicate
    various types of information or notifications to players, such as system alerts,
    announcements, or game-related updates. The method takes a ServerMessageType identifier
    that determines the kind of message being sent, along with an optional string
    parameter for additional context or content. This function is typically used by
    game systems, modules, or scripts to provide feedback or information directly
    to players in their client interface.
  parameters:
  - name: messageID
    description: The ServerMessageType identifier that specifies the type of server
      message to send. Valid values are defined in the ServerMessageType enumeration
      and correspond to different UI elements or notification types in the client.
  - name: stringParam
    description: A string parameter that provides additional content or data for the
      server message. The meaning and usage of this parameter depends on the specific
      message type being sent, and may include placeholders or dynamic values.
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the recipient of the
      server message. If null, the message will not be sent. This parameter is required
      for targeting a specific player in the game world.
  returns: None. The method performs an action and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Send a system announcement to a player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume player is already obtained

      World::SendServerMessage(SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPE_ARENA, "Welcome to the arena!",
      targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send an error message to a specific player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already obtained

      World::SendServerMessage(SERVER_MESSAGE_TYPE_ERROR, "Invalid command syntax.",
      player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client-side UI rendering system.
    The actual appearance and handling of messages depend on how the client interprets
    the ServerMessageType enum values. It's important to ensure that the stringParam
    is properly sanitized to avoid potential client-side issues or exploits.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will result in no message
    being sent. Ensure that all Player pointers are valid before calling this method.
    Incorrect usage of ServerMessageType values may lead to undefined behavior or
    missing UI elements on the client side.
