  signature: bool CreatureGroup::LeaderHasStringId(int id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature group's leader has a specific string ID assigned to
    it.
  description: The LeaderHasStringId method determines whether the leader of a creature
    group possesses a particular string identifier. This functionality is typically
    used in WoW AI scripting and quest systems where creatures are grouped together
    and need to be identified by unique string IDs for various game mechanics such
    as quest tracking, scripted behaviors, or event triggers. The method performs
    a lookup against the leader's assigned string ID and returns true if it matches
    the provided ID, otherwise false. It is commonly used in conjunction with creature
    group management systems within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature group's leader has the specified string ID;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for a specific string ID
    code: "if (creatureGroup->LeaderHasStringId(12345)) {\n    // Perform action when\
      \ leader has string ID 12345\n    creatureGroup->GetLeader()->Say(\"I have the\
      \ correct ID!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature group's leader has been properly initialized
    and contains a valid string ID. The string ID comparison is case-sensitive and
    exact match. Performance-wise, this operation should be relatively fast as it
    involves a simple lookup in the leader's data structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature group and its leader are valid before calling
    this method to avoid potential null pointer dereferences. Also note that string
    IDs may not be unique across all creatures in the world, so make sure your ID
    selection is appropriate for your use case.
