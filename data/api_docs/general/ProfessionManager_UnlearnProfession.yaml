  signature: bool ProfessionManager::UnlearnProfession(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified profession from the player's skill list.
  description: The UnlearnProfession method removes a given profession from the player's
    learned skills. It takes a pointer to a player object and a ProfessionType enumeration
    value representing the skill to be unlearned. The method returns true if the profession
    was successfully removed, or false if the operation failed. This functionality
    is typically used in game mechanics where players can lose professions through
    various events such as quest completions, item usage, or administrative actions.
    The method ensures that the player's profession data is properly updated and persisted
    in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object from which the profession will be unlearned.
      Must not be null.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value of type ProfessionType representing the specific
      profession to remove. Valid values correspond to known professions in the game.
  returns: Returns true if the profession was successfully removed from the player's
    skill list, false otherwise. Failure may occur if the player does not have the
    specified profession or if there are database errors during the update process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nProfessionType profession\
      \ = PROFESSION_ENGINERING;\nbool success = sProfessionManager->UnlearnProfession(&player,\
      \ profession);\nif (success) {\n    // Profession successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Unlearning
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->HasSkill(PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING))\
      \ {\n    sProfessionManager->UnlearnProfession(&player, PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING);\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Your blacksmithing skill has been forgotten.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to persist changes to the
    player's profession data. It may also trigger updates to the player's UI and related
    game state. The method assumes that the player object is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method.
    Improper use can lead to undefined behavior or database corruption. This method
    should only be called when appropriate in the game flow to avoid breaking quest
    progression or skill mechanics.
