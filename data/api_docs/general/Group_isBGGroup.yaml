documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is currently assigned to a Battle Ground.
  description: The isBGGroup() method checks if the Group object represents a group
    that is currently participating in or assigned to a Battle Ground scenario. This
    method returns true if the group is actively involved in a Battle Ground activity,
    such as being part of a battleground queue or already inside a battleground instance.
    It's commonly used to differentiate between regular player groups and those that
    are specifically engaged in competitive battlefield activities. The check typically
    involves verifying internal group state flags or references to active battleground
    instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is currently assigned to or participating in
    a Battle Ground, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group is in BG
    code: "if (group->isBGGroup()) {\n    // Handle logic for battleground groups\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Group is currently in a battleground.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle regular group logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is not in a\
      \ battleground.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the Group class to determine
    battleground status. It does not perform any external API calls or database lookups,
    making it efficient for frequent checks during gameplay loops.
