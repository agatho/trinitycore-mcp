  method: Invite
  signature: void Channel::Invite(const Player * player, const std::string & newp)
documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the channel
  description: The Invite method adds a specified player to the channel, sending an
    invitation message to that player. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's chat system where players can form groups through channels
    such as guild channels or general chat channels. The method does not validate
    whether the target player is already in the channel or if they have permission
    to join. It simply sends the invitation and assumes the recipient will accept
    it. This functionality is part of TrinityCore's implementation of the game's communication
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is sending
      the invitation. Must not be null.
  - name: newp
    description: String containing the name of the player being invited. This should
      match the exact case-sensitive name of the target player in the game database.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Invitation
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Guild1\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->Invite(player, \"TargetPlayer\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore channel management system
    and assumes proper initialization of the channel manager. It does not perform
    any checks for player online status or channel membership before sending the invitation.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'player' parameter is valid and not null, otherwise the
    method may cause undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about inviting players
    who are already in the channel as it could lead to duplicate invitations or unexpected
    behavior.
