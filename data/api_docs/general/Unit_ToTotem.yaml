  method: ToTotem
  signature: const Totem * Unit::ToTotem() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the Totem object associated with this Unit.
  description: The ToTotem method retrieves the Totem object that is currently associated
    with the Unit. This method is typically used in the context of player or creature
    units that have a Totem summoned, such as shaman's totems or other summoning spells.
    The returned pointer may be null if no totem is currently active or if the unit
    does not have a totem assigned. This method provides access to the totem's properties
    and functionality, including its GUID, slot, and duration, making it essential
    for managing totem-related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Totem object associated with this Unit. If no
    totem is active or assigned, the method returns nullptr. The returned pointer
    can be used to access totem-specific properties such as its GUID, slot, and duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Totem* totem = unit->ToTotem();\nif (totem != nullptr)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use totem\n    uint32 guid = totem->GetGUID();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other totem-related methods
    such as ToTotemSlot or ToTotemDuration. The method is thread-safe and does not
    require any special handling for concurrent access. It should be noted that the
    returned pointer may become invalid if the totem is removed or despawned.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if no totem is active, so developers should
    always check for null before accessing totem properties. Additionally, this method
    does not perform any validation on the totem itself, so it's possible to access
    a totem that has already been destroyed or removed.
