  class: GuildBankManager
  method: UpdateItemPrices
  signature: void GuildBankManager::UpdateItemPrices(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Updates item prices in the guild bank based on current market values or configured
    pricing rules.
  description: The UpdateItemPrices method recalculates and applies updated pricing
    information for items stored within the guild bank. This functionality is typically
    used to synchronize item costs with real-time market data or predefined pricing
    policies. The method iterates through all items in the guild's bank inventory
    and adjusts their listed prices according to configured rules or external market
    conditions. It ensures that guild members see accurate pricing when withdrawing
    or depositing items, maintaining consistency between in-game economy mechanics
    and stored item values.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      determines which specific guild's bank inventory will have its item prices updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Prices for a Specific Guild
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager* bankManager = sGuildBankMgr;

      bankManager->UpdateItemPrices(&guildId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers database updates to persist new pricing information.
    It may be called periodically by the server or upon specific events like market
    data refreshes. The implementation might involve locking mechanisms to prevent
    concurrent modifications during price updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild identifier passed is valid and corresponds to an
    existing guild, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method modifies database
    records and should not be called excessively without proper throttling to avoid
    performance degradation.
