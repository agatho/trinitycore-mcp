  method: HandlePlayerIncapacitation
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandlePlayerIncapacitation(Group * group,
    Player * incapacitatedPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the incapacitation of a player within an instance group by managing
    group state and coordination.
  description: The HandlePlayerIncapacitation method is responsible for processing
    the incapacitation event of a player within a group context in a World of Warcraft
    instance. When a player becomes incapacitated, this method ensures that the group's
    coordination logic is updated appropriately, potentially triggering respawn mechanics,
    loot distribution adjustments, or other instance-specific behaviors. It takes
    the group and the incapacitated player as parameters to perform necessary state
    transitions and notifications. This method is typically invoked during instance
    encounters where player status changes can affect overall group progression or
    encounter outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that contains the incapacitated player.
      Must be a valid group pointer, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: incapacitatedPlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who has become
      incapacitated. Must not be null and must belong to the provided group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance encounter
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && player->IsInWorld()) {\n\
      \    InstanceCoordination::HandlePlayerIncapacitation(group, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat system
    code: "void CombatHandler::OnPlayerKilled(Player* player) {\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isInInstance()) {\n       \
      \ InstanceCoordination::HandlePlayerIncapacitation(group, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal instance coordination systems
    to manage player states and group dynamics. It may trigger events or update timers
    related to respawn mechanics. Developers should ensure that the provided group
    and player pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null parameters can lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the player is actually part of the group before
    invoking this function. The method assumes the player's incapacitation state has
    already been properly set in the game logic.
