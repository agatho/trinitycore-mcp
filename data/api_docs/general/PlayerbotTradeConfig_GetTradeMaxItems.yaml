  method: GetTradeMaxItems
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeMaxItems()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum number of items allowed in a trade window for player
    bot characters.
  description: The GetTradeMaxItems method returns the configured maximum number of
    items that can be placed in a trade window by player bot characters. This value
    is typically defined within the TrinityCore configuration files or through in-game
    settings related to player bot behavior. The returned value represents the upper
    limit for item stacking during trade operations, ensuring that bots do not exceed
    allowed trade constraints. This method is essential for maintaining game balance
    and preventing exploitation of trade mechanics by automated player characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of items permitted in a
    player bot's trade window. Returns zero if the configuration value is invalid
    or not set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxItems = bot->GetTradeMaxItems();\nif (maxItems > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with trade logic using maxItems\n    sLog->outString(\"Maximum trade\
      \ items allowed: %u\", maxItems);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from configuration settings specific to player bot
    behavior. The value may be overridden by server-side configurations or in-game
    settings that affect how bots interact with trade mechanics.
