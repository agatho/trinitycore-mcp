  class: ConversationAI
  method: GetGUID
  signature: int ConversationAI::GetGUID(int32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of a conversation entity by its ID.
  description: The GetGUID method in the ConversationAI class is used to obtain the
    globally unique identifier associated with a specific conversation entity. This
    identifier is crucial for tracking and managing conversations within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly when dealing with NPC dialogues, quest interactions, or
    other interactive game elements. The method takes an integer ID parameter that
    corresponds to a specific conversation instance and returns its associated GUID.
    This GUID can then be used to reference the conversation in various game systems
    such as player interaction tracking, dialogue state management, or event triggering
    mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the conversation entity to retrieve the
      GUID for. This is typically an integer value that corresponds to a specific
      conversation instance within the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the globally unique identifier (GUID) of
    the conversation entity. If no valid conversation exists with the provided ID,
    the method may return zero or a negative value indicating an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int conversationGuid = conversationAI->GetGUID(12345);\nif (conversationGuid\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the GUID for further operations\n    printf(\"Conversation\
      \ GUID: %d\\n\", conversationGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int guid = conversationAI->GetGUID(99999);\nif (guid <= 0)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid conversation ID\n    printf(\"Invalid conversation ID provided\\n\"\
      );\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with valid GUID\n    printf(\"Retrieved GUID:\
      \ %d\\n\", guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the conversation entity with the specified ID exists
    in the system. It's recommended to validate the returned GUID value before using
    it in critical operations. The implementation likely involves internal lookup
    tables or database queries to map IDs to GUIDs, so performance may vary depending
    on system load and data structure efficiency.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid or out-of-range ID values
    as it might lead to undefined behavior or return invalid GUIDs. Always verify
    that the conversation exists before calling this method. In multi-threaded environments,
    ensure proper synchronization when accessing conversation data structures.
