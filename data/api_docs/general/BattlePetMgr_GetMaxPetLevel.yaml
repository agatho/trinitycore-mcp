documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum level a battle pet can reach in the current game context.
  description: The GetMaxPetLevel method retrieves the highest allowable level for
    battle pets within the active game session or player's current context. This value
    is typically determined by the player's level, expansion content, or server configuration
    settings. The returned integer represents the upper bound of pet leveling progression
    and may vary depending on the specific World of Warcraft expansion or game mode
    being played. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum level a battle pet can achieve. Typical
    values range from 1 to 25, though this may be adjusted by server settings or game
    updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int maxLevel = battlePetMgr->GetMaxPetLevel();

      printf("Maximum pet level: %d\n", maxLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Pet Level Validation
    code: "int currentPetLevel = pet->GetLevel();\nint maxPetLevel = battlePetMgr->GetMaxPetLevel();\n\
      if (currentPetLevel >= maxPetLevel) {\n    // Pet has reached maximum level\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"Your pet has reached its maximum level.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or calculated once per session and does not
    perform real-time computations. It may be affected by expansion-specific rules
    or server-side configurations that define pet progression limits.
