  signature: int DungeonScript::CalculateRangedPosition(int * player, int * boss)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the ranged position between a player and boss for
    dungeon combat mechanics.
  description: The CalculateRangedPosition method computes the appropriate ranged
    positioning logic between a player and boss entity within a dungeon scenario.
    This method is typically used to determine optimal or required positioning for
    ranged attacks, spell casting, or combat mechanics that depend on distance calculations.
    The method takes two integer pointers representing player and boss positions and
    returns an integer value indicating the calculated ranged position result. It's
    commonly utilized in dungeon scripts to enforce positioning requirements for specific
    encounters or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's position coordinate
      in the dungeon environment
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's position coordinate
      in the dungeon environment
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated ranged position result.
    The specific meaning of this value depends on the implementation context, but
    typically indicates a valid positioning state or error code for combat mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon script
    code: "int playerPos = 100;\nint bossPos = 250;\nint result = dungeonScript->CalculateRangedPosition(&playerPos,\
      \ &bossPos);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Valid ranged position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic positioning
    code: "int playerX = player->GetPositionX();\nint bossX = boss->GetPositionX();\n\
      int result = dungeonScript->CalculateRangedPosition(&playerX, &bossX);\nif (result\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Positioning requirements met\n    player->CastSpell(boss, SPELL_RANGED_ATTACK,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon encounter scripting system and should
    only be called during active combat scenarios. The integer values passed to this
    method represent coordinate positions within the dungeon's coordinate system.
    Implementation may vary based on specific dungeon mechanics or encounter design
    requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and boss pointers are valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause undefined behavior. The return
    value should always be checked for error conditions in production code.
