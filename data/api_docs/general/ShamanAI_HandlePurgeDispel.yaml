  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandlePurgeDispel
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandlePurgeDispel(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic for purging or dispelling harmful effects on a target unit.
  description: The HandlePurgeDispel method in the ShamanAI class is responsible for
    managing the behavior of shaman AI when attempting to remove or cleanse debuffs
    from a target unit. This typically involves checking if the target has applicable
    harmful effects that can be removed, selecting an appropriate spell or ability
    to perform the purge, and executing the dispel action. The method returns true
    if the dispel was successfully initiated or executed, and false otherwise. It
    is part of the general AI behavior for shaman NPCs, ensuring they properly manage
    their target's debuffs in combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      target unit to purge or dispel effects from. This parameter is used internally
      by the AI to determine which unit should be affected by the dispel action.
  returns: Returns true if the dispel action was successfully initiated or executed
    on the target, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no valid
    debuffs were found on the target, or that the AI failed to perform the dispel
    due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Shaman AI context
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandlePurgeDispel(&targetId)) {\n    // Dispelling was successful\n\
      \    // Perform additional actions if needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used within the broader context of a shaman's AI decision-making
    loop, where it evaluates whether to dispel debuffs on allies or enemies. The implementation
    may rely on internal state tracking of target debuffs and available spells in
    the shaman's spellbook.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid index could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that not all debuffs are eligible for dispelling, depending on
    game mechanics and spell restrictions.
