  class: RuneManager
  method: RuneManager
  signature: void RuneManager::RuneManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a RuneManager instance for the specified player, setting up rune
    tracking and management for death knights.
  description: The RuneManager constructor initializes the rune management system
    for a player, typically used by death knight classes to track their rune cooldowns
    and availability. This method sets up internal data structures to monitor rune
    states, including which runes are currently on cooldown and which are ready for
    use. The initialization process ensures that the player's rune system is properly
    integrated with the game's combat mechanics, allowing for accurate rune regeneration
    timing and usage tracking during gameplay. This constructor is usually called
    during player login or class specialization changes when a death knight character
    is initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that this RuneManager will manage runes
      for. Must be a valid player instance with death knight class, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic RuneManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myDeathKnight = ...; // Get player reference

      RuneManager* runeMgr = new RuneManager(myDeathKnight); // Initialize rune manager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called for death knight players. The RuneManager
    assumes the player has a valid death knight class and will not properly initialize
    for other classes. Internal rune data structures are initialized to default states
    representing all runes as available.
  warnings: Calling this constructor with a non-death knight player may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure proper class validation before initialization. The
    constructor does not perform any validation on the Player pointer, so passing
    null may lead to segmentation faults.
