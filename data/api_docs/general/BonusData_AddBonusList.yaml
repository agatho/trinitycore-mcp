  class: BonusData
  method: AddBonusList
  signature: void BonusData::AddBonusList(uint32 bonusListId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a bonus list identifier to the current bonus data container.
  description: The AddBonusList method is used to incorporate a specified bonus list
    ID into the internal collection of bonus lists associated with a given object
    or context. This functionality is typically employed in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to manage item bonuses, enchantments, or other game mechanics that rely
    on bonus list IDs. The method does not return any value and directly modifies
    the state of the BonusData instance by appending the provided bonusListId to its
    collection. It is commonly used during item creation, equipment changes, or when
    applying temporary buffs that are defined through bonus lists.
  parameters:
  - name: bonusListId
    description: A unique identifier representing a specific bonus list in the game's
      database. This ID corresponds to entries in the BonusList table and defines
      which bonuses should be applied to an item or effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Bonus List to Item
    code: 'BonusData bonusData;

      bonusData.AddBonusList(12345);

      // The bonus list with ID 12345 is now included in the bonus data.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Bonus Lists
    code: 'BonusData bonusData;

      bonusData.AddBonusList(1001);

      bonusData.AddBonusList(1002);

      bonusData.AddBonusList(1003);

      // Three bonus lists are now active in the bonus data.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bonusListId provided is valid and exists within
    the game's database. Invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or missing bonuses
    during gameplay. The order in which bonus lists are added can affect how they
    interact, especially if there are conflicts between different bonus effects.
  warnings: Adding an invalid or non-existent bonusListId can cause issues with item
    properties or game mechanics. Ensure that all bonus list IDs passed to this method
    are verified against the database before calling. Avoid calling this method in
    performance-critical sections without checking for potential side effects from
    bonus interactions.
