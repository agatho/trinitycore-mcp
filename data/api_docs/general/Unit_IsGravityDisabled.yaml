  class: Unit
  method: IsGravityDisabled
  signature: bool Unit::IsGravityDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether gravity is disabled for the unit.
  description: This method checks if the unit has gravity disabled, which typically
    occurs when the unit is in a state where gravity effects are suspended or overridden.
    This can happen during certain game mechanics such as being in flight, being affected
    by specific spells, or when the unit is in a special movement state. The method
    returns true if gravity is disabled and false otherwise, indicating whether the
    unit is currently affected by gravity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if gravity is disabled for the unit, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the unit is not subject to normal gravitational forces.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsGravityDisabled())\n    {\n        // Unit is not affected\
      \ by gravity\n    }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in movement logic and game state checks. It
    may be influenced by various spell effects or movement states that disable gravity,
    so developers should consider all possible conditions that might affect this flag.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can be affected by multiple factors
    including movement states, spell effects, and special game mechanics. The result
    may change dynamically during gameplay.
