  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecutePriestInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecutePriestInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the target unit's current spell cast if it matches the specified
    spell ID.
  description: The ExecutePriestInterrupt method is designed to handle the logic for
    interrupting a target unit's ongoing spell casting, specifically tailored for
    priest class abilities. It evaluates whether the target unit is currently casting
    a spell that matches the provided spell ID and attempts to interrupt that cast.
    This functionality is typically used in AI behavior scripts to manage spell priorities
    and prevent undesirable spell completion. The method ensures proper validation
    of the target unit and spell ID before attempting the interruption, and returns
    an ActionResult indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot performing the
      interrupt action.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell cast
      is to be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be interrupted on the target
      unit. Must correspond to a valid spell in the game database.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the interrupt attempt.
    Possible values include SUCCESS if the interruption was successful, FAILED if
    it could not be performed due to invalid parameters or state, and potentially
    other status codes depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: ActionResult result = action.ExecutePriestInterrupt(ai, targetUnit, 12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error handling
    code: "if (targetUnit && targetUnit->IsCasting()) {\n    ActionResult result =\
      \ action.ExecutePriestInterrupt(ai, targetUnit, 12345);\n    if (result == SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n        // Interrupt successful\n    } else {\n        // Handle failure\
      \ case\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has proper access to the target unit and
    spell data. It may not work correctly if called on units that are not currently
    casting spells or when the spell ID does not match an active cast. Performance
    is generally low as it involves checking spell states and potentially triggering
    network updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and actively casting before calling
    this method, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or failed interruptions.
    Also, be cautious about interrupting spells with high priority or critical effects,
    as this could disrupt gameplay balance.
