  signature: void GuildBankManager::ExecuteOrganizationPlan(int * player, const BankOrganizationPlan
    & plan)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a bank organization plan for a guild member, applying configured
    item sorting and management rules.
  description: The ExecuteOrganizationPlan method applies a predefined bank organization
    plan to a specified guild member's bank inventory. This function orchestrates
    the rearrangement of items within the guild bank based on the rules defined in
    the BankOrganizationPlan parameter. It typically handles operations such as sorting
    items by type, quality, or other criteria, and may move items between different
    slots or containers within the guild bank. The method operates on a per-player
    basis, using the provided player identifier to determine which guild member's
    inventory should be organized according to the plan. This functionality is commonly
    used in automated guild bank management systems where players can define custom
    sorting rules that are then executed periodically or upon specific triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for whom the organization plan should be executed. Must point to a valid
      guild member's GUID.
  - name: plan
    description: Reference to a BankOrganizationPlan object containing the configuration
      and rules for organizing the guild bank items. Defines sorting criteria, item
      placement logic, and management behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      BankOrganizationPlan plan;

      plan.SetSortOrder(BankOrganizationPlan::SORT_BY_ITEM_TYPE);

      plan.SetAutoDeposit(true);

      guildBankManager.ExecuteOrganizationPlan(&playerId, plan);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Plan Configuration
    code: 'int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      BankOrganizationPlan plan;

      plan.SetSortOrder(BankOrganizationPlan::SORT_BY_ITEM_QUALITY);

      plan.SetMaxItemsPerSlot(10);

      plan.SetAutoRepair(true);

      plan.SetAutoEnchant(true);

      guildBankManager.ExecuteOrganizationPlan(&playerId, plan);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the guild bank management system
    and may involve multiple database operations to persist changes. The player parameter
    must reference a valid guild member who has access to the guild bank. Performance
    impact can be significant when processing large inventories, especially with complex
    sorting rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID points to an actual guild member, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. The method modifies the guild bank inventory directly
    and should only be called when appropriate permissions are granted. Be cautious
    when using plans with auto-enchant or auto-repair features as they can consume
    significant resources.
