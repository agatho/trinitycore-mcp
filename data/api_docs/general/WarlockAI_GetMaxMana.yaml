  class: WarlockAI
  method: GetMaxMana
  signature: uint32 WarlockAI::GetMaxMana()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum mana value of the warlock AI instance.
  description: The GetMaxMana method retrieves the maximum mana capacity for a WarlockAI
    instance. This value represents the highest amount of mana that the warlock can
    possess at any given time, which is crucial for managing spell casting and resource
    allocation in the game. The returned value is typically used by the AI system
    to determine when to cast mana-intensive spells or when to conserve resources.
    This method does not modify any internal state and serves purely as a read-only
    accessor for the warlock's maximum mana.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum mana capacity of the WarlockAI
    instance. This value corresponds to the total mana points the warlock can hold,
    which may vary based on level, equipment, buffs, and other game mechanics affecting
    mana regeneration and capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 maxMana = warlockAI->GetMaxMana();\nif (maxMana > 1000)\n{\n   \
      \ // Perform actions based on high mana capacity\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Management Check
    code: "uint32 currentMana = warlockAI->GetMana();\nuint32 maxMana = warlockAI->GetMaxMana();\n\
      float manaPercentage = (float)currentMana / (float)maxMana * 100.0f;\nif (manaPercentage\
      \ > 80.0f)\n{\n    // Consider casting mana-consuming spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes to evaluate
    resource availability. The returned value may change dynamically as the warlock
    levels up, equips items, or gains buffs that affect maximum mana. It's important
    to note that this method returns the base maximum mana without considering temporary
    modifiers such as potion effects or short-term buff stacks.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly modify the warlock's mana state.
    The returned value is a snapshot of the current maximum capacity and may not reflect
    real-time changes in mana due to external factors like buffs or debuffs that are
    applied during gameplay.
