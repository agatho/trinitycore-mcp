  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot world session manager, cleaning up all active bot sessions
    and releasing associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all active bot sessions managed by the
    BotWorldSessionMgr class. It ensures proper cleanup of resources associated with
    each bot session, including disconnecting bots from the game world and freeing
    memory allocated for bot data structures. This method is typically invoked during
    server shutdown or when the bot system needs to be temporarily disabled. The method
    performs a graceful shutdown, ensuring that no active bot operations are interrupted
    abruptly. It also handles cleanup of any internal data structures used by the
    session manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotWorldSessionMgr::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where no
    active bot operations are occurring. Calling this during active bot gameplay may
    result in unexpected behavior or data corruption. The shutdown process is synchronous
    and will block until all sessions are properly terminated.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bots are actively engaged in combat or other critical
    operations may lead to loss of game state or corrupted data. Ensure all bot activities
    are paused or completed before invoking this method.
