  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetCurrencyContainerForCurrencyQuantity
  signature: const CurrencyContainerEntry * DB2Manager::GetCurrencyContainerForCurrencyQuantity(uint32
    currencyId, int32 quantity) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the currency container entry associated with a specific currency
    ID and quantity.
  description: This method looks up and returns a CurrencyContainerEntry that corresponds
    to the given currency identifier and quantity. It is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's currency system, where items or rewards are tied to specific
    currencies and their quantities. The lookup process involves searching through
    internal DB2 data structures to find matching entries. This function does not
    perform any validation on input parameters beyond standard type checking; invalid
    currency IDs or quantities may result in a null return value.
  parameters:
  - name: currencyId
    description: The unique identifier of the currency to search for within the container
      system.
  - name: quantity
    description: The quantity threshold used to determine which container entry matches
      the specified currency and amount.
  returns: A pointer to a CurrencyContainerEntry if a matching entry is found; otherwise,
    returns nullptr when no match exists or on invalid inputs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const CurrencyContainerEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetCurrencyContainerForCurrencyQuantity(1234,\
      \ 50);\nif (entry)\n{\n    // Process the found currency container\n    printf(\"\
      Found container for currency %u with quantity %d\\n\", entry->CurrencyID, entry->Quantity);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 currencyId = 5678;\nint32 quantity = 1000;\nconst CurrencyContainerEntry*\
      \ container = sDB2Manager->GetCurrencyContainerForCurrencyQuantity(currencyId,\
      \ quantity);\nif (!container)\n{\n    // Handle case where no matching container\
      \ was found\n    sLog->outError(\"No currency container found for currency ID\
      \ %u and quantity %d\", currencyId, quantity);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Use the retrieved\
      \ container entry\n    // e.g., award rewards based on container data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 database tables that must be loaded before
    use. Performance depends on how efficiently the underlying lookup mechanism is
    implemented, typically using hash maps or binary search structures for fast access.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method with invalid currency IDs or negative
    quantities as it may lead to unexpected behavior or return null pointers without
    explicit error reporting.
