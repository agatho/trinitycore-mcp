  class: HolyPaladinBeaconTracker
  method: SetPrimaryBeacon
  signature: void HolyPaladinBeaconTracker::SetPrimaryBeacon(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the primary beacon GUID for a Holy Paladin.
  description: The SetPrimaryBeacon method assigns a specified GUID as the primary
    beacon target for a Holy Paladin. This functionality is typically used in conjunction
    with the Beacon of Light ability, which allows paladins to transfer healing to
    another player when they are healed. The method updates internal tracking state
    to reflect the new primary beacon target. It is expected that the provided GUID
    corresponds to a valid unit within the game world. This method does not perform
    any validation on the GUID itself but relies on the underlying system to handle
    invalid or non-existent targets gracefully.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will
      become the primary beacon. Must be a valid GUID representing a unit in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Primary Beacon to Target
    code: "HolyPaladinBeaconTracker tracker;\nUnit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\n\
      if (target)\n{\n    tracker.SetPrimaryBeacon(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal beacon tracking system for Holy Paladins.
    It is likely called automatically by the game engine when a player selects a new
    beacon target or when the Beacon of Light spell is cast. The GUID parameter should
    represent a valid unit; otherwise, behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual unit
    in the world. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes if not handled properly by the underlying systems.
