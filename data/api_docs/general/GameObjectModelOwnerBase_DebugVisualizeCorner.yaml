documentation:
  brief: Visualizes the corner points of a game object model for debugging purposes.
  description: The DebugVisualizeCorner method is used to display or render the corner
    points of a GameObjectModel within the game world for debugging and development
    purposes. This method likely creates visual markers or debug geometry at the corners
    of the object's bounding box or collision mesh. It is typically invoked during
    development or debugging sessions to help developers understand the spatial dimensions
    and positioning of game objects in the world. The method operates on the GameObjectModelOwnerBase
    class, which manages the relationship between game objects and their associated
    model data. This functionality is particularly useful for identifying issues related
    to object placement, collision detection, or spatial bounds in the TrinityCore
    engine.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that likely controls the visualization behavior
      or specifies which corner points to display. The exact meaning of this parameter
      may depend on internal implementation details and could represent a bitmask,
      index, or mode selector for the debug visualization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Visualization Call
    code: 'GameObjectModelOwnerBase* owner = ...; // Get reference to game object
      model owner

      owner->DebugVisualizeCorner(1); // Visualize first corner or enable specific
      debug mode'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging only. It should not
    be used in production code as it likely has performance implications due to rendering
    additional debug geometry. The exact behavior of the visualization may vary depending
    on the game client's debug settings or available rendering capabilities.
  warnings: Using this method in a live environment may cause unexpected visual artifacts
    or performance degradation. Ensure that this functionality is only enabled during
    development or testing phases. The parameter value should be validated to prevent
    undefined behavior if it represents an index into a limited set of corners.
