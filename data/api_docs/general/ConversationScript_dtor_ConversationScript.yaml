documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ConversationScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ConversationScript destructor is automatically invoked when a ConversationScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, registered callbacks, or internal
    state associated with the conversation script. In TrinityCore's context, this
    typically occurs during server shutdown, zone changes, or when removing custom
    conversation behaviors from game entities. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no explicit return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ConversationScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ConversationScript* script = new ConversationScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~ConversationScript()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing
    object lifecycle. The destructor is virtual in base classes, so proper polymorphic
    behavior is expected when inheriting from ConversationScript.
