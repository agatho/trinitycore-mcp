  class: DemonologyDemonTracker
  method: GetActiveDemonCount
  signature: uint32 DemonologyDemonTracker::GetActiveDemonCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active demons currently summoned by the warlock.
  description: The GetActiveDemonCount method retrieves the number of active demonic
    minions currently under the control of a warlock player. This includes all summoned
    demons such as Voidwalkers, Felhunters, Succubi, and other demon servants that
    are currently active in the game world. The count is updated dynamically as demons
    are summoned, dismissed, or removed due to various game mechanics like death,
    duration expiration, or manual dismissal. This method is typically used by the
    Demonology specialization's tracking system to manage demon-related abilities,
    cooldowns, and resource calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active demons currently
    summoned by the warlock. Returns 0 if no demons are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Demons
    code: "uint32 activeCount = demonologyTracker->GetActiveDemonCount();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with demon-based abilities\n    // Example: Apply\
      \ demon-related buffs or effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Count for Ability Validation
    code: "uint32 demonCount = demonologyTracker->GetActiveDemonCount();\nif (demonCount\
      \ < 3)\n{\n    // Allow summoning another demon\n    // Example: Check if player\
      \ can summon a new demon\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Prevent summoning more demons\n\
      \    // Example: Send error message or prevent ability execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DemonologyDemonTracker class which specifically
    tracks warlock demon-related states. The returned count includes all active demonic
    minions regardless of their specific type, and excludes any inactive or dead demons.
    This method should be called frequently during gameplay to maintain accurate tracking
    of demon states.
  warnings: The method does not account for temporary invisibility or stealth states
    that might affect demon visibility but not their active status. Also, this count
    may not immediately reflect changes if the game state is in a transition phase
    (e.g., during combat transitions).
