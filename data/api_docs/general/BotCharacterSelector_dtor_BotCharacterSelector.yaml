documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotCharacterSelector instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotCharacterSelector class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method
    ensures proper cleanup of character selection logic and related data structures
    when a BotCharacterSelector instance is no longer needed. This typically involves
    releasing references to player characters, clearing internal caches, and performing
    any necessary finalization steps before the object is fully removed from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of BotCharacterSelector
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotCharacterSelector selector;\n    // Use\
      \ selector...\n    // Destructor called automatically when selector goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ destructor and will be invoked automatically by the
    runtime when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers
    should not manually call this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns.
