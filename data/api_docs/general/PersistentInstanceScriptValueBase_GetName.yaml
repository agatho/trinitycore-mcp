documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the persistent instance script value.
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    a PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase object. This name is typically used for identification
    purposes within the TrinityCore framework, particularly when managing persistent
    data tied to instance scripts. The returned string is null-terminated and should
    not be modified or freed by the caller. The method is const, ensuring it does
    not alter the object's state during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character array representing the name of
    the persistent instance script value. Returns nullptr if no valid name has been
    set or if the object is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase* scriptValue = ...;\nconst char* name\
      \ = scriptValue->GetName();\nif (name != nullptr)\n{\n    printf(\"Script value\
      \ name: %s\\n\", name);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is valid only as long as the PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase
    object remains alive and its name has not been changed. This method is intended
    for read-only access and should be used in a thread-safe context if the underlying
    object might be modified concurrently.
