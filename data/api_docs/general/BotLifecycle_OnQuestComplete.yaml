  class: BotLifecycle
  method: OnQuestComplete
  signature: void BotLifecycle::OnQuestComplete(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the completion of a quest for a bot character in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The OnQuestComplete method is invoked when a bot character successfully
    completes a quest within the World of Warcraft emulation environment. This method
    serves as a callback mechanism that allows the bot lifecycle management system
    to execute specific logic upon quest completion, such as updating quest progress,
    rewarding items or experience, triggering subsequent quest events, or modifying
    the bot's behavior based on quest completion status. The method is typically called
    by the core game engine when a quest objective is fulfilled and the quest state
    transitions to complete.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that was completed. This value
      corresponds to the QuestTemplate entry in the database and is used to determine
      which quest-specific actions should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic quest completion handling
    code: "void BotLifecycle::OnQuestComplete(uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Log the quest\
      \ completion\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot completed quest: %u\", questId);\n \
      \   \n    // Reward the bot with experience\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n \
      \   if (bot)\n        bot->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot lifecycle management system and should be
    implemented to handle quest-specific logic without blocking the main game thread.
    It's recommended to avoid heavy computations or database access within this method
    to maintain performance.
  warnings: Improper handling of quest completion may lead to inconsistent quest states,
    missing rewards, or unexpected behavior in bot AI. Ensure that all quest-related
    data is properly validated before processing.
