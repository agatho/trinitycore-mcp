  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: Update
  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active Outdoor PvP systems with the specified time delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and advancing the state
    of all currently active Outdoor PvP zones within the TrinityCore server. It iterates
    through all registered OutdoorPvP objects and calls their individual update logic,
    typically handling timer-based events, player interactions, and zone state changes.
    This method is usually invoked from the main game loop at regular intervals to
    ensure that Outdoor PvP systems remain synchronized with the passage of time and
    player activities. The diff parameter represents the time elapsed since the last
    update in milliseconds, which is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior across
    different server performance conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      determines how much time has passed and is used to advance timers and process
      time-dependent Outdoor PvP events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    sOutdoorPvPMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Performance Consideration
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Only update Outdoor PvP if there\
      \ are active zones\n    if (sOutdoorPvPMgr->HasActiveZones())\n        sOutdoorPvPMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game world update loop. The
    implementation should be efficient as it's called frequently and may impact overall
    server performance if not optimized. OutdoorPvP systems are designed to handle
    time-based events, so accurate timing through the diff parameter is essential
    for proper operation.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from within other OutdoorPvP update logic
    as it could cause recursion or race conditions. Ensure that the diff value passed
    is accurate and represents actual elapsed time to maintain correct behavior of
    time-sensitive Outdoor PvP mechanics.
