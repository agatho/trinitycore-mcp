  method: SendChatPlayerNotfoundNotice
  signature: void WorldSession::SendChatPlayerNotfoundNotice(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message to the player indicating that the specified target player
    could not be found.
  description: The SendChatPlayerNotfoundNotice method is used by the WorldSession
    class to notify a player in chat when they attempt to send a private message to
    a player who is either offline, does not exist, or is otherwise unreachable. This
    method constructs and sends an appropriate error message to the session's associated
    client, informing the user that their target player could not be located. The
    method is typically invoked as part of the chat system's validation logic when
    processing private messages or whispers. It ensures proper feedback to the user
    without causing errors in the client-side chat interface.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The username of the player that was not found. This string represents
      the target player's name as entered by the sender in the whisper command.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a player not found notice
    code: "void HandleWhisperCommand(WorldSession* session, const std::string& targetName)\n\
      {\n    if (!IsPlayerOnline(targetName))\n    {\n        session->SendChatPlayerNotfoundNotice(targetName);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with sending the whisper...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the chat system's error handling and should only be
    called when a player cannot be located. It directly interacts with the client's
    chat interface to display an appropriate message. The implementation assumes that
    the session is valid and connected.
