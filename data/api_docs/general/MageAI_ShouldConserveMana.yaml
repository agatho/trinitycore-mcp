  signature: bool MageAI::ShouldConserveMana()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Mage AI should conserve mana during spell casting.
  description: The ShouldConserveMana method evaluates the current mana level and
    spell casting conditions to decide if the Mage AI should prioritize mana conservation.
    This is typically used to determine when to avoid casting high-mana spells or
    to switch to lower-cost alternatives. The method considers factors such as available
    mana percentage, current combat state, and spell priorities set by the AI logic.
    It returns true when mana conservation is advised, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI should conserve mana (e.g., low mana, non-essential
    spells), false if mana conservation is not necessary or beneficial at this time.

    code: "if (mageAI->ShouldConserveMana()) {\n    // Switch to low-mana spell or\
      \ wait\n    ai->SetNextSpell(MAGE_SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n} else {\n    // Cast\
      \ high-damage spell\n    ai->SetNextSpell(MAGE_SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Mage AI's resource management system and should
    be called regularly during combat to make informed decisions about spell usage.
    It may be influenced by external factors such as player level, gear, and current
    spell cooldowns.
