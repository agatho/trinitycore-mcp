documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic cycling of transport stop frames.
  description: The SetTransportAutoCycleBetweenStopFrames method controls whether
    a transport vehicle automatically cycles through its defined stop frames when
    moving between waypoints. When enabled, the transport will smoothly transition
    between stop positions without manual intervention. This is commonly used for
    ships, zeppelins, and other large transports that need to animate their movement
    across multiple stops. The method affects the internal state of the transport
    object and modifies how it handles waypoint progression and animation timing.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Cycle for Transport
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...;

      transport->SetTransportAutoCycleBetweenStopFrames(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Cycle for Transport
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...;

      transport->SetTransportAutoCycleBetweenStopFrames(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during transport initialization or configuration.
    It's important to note that enabling auto-cycle will override any manual stop
    frame control, potentially conflicting with custom movement logic. The effect
    is immediate and applies to all subsequent waypoint transitions.
  warnings: Setting this to true on a transport with complex custom movement patterns
    may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that the transport's stop frames are properly
    configured before enabling auto-cycle, as misconfigured stops can lead to visual
    glitches or incorrect positioning during travel.
