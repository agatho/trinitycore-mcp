  class: SpellHistory
  method: GetChargeRecoveryTime
  signature: int SpellHistory::GetChargeRecoveryTime(int chargeCategoryId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the recovery time for a spell charge category.
  description: The GetChargeRecoveryTime method returns the time in milliseconds that
    must pass before a spell charge associated with the specified charge category
    can be recovered. This is used in conjunction with spell charges, which allow
    players or creatures to use a spell multiple times before needing to wait for
    cooldowns to expire. The method looks up the recovery time based on the provided
    charge category ID, which typically corresponds to a specific set of charges for
    a given ability or talent. If no recovery time is defined for the specified category,
    it may return 0 or a default value depending on implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: chargeCategoryId
    description: An integer identifier representing the spell charge category. This
      ID maps to a specific set of charges that share the same cooldown behavior.
      Valid values are typically defined in spell charge category tables within the
      game's database or configuration files.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the recovery time in milliseconds
    for the specified charge category. A return value of 0 usually indicates no recovery
    time is required, or that the category ID was not found.
  examples:
  - title: Check Recovery Time for a Charge Category
    code: "int recoveryTime = spellHistory->GetChargeRecoveryTime(12345);\nif (recoveryTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply cooldown logic\n    std::cout << \"Recovery time: \"\
      \ << recoveryTime << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use with Spell Charge Management
    code: "void OnSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    int categoryId = spell->GetChargeCategoryId();\n\
      \    int recoveryTime = spellHistory->GetChargeRecoveryTime(categoryId);\n \
      \   if (recoveryTime > 0)\n    {\n        // Set up a cooldown timer for the\
      \ charge category\n        spellHistory->SetChargeRecoveryTime(categoryId, recoveryTime);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with spell charge systems where
    abilities can be used multiple times before entering a cooldown. The charge category
    ID should match entries defined in the game's spell charge data tables to ensure
    correct behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided chargeCategoryId corresponds to an actual defined
    charge category, as invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    recovery times. This method does not validate input parameters and assumes valid
    data is passed.
