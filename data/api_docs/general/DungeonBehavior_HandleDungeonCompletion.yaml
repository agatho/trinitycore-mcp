documentation:
  brief: Handles the completion of a dungeon by a group, processing rewards and cleanup.
  description: The HandleDungeonCompletion method is responsible for managing the
    end-of-dungeon process for a group that has successfully completed a dungeon instance.
    This includes distributing loot, awarding experience points, updating quest progress,
    and performing any necessary cleanup operations such as removing temporary buffs
    or resetting player states. The method ensures that all group members receive
    appropriate rewards based on their participation in the dungeon run and handles
    the transition of players back to normal gameplay state. It is typically invoked
    when a dungeon's objectives are met and the group has defeated all required bosses
    or completed the necessary challenges.

  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Completion Handler
    code: "void DungeonManager::OnDungeonComplete(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group)\n\
      \    {\n        dungeonBehavior->HandleDungeonCompletion(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been validated for completion
    status and that all necessary conditions for dungeon completion have been met.
    The method may internally call other subsystems such as loot distribution, experience
    calculation, and quest update systems. It's important to ensure that the Group
    pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the group has actually completed
    the dungeon can result in incorrect reward distribution or game state corruption.
    The method does not perform validation of group member status, so it should only
    be called after confirming all players are eligible for rewards.
