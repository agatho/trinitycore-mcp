  brief: Copies the configuration and settings from another BotAIFactory instance
  description: The BotAIFactory constructor is used to create a new instance of the
    BotAIFactory class by copying all configuration parameters and settings from an
    existing BotAIFactory object. This allows for the duplication of AI factory configurations,
    which is essential when creating multiple bot instances with identical behavior
    patterns. The copied settings typically include AI decision-making parameters,
    behavior profiles, and other configuration data that define how bots will act
    within the World of Warcraft environment. This constructor ensures consistency
    in bot behavior across different instances while maintaining the flexibility to
    customize individual bot behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotAIFactory by copying an existing one
    code: 'BotAIFactory originalFactory;

      // Configure originalFactory with desired AI settings

      BotAIFactory newFactory(originalFactory); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, so it performs a deep copy of all internal configuration
    data. The copied factory will maintain identical behavior patterns to the source
    factory at the time of copying, but subsequent modifications to either factory
    will not affect the other.
  warnings: Be aware that this constructor creates a shallow copy of the underlying
    data structures. If any of the configuration objects are pointers, they may point
    to the same memory locations in both instances, potentially causing unexpected
    behavior if one instance modifies shared data.
