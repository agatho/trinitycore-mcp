  brief: Clears all arcane charges from the tracker
  description: The ClearCharges method removes all arcane charges currently stored
    in the ArcaneChargeTracker instance. This method is typically invoked when a player's
    arcane charge state needs to be reset, such as during spell casting, ability usage,
    or when transitioning between different game states. The operation effectively
    sets the internal charge count to zero and may trigger associated events or updates
    to reflect the cleared state. This method does not take any parameters and has
    no return value.
  parameters: []

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it directly affects the arcane
    charge state, which may influence spell behavior or cooldowns. It is recommended
    to verify the current charge state before and after calling this method for debugging
    purposes.
