  signature: void LFGBotManager::OnGroupFormed(int groupGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a new LFG group is formed by the LFGBot system
  description: The OnGroupFormed method is invoked by the LFGBotManager when a new
    Looking For Group (LFG) group has been successfully created and assembled. This
    method processes the formation of the group, potentially updating internal tracking
    structures, notifying other systems about the new group, and performing any necessary
    cleanup or state transitions. The method accepts the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the newly formed group as its parameter, which can be used to retrieve detailed
    information about the group from the game's database or internal data structures.
    This method is typically called as part of the LFG workflow within TrinityCore's
    LFG system and is essential for maintaining synchronization between the bot's
    operations and the core game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the newly formed LFG group. This
      value represents the database identifier for the group object within the TrinityCore
      system, used to reference and manage the group's state, members, and associated
      data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Bot Logic
    code: "void LFGBotManager::OnGroupFormed(int groupGuid)\n{\n    // Log the formation\
      \ of a new group\n    sLog->outString(\"LFGBot: New LFG group formed with GUID\
      \ %d\", groupGuid);\n    \n    // Update internal tracking structures\n    m_groupTracker[groupGuid]\
      \ = GroupState::FORMED;\n    \n    // Notify other systems about the new group\n\
      \    HandleGroupNotification(groupGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Group Data Retrieval
    code: "void LFGBotManager::OnGroupFormed(int groupGuid)\n{\n    // Retrieve group\
      \ information from database\n    Group* group = sObjectMgr->GetGroupByGUID(groupGuid);\n\
      \    if (!group)\n        return;\n    \n    // Process each member of the group\n\
      \    for (GroupReference* ref = group->GetFirstMember(); ref; ref = ref->next())\n\
      \    {\n        Player* player = ref->getSource();\n        if (player)\n  \
      \      {\n            // Update player's LFG status\n            player->SetLfgState(LFG_STATE_DONE);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n    \n    // Mark group as completed in bot tracking\n  \
      \  m_activeGroups.erase(groupGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the LFG subsystem of TrinityCore
    and should be implemented to handle asynchronous group formation events. The method
    does not directly modify the group object itself but rather responds to its creation,
    making it suitable for post-processing actions such as logging, state updates,
    or notifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupGuid parameter is valid before attempting to access
    group data, as invalid GUIDs may cause crashes or undefined behavior. The method
    should not perform heavy operations that could block the main game thread, as
    it's likely called during critical LFG workflow phases.
