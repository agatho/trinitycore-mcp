  method: PreprocessSpellLaunch
  signature: void Spell::PreprocessSpellLaunch(TargetInfo & targetInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and prepares spell launch data for execution based on target
    information.
  description: The PreprocessSpellLaunch method is responsible for setting up internal
    spell state and validating target data before a spell is actually cast. It processes
    the provided TargetInfo structure to ensure all necessary conditions are met for
    spell execution, including target validity, line of sight checks, and any required
    preprocessing steps. This method typically runs as part of the spell casting pipeline
    in TrinityCore's spell system, ensuring that spells are properly configured before
    being launched. The method does not perform the actual spell effect but prepares
    the environment for it.
  parameters:
  - name: targetInfo
    description: Reference to a TargetInfo structure containing target data and spell
      targeting information. This includes target position, unit reference, and other
      relevant targeting parameters required for spell validation and preparation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Launch Preprocessing
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, true);

      TargetInfo targetInfo;

      targetInfo.target = targetUnit;

      targetInfo.t_pos = targetPosition;

      spell->PreprocessSpellLaunch(targetInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Preprocessing with Target Validation
    code: "if (targetInfo.target && targetInfo.target->IsAlive()) {\n    Spell* spell\
      \ = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, true);\n    spell->PreprocessSpellLaunch(targetInfo);\n\
      \    // Proceed with spell launch\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. It modifies internal spell state and prepares
    data structures needed for spell execution. The method assumes that the TargetInfo
    parameter has been properly initialized with valid target data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of TargetInfo can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required fields in TargetInfo
    are populated before calling this method.
