documentation:
  brief: Removes expired bot world sessions from the session manager.
  description: The CleanupExpiredSessions method iterates through all active bot world
    sessions managed by the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance and removes those
    that have exceeded their configured expiration time. This method is typically
    called periodically by the game server to perform cleanup of stale or inactive
    bot sessions, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing resource leaks. The
    cleanup process checks each session's last activity timestamp against the current
    time and removes sessions that have been inactive beyond the defined threshold.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionManager = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();

      sessionManager->CleanupExpiredSessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the server's maintenance
    routines to prevent accumulation of stale sessions. The expiration time threshold
    is typically configurable and may vary based on bot type or server settings.
