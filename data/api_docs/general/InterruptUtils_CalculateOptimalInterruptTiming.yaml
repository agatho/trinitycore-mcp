  class: InterruptUtils
  method: CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming
  signature: float InterruptUtils::CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming(float totalCastTime,
    float reactionTime, float executionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal timing window for interrupting a spell cast based
    on total cast time, reaction time, and execution time.
  description: The CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming method computes the precise moment
    within a spell's casting process when an interruption should occur to maximize
    effectiveness. This utility is essential for implementing combat mechanics where
    players or NPCs must time their interrupts accurately. The calculation considers
    the total duration of the cast, the reaction delay before the interrupt can be
    initiated, and the execution time required to perform the interrupt action itself.
    The result represents a normalized timing value that can be used by AI systems
    or player input handlers to determine when an interrupt should be triggered for
    maximum efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: totalCastTime
    description: The total duration (in seconds) of the spell being interrupted. Must
      be a positive float value representing the complete casting time of the target
      spell.
  - name: reactionTime
    description: The delay (in seconds) between when an interrupt is detected and
      when it can be executed. This accounts for processing delays and player reaction
      time, must be non-negative.
  - name: executionTime
    description: The time (in seconds) required to perform the interrupt action itself.
      Should be a non-negative float representing the duration of the interrupt animation
      or action sequence.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal timing window for interrupting
    a spell cast, expressed as a normalized percentage (0.0 to 1.0) of the total cast
    time. A value of 0.0 indicates immediate interruption at the start of the cast,
    while 1.0 indicates interruption at the very end. Values between these extremes
    represent intermediate timing points optimized for maximum effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Timing Calculation
    code: 'float optimalTiming = InterruptUtils::CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming(3.0f,
      0.2f, 0.1f);

      // Returns approximately 0.75, indicating interrupt should occur at 75% through
      the cast'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt Timing for Different Spell Types
    code: 'float longCastTiming = InterruptUtils::CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming(5.0f,
      0.3f, 0.2f);

      float shortCastTiming = InterruptUtils::CalculateOptimalInterruptTiming(1.5f,
      0.1f, 0.05f);

      // longCastTiming returns ~0.85, shortCastTiming returns ~0.75'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes linear casting behavior and does not account for spell
    mechanics such as channeling, instant casts, or partial interruption effects.
    The calculation is optimized for single-target interrupt scenarios and may require
    modification for complex combat situations involving multiple simultaneous interrupts
    or special abilities with unique timing requirements.
  warnings: The return value represents an idealized timing that assumes perfect execution
    of all components. In practice, real-world usage should account for additional
    factors like network latency, player input delays, and combat system variations.
    Using this method without proper validation may lead to unrealistic interrupt
    behavior in gameplay scenarios.
