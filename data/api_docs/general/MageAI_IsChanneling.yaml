  signature: bool MageAI::IsChanneling()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Mage AI is currently channeling a spell.
  description: The IsChanneling method determines whether the mage AI character is
    currently engaged in channeling a spell. This method is typically used within
    the AI logic to prevent certain actions or behaviors while a spell is being channeled,
    such as casting other spells or moving. It returns true if the mage is actively
    channeling and false otherwise. The implementation likely checks internal state
    flags or spell casting information to determine this condition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI is currently channeling a spell, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (ai->IsChanneling()) {\n    // Do not interrupt current channeling\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal AI behavior"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "if (!ai->IsChanneling() && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n \
      \   // Cast a new spell only if not channeling\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the Mage AI implementation to manage spell
    casting behavior and prevent conflicting actions during channeling. It's important
    to note that this check should be performed frequently in the AI update loop to
    ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Be aware that channeling spells may have specific cooldowns or restrictions
    that this method does not directly handle, so additional checks might be needed
    for complex spell management logic.
