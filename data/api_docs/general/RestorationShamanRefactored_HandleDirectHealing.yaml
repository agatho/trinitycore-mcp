  signature: bool RestorationShamanRefactored::HandleDirectHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs direct healing on a specified group member using restoration shaman
    abilities
  description: The HandleDirectHealing method executes a direct healing action targeting
    a group member within the shaman's range. This method is part of the RestorationShamanRefactored
    class and implements core healing mechanics for restoration shamans in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. It evaluates whether the target is valid,
    checks resource availability (such as mana), and applies the appropriate healing
    effect. The method returns true if the healing was successfully applied, or false
    if the operation failed due to invalid targets, insufficient resources, or other
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group index identifier specifying which group member to heal.
      Valid values are typically integers representing group positions (0-23) or specific
      target identifiers within the player's current group context.
  returns: Returns true if the direct healing was successfully executed on the specified
    group member, otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid target,
    insufficient mana, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Usage
    code: "if (shaman->HandleDirectHealing(0)) {\n    // Healing was successful\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Direct healing applied to group member 0\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Healing failed\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to apply direct healing\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Healing with Resource Check
    code: "Player* target = player->GetGroup()->GetMember(2);\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    if (shaman->HandleDirectHealing(2)) {\n        // Healing applied successfully\n\
      \        player->AddItem(ItemTemplate::CreateItem(12345), 1); // Example reward\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat or when the shaman has sufficient
    mana to perform healing actions. The group parameter should be validated before
    calling this method to ensure it refers to a valid group member within the player's
    current group context. Performance considerations include checking target validity
    and resource availability before attempting healing.
  warnings: Ensure that the group index passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    group member, as invalid indices may cause undefined behavior or crashes. The
    method does not perform automatic mana checks beyond basic validation; it assumes
    sufficient resources are available for successful execution.
