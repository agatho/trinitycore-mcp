  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetAutoTauntEnabled
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetAutoTauntEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auto-taunt functionality for the threat coordinator.
  description: The SetAutoTauntEnabled method controls whether the ThreatCoordinator
    automatically applies taunt effects to target units when certain conditions are
    met. This functionality is typically used in AI behavior scripting to manage how
    mobs acquire and maintain aggro. When enabled, the system will automatically taunt
    targets based on configured threat rules; when disabled, manual taunt control
    is required. The method does not validate the current state of the coordinator
    before applying the setting.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether auto-taunt should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Taunt
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = unit->GetThreatCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetAutoTauntEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Taunt Conditionally
    code: "if (someCondition)\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = unit->GetThreatCoordinator();\n\
      \    coordinator->SetAutoTauntEnabled(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator
    without triggering any additional events or callbacks. It is recommended to call
    this method during initialization or when transitioning between different AI states
    rather than in high-frequency update loops.
  warnings: Changing auto-taunt settings while combat is active may cause unexpected
    behavior in threat management. Ensure that all related threat calculations are
    properly synchronized after modifying this setting.
