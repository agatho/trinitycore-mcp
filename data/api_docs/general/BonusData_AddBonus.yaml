  class: BonusData
  method: AddBonus
  signature: void BonusData::AddBonus(uint32 type, const std::array<int32, 4> & values)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a bonus of the specified type with the given values to the bonus data
    container.
  description: The AddBonus method is used to register a new bonus entry within the
    BonusData class. It takes a bonus type identifier and an array of four integer
    values that define the properties or effects of the bonus. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage various game bonuses
    such as stat modifications, damage multipliers, or other gameplay effects. The
    bonus data is stored internally for later application to player characters or
    game objects. No explicit validation is performed on the input values, so it is
    up to the caller to ensure that the provided values are meaningful and within
    expected ranges.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: A unique identifier representing the type of bonus being added. This
      value determines how the bonus will be interpreted and applied in game logic.
  - name: values
    description: An array containing exactly four signed 32-bit integers that define
      the properties or effects of the bonus. The meaning of these values depends
      on the bonus type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Stat Bonus
    code: 'BonusData bonusData;

      std::array<int32, 4> statValues = {10, 5, 0, 0};

      bonusData.AddBonus(1, statValues); // Adds a bonus with type 1 and values [10,
      5, 0, 0]'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a Damage Multiplier Bonus
    code: 'BonusData bonusData;

      std::array<int32, 4> damageValues = {0, 0, 150, 0};

      bonusData.AddBonus(2, damageValues); // Adds a damage multiplier bonus with
      type 2 and values [0, 0, 150, 0]'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the BonusData object. It is important
    to understand that bonuses are typically applied during gameplay calculations
    and may be subject to stacking rules or other game mechanics. The exact interpretation
    of the four values in the array depends on the bonus type and how it's handled
    by the game engine.
  warnings: The method does not validate the input parameters, so passing invalid
    or out-of-range values for 'type' or 'values' may lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors during bonus application. Ensure that bonus types are properly defined
    in the game's configuration before calling this method.
