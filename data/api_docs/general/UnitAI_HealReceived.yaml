  class: UnitAI
  method: HealReceived
  signature: void UnitAI::HealReceived(Unit * param0, uint32 & param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles incoming heal events for a unit, updating health and related AI states.
  description: The HealReceived method is invoked when a unit receives healing from
    another source. This method updates the unit's current health value and may trigger
    AI behavior changes such as recalculating threat or adjusting combat stance. It
    serves as a core part of the unit's AI response to healing actions, ensuring proper
    state management within the game's combat system. The method typically operates
    during the execution of heal spells or effects that directly affect the unit's
    health pool.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is receiving the heal. This represents
      the target unit whose health will be modified.
  - name: param1
    description: Reference to a uint32 value representing the amount of healing received.
      The value may be modified by this method to reflect actual healed amount after
      any calculations or adjustments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic HealReceived Usage
    code: "void MyUnitAI::HealReceived(Unit* healer, uint32& healAmount)\n{\n    //\
      \ Update unit's health\n    if (healAmount > 0)\n    {\n        GetUnit()->ModifyHealth(healAmount);\n\
      \        // Trigger any AI logic based on healing received\n        HandleHealingReceived();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a heal spell or effect is processed. Developers should ensure that any custom
    implementation properly handles potential overflow or underflow of health values.
    The reference parameter 'param1' allows for modification of the healing amount,
    which can be useful for implementing scaling effects or diminishing returns.
  warnings: Improper handling of the heal amount may lead to incorrect health calculations
    or AI behavior anomalies. Ensure that any modifications to the healAmount parameter
    are consistent with game balance and mechanics. Avoid calling this method directly
    without proper validation of input parameters.
