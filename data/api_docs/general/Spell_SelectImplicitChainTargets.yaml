documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit chain targets for spell effects based on target type and
    spell effect information
  description: This method determines and selects appropriate chain targets for spell
    effects that require chain targeting, using the provided spell effect information
    and target type. It handles the selection of targets based on various criteria
    including proximity, target type, and spell effect parameters. The method is crucial
    for implementing chain-based spell mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly
    for spells like Arcane Missiles or other chain-based damage spells where multiple
    targets are involved.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the specific spell effect being processed,
      including effect type, radius, and other parameters that determine how targets
      are selected
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the target type for the spell effect, which determines how
      targets are chosen based on the spell's implicit targeting rules
  - name: target
    description: The primary target object that serves as the base for chain target
      selection, typically a unit or gameobject that may be used as reference for
      determining chain targets
  - name: effMask
    description: A bitmask representing which spell effects are being processed, allowing
      for selective processing of specific effects within a spell
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chain Target Selection Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitChainTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, target, effMask);

      // This selects chain targets for a spell with multiple effects'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Chain Target Selection Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitChainTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, target, effMask);

      // This handles complex chain targeting for spells like Arcane Missiles

      // where multiple targets are selected based on proximity and target type'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell target selection process and should be called
    during spell execution. It's important to note that this method may be called
    multiple times per spell depending on the number of effects involved. The method
    relies on target type information and spell effect parameters to determine chain
    targets correctly.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may affect spell targeting
    behavior, particularly for spells with multiple effects or chain-based damage.
    Incorrect handling of target selection can lead to improper spell execution or
    targeting issues.
