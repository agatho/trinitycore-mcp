  class: EquipmentManager
  method: LogEquipmentDecision
  signature: void EquipmentManager::LogEquipmentDecision(int * player, const std::string
    & action, const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Logs an equipment decision made by a player, including the action taken and
    reason for the decision.
  description: The LogEquipmentDecision method records information about a player's
    equipment-related actions within the game. This function is typically used to
    track when players equip, unequip, or modify their gear during gameplay. The logged
    data includes the player identifier, the specific action performed (such as 'equip',
    'unequip', or 'swap'), and a reason for the decision. This logging mechanism helps
    in debugging equipment-related issues, tracking player behavior, and maintaining
    game integrity by ensuring proper equipment handling. The method does not return
    any value but writes to internal logs or databases for later analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player ID; otherwise, behavior
      is undefined.
  - name: action
    description: String describing the equipment action performed by the player. Examples
      include 'equip', 'unequip', 'swap', or 'modify'.
  - name: reason
    description: String explaining the reason behind the equipment decision. This
      can be used for debugging, analytics, or game event tracking purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equipment Logging Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      EquipmentManager::LogEquipmentDecision(&playerId, "equip", "Player equipped
      a new weapon");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Logging with Dynamic Reason
    code: 'int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string action = "unequip";

      std::string reason = "Player swapped to off-hand weapon";

      EquipmentManager::LogEquipmentDecision(&playerId, action, reason);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger logging system and may write data
    to a database or log file. It assumes that the player pointer points to a valid
    player object with a valid GUID. The method should be called from within a thread-safe
    context if used in a multi-threaded environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Avoid calling this method with
    null or invalid pointers for the player parameter.
