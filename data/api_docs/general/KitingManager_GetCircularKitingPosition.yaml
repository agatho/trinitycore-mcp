  class: KitingManager
  method: GetCircularKitingPosition
  signature: int KitingManager::GetCircularKitingPosition(Unit * target, float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal circular kiting position relative to a
    target unit based on a specified angle.
  description: The GetCircularKitingPosition method determines the appropriate positional
    coordinates for a unit to maintain circular kiting behavior around a target. This
    is commonly used in AI logic for mobs or players to maintain distance while following
    or attacking targets in a circular pattern. The method takes into account the
    target's position and the desired angle of kiting to compute a suitable location
    that maintains optimal combat positioning. It typically returns an integer value
    representing the calculated position index or status, which may be used by the
    calling function to determine movement or action decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the center point for circular
      kiting. This represents the target unit being kited around.
  - name: angle
    description: The angular offset in radians from the current facing direction of
      the kiting unit. This determines the position along the circular path relative
      to the target.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the result of the calculation. The
    specific meaning may vary depending on implementation but typically represents
    either a valid position index (positive), an error condition (negative), or a
    status flag (zero). A positive return usually indicates success and a usable kiting
    position, while negative values may indicate invalid parameters or failure to
    calculate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating circular kiting position
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nfloat angle = M_PI / 4; // 45 degrees\n\
      int position = kitingManager->GetCircularKitingPosition(target, angle);\nif\
      \ (position > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated position for movement\n    //\
      \ ... movement logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using kiting position in AI behavior
    code: "void AI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        float angle = 0.0f; // Start at current facing\n        int\
      \ pos = kitingManager->GetCircularKitingPosition(target, angle);\n        if\
      \ (pos > 0)\n        {\n            // Move to calculated kiting position\n\
      \            me->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(pos, GetCircularKitingPosition(target,\
      \ angle));\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of an AI system designed for complex movement
    patterns. The implementation likely involves trigonometric calculations to determine
    positions on a circle around the target unit. It's important to ensure that the
    target unit pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing a null pointer
    could lead to undefined behavior. The angle parameter should be in radians and
    may need to be normalized depending on the internal implementation.
  warnings: Passing invalid or null Unit pointers can cause crashes or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the target unit is alive and valid before calling this method.
    The returned integer value should always be checked for validity before using
    it in movement logic, as negative values typically indicate errors or failure
    conditions.
