documentation:
  brief: Determines whether it is safe to spawn new game objects or creatures in the
    current resource context
  description: The IsSpawningSafe method evaluates the current state of the server's
    resource management system to determine if spawning new entities (such as NPCs,
    game objects, or other dynamic elements) is permissible. This check typically
    considers factors like memory usage, CPU load, active connections, and overall
    system health. The method is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to prevent
    resource exhaustion and maintain stable performance during high-traffic periods
    or when the server is under stress. It ensures that spawning operations do not
    overwhelm the system and helps maintain a consistent gaming experience for all
    players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the system is in a safe state for spawning new entities,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that resource constraints
    are too high to safely allow additional spawns at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn logic
    code: "if (ResourceMonitor::Instance()->IsSpawningSafe()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ spawning new creature\n    Creature* creature = me->SummonCreature(NPC_TYPE,\
      \ position);\n} else {\n    // Delay or skip spawning\n    LOG_WARN(\"world\"\
      , \"Skipping spawn due to resource constraints\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting any large-scale spawning
    operations. It's important to note that the safety check may be dynamic and can
    change based on real-time server conditions. The implementation likely uses thresholds
    for memory usage, thread load, and connection count to make its determination.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in performance-critical sections without considering
    caching or batching strategies. Repeated calls during high-frequency operations
    might introduce unnecessary overhead if the underlying system state doesn't change
    frequently.
