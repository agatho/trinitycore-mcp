documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GameEventData class with default values.
  description: The GameEventData constructor initializes a new instance of the GameEventData
    class, setting up internal data structures and default values for event-related
    properties. This method is typically called when creating a new game event object,
    ensuring that all member variables are properly initialized before use. The constructor
    may also perform necessary setup operations such as initializing event state flags,
    setting default time values, or preparing internal containers for event data storage.
    In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this constructor is essential for
    proper object lifecycle management and ensures that game events can be safely
    processed by the server's event handling systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GameEventData instance
    code: 'GameEventData eventData;

      // The eventData object is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be used for game event operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is implicitly called when declaring a GameEventData variable
    without explicit initialization. Developers should be aware that the default initialization
    may not set all fields to meaningful values, and additional setup might be required
    before using the object in event processing scenarios.
