  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetTargetString() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target string identifier for a spell cast.
  description: The GetTargetString method returns an integer identifier representing
    the target type or string associated with a spell cast. This value typically corresponds
    to predefined target types used in spell targeting mechanics within TrinityCore's
    spell system. The returned integer can be used to determine how the spell should
    be processed based on its target context, such as whether it targets an enemy,
    friendly unit, area, or self. This method is commonly used during spell execution
    and validation phases to ensure proper targeting behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the target string identifier for the spell cast.
    The specific value corresponds to predefined target types in the TrinityCore spell
    system, such as TARGET_FLAG_UNIT, TARGET_FLAG_ITEM, or similar constants used
    for spell targeting logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\nint targetString = targets.GetTargetString();\n\
      if (targetString == TARGET_FLAG_UNIT)\n{\n    // Handle unit target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell preparation and execution phases.
    The returned integer value should be compared against predefined constants from
    the TrinityCore target flag system to determine the appropriate targeting behavior.
