documentation:
  brief: Clears all pending database query batches from the QueryBatcher instance.
  description: The ClearBatches method removes all queued database queries that have
    not yet been executed. This function is typically used to reset or clean up the
    batcher state before starting a new set of operations, ensuring no stale or unintended
    queries are processed. It effectively empties the internal queue of pending SQL
    statements without executing them. The method does not perform any database operations
    itself but rather manages the in-memory batch structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Query Batches Before New Operation
    code: 'QueryBatcher batcher;

      // ... add some queries to batcher ...

      batcher.ClearBatches(); // Reset the batcher for new queries'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during cleanup routines or when switching
    between different database operation contexts. It's important to ensure no active
    transactions are in progress before calling this method, as it may invalidate
    pending operations.
