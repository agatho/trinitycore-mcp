  method: GetMeleeRange
  signature: float Unit::GetMeleeRange(const Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the melee range to a target unit.
  description: The GetMeleeRange method computes the distance between the current
    unit and a specified target unit for melee combat purposes. This distance is used
    in various game mechanics including determining if a target is within melee range,
    calculating attack probabilities, and handling combat interactions. The method
    accounts for the target's size and position, returning a float value representing
    the distance in yards. This function is essential for determining whether a unit
    can perform melee attacks on another unit based on proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit for which to calculate melee range. Must
      be a valid Unit object, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the distance in yards between this unit
    and the target unit. A value of 0 indicates the target is at the same location
    as this unit. Values greater than 5 indicate the target is beyond melee range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float range = unit->GetMeleeRange(targetUnit);\nif (range <= 5.0f)\n{\n\
      \    // Target is within melee range\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Target is beyond melee\
      \ range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex calculations including target size, position,
    and movement factors. Performance considerations include the use of cached values
    for frequently accessed ranges to avoid repeated computations.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate results if the target unit is not properly
    initialized or if the target's position has changed without updating the range
    calculation. Avoid using this method during combat when position changes occur.
