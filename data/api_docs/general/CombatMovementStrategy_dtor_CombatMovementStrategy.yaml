documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CombatMovementStrategy instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CombatMovementStrategy class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the strategy
    object. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents
    memory leaks when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor plays a critical role in maintaining
    clean state management for combat movement behaviors used by creatures during
    battle scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of CombatMovementStrategy object
    code: 'CombatMovementStrategy* strategy = new CombatMovementStrategy();

      // ... use the strategy ...

      delete strategy; // Triggers ~CombatMovementStrategy()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a CombatMovementStrategy object
    is destroyed, either through explicit deletion or when it goes out of scope. Developers
    should not manually call this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns.
