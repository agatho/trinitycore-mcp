  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ApplyProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ApplyProfile(BehaviorProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified behavior profile to the adaptive behavior manager, updating
    its current state and actions.
  description: The ApplyProfile method updates the AdaptiveBehaviorManager's internal
    state by applying the settings and configurations defined in the provided BehaviorProfile.
    This method is typically used during runtime to dynamically adjust AI behaviors
    based on changing conditions or player interactions. It ensures that all relevant
    AI components are synchronized with the new profile, potentially modifying decision-making
    processes, action priorities, and response mechanisms. The method does not return
    any value but modifies the manager's state directly.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to a BehaviorProfile object containing the desired AI
      configuration settings to be applied to this manager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Application
    code: 'BehaviorProfile myProfile;

      // Configure profile settings...

      adaptiveManager.ApplyProfile(myProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Behavior Switching
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetDifficulty() == DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n{\n    BehaviorProfile\
      \ heroicProfile;\n    // Set heroic-specific behaviors\n    adaptiveManager.ApplyProfile(heroicProfile);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    BehaviorProfile normalProfile;\n    // Set normal difficulty\
      \ behaviors\n    adaptiveManager.ApplyProfile(normalProfile);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided profile is valid and properly initialized.
    It may trigger internal state updates that affect AI decision-making immediately
    upon execution. The manager should be in a consistent state before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling ApplyProfile with an improperly configured or uninitialized BehaviorProfile
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all profile data is correctly
    set up before applying it. This method modifies the manager's internal state directly,
    so any dependent systems must be aware of potential changes.
