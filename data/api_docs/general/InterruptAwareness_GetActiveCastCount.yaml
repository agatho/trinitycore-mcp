  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetActiveCastCount
  signature: size_t InterruptAwareness::GetActiveCastCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of active casts currently in progress for the InterruptAwareness
    instance.
  description: The GetActiveCastCount method retrieves the total count of ongoing
    spell or ability casts associated with the InterruptAwareness object. This is
    typically used in AI systems to determine how many actions are currently being
    executed by a unit, which can influence decision-making logic such as when to
    interrupt or queue new abilities. The method provides a snapshot of the current
    casting state and does not modify any internal state. It's commonly called during
    AI update cycles or event handling to assess the unit's activity level before
    initiating new casts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of active casts currently in progress.
    Returns zero if no casts are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (m_interruptAwareness.GetActiveCastCount()\
      \ == 0)\n        {\n            // No active casts, can safely start a new one\n\
      \            m_unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Casting Based on Active Casts
    code: "void HandleCombat()\n{\n    size_t activeCasts = m_interruptAwareness.GetActiveCastCount();\n\
      \    if (activeCasts < 3)\n    {\n        // Only cast if fewer than 3 spells\
      \ are active\n        m_unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        // Queue the spell or take alternative action\n  \
      \      m_ai->SetNextAction(ACTION_WAIT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a simple accessor that returns an
    internal counter. It's designed to be fast and thread-safe for frequent polling
    in AI update loops. The returned count includes all types of active casts, including
    spells, abilities, and channeled effects.
  warnings: Be aware that the cast count may change between when you query it and
    when you act upon it, especially in multi-threaded environments or during rapid
    AI updates. Always consider race conditions if using this value for critical decision-making
    logic.
