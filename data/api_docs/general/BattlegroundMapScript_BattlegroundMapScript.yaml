  class: BattlegroundMapScript
  method: BattlegroundMapScript
  signature: void BattlegroundMapScript::BattlegroundMapScript(const char * name,
    uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground map script with the specified name and map identifier.
  description: The BattlegroundMapScript constructor initializes a battleground map
    script instance by associating it with a specific map ID and assigning it a descriptive
    name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to register
    battleground-related scripts for maps that support competitive player versus player
    gameplay. The initialization process sets up internal data structures necessary
    for managing battleground states, player entries, and match outcomes. It ensures
    that the script can properly interact with the game's battleground system and
    respond to events such as player joins, starts, and ends of matches.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the name of the battleground
      map script. This name is used for identification and logging purposes within
      the TrinityCore system.
  - name: mapId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific map instance this
      script will manage. The value must correspond to a valid battleground map ID
      defined in the game's map database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Battleground Map Script
    code: BattlegroundMapScript* bgScript = new BattlegroundMapScript("Wintergrasp",
      489);
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a Custom Battleground Script
    code: "class MyCustomBGScript : public BattlegroundMapScript\n{\npublic:\n   \
      \ MyCustomBGScript() : BattlegroundMapScript(\"MyCustomBattleground\", 1234)\
      \ {}\n};\n\n// Usage in initialization code\nMyCustomBGScript* customBg = new\
      \ MyCustomBGScript();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the base class for all battleground map scripts
    in TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that the mapId provided corresponds to
    an actual battleground map defined in the database, otherwise runtime errors may
    occur when attempting to manage players or events on that map.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you are implementing a custom
    battleground script. Instead, use the appropriate factory methods or registration
    mechanisms provided by the TrinityCore framework for proper integration with the
    game's battleground system.
