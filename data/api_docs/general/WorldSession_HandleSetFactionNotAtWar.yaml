documentation:
  brief: Sets a faction as not at war with the player's faction.
  description: The HandleSetFactionNotAtWar method processes a client packet that
    requests to set a specific faction as not at war with the player. This functionality
    allows players to adjust their relationship with various factions in the game,
    potentially enabling peaceful interactions or access to faction-specific content.
    The method typically updates internal faction state tracking within the WorldSession
    and may trigger corresponding updates in the player's faction standing data. It
    is part of the character management system that handles faction-related communications
    between the client and server.

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's ReputationManager to update
    faction standings. It may also trigger UI updates on the client side to reflect
    the new faction status.
