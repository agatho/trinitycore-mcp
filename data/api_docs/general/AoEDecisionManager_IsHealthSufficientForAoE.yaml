    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current health percentage is sufficient to justify
    using an AoE spell or ability.
  description: The IsHealthSufficientForAoE method evaluates whether the average health
    percentage of the unit's group or target area meets a minimum threshold required
    for executing an Area of Effect (AoE) ability. This check helps prevent unnecessary
    use of powerful AoE spells when health levels are too low, ensuring optimal resource
    management and tactical decision-making in combat scenarios. The method typically
    considers the overall health state of the entity and its surroundings to make
    this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the average health percentage is sufficient for using an
    AoE ability; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (aoeDecisionManager.IsHealthSufficientForAoE(50.0f)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with casting AoE spell\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_AOE_DAMAGE);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Switch to single-target strategy\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SINGLE_TARGET_DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used within AI decision trees to dynamically adjust
    spell selection based on current health conditions. It may be influenced by configurable
    thresholds defined in the core or module settings.
