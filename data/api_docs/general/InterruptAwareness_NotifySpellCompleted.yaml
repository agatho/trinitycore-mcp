  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: NotifySpellCompleted
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::NotifySpellCompleted(int casterGuid, uint32
    spellId, bool interrupted)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the interrupt awareness system that a spell has completed or been
    interrupted.
  description: The NotifySpellCompleted method is used to inform the InterruptAwareness
    system about the completion status of a spell cast by a specific caster. This
    method updates internal tracking mechanisms to determine whether certain interrupts
    or awareness states should be triggered based on the spell's outcome. It is typically
    invoked during spell execution logic when a spell finishes its casting process,
    either successfully or due to interruption. The system may use this information
    to manage player awareness, cooldowns, or other gameplay mechanics related to
    spell interruptions.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that cast the spell. This
      is used to track which caster's spell completed or was interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that has completed or been interrupted.
      Used to determine specific behavior based on spell type or effects.
  - name: interrupted
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the spell was interrupted (true)
      or completed successfully (false). This determines how the system processes
      the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: InterruptAwareness::NotifySpellCompleted(playerGuid, 12345, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Interrupted Spell
    code: InterruptAwareness::NotifySpellCompleted(enemyGuid, 67890, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger interrupt awareness system that tracks
    spell casting states and manages related gameplay events. It should be called
    after a spell's execution phase ends to ensure proper state updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the casterGuid and spellId are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior in the interrupt tracking logic.
