  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: ExecuteDirectSQL
  signature: bool PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::ExecuteDirectSQL(const std::string
    & sql)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a direct SQL query against the playerbot character database and
    returns true on success.
  description: The ExecuteDirectSQL method allows executing raw SQL commands directly
    on the playerbot character database. This method is typically used for performing
    database operations that are not covered by higher-level API functions, such as
    custom data modifications or complex queries. The method handles the execution
    of the provided SQL string and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation
    succeeded. It's important to note that this method should be used carefully as
    it bypasses some of the safety mechanisms typically present in higher-level database
    access methods. The SQL command must be properly formatted and valid for the target
    database schema.
  parameters:
  - name: sql
    description: A string containing the complete SQL query to be executed. This should
      be a valid SQL statement such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT. The query
      must be properly escaped and formatted to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  returns: Returns true if the SQL query was executed successfully, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates a database error, invalid SQL syntax,
    or permission issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic SELECT Query
    code: "bool success = playerbotDB->ExecuteDirectSQL(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM playerbots\
      \ WHERE account_id = 12345\");\nif (success)\n{\n    // Query executed successfully\n\
      \    // Process results using appropriate methods\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: INSERT Statement Example
    code: "std::string query = \"INSERT INTO playerbots (account_id, bot_name, level)\
      \ VALUES (12345, 'TestBot', 80);\";\nbool result = playerbotDB->ExecuteDirectSQL(query);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Bot record inserted successfully\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      playerbots\", \"New bot created successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ insertion failure\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to create new\
      \ bot\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates directly on the database connection and should be used
    with caution. Ensure that all SQL queries are properly validated and escaped to
    prevent SQL injection attacks. The method does not automatically handle transaction
    management, so care must be taken when executing multiple related operations.
    This interface is part of the playerbot system's character database access layer.
  warnings: Never pass user input directly into this method without proper sanitization.
    Always validate and escape SQL queries before execution. Be aware that this method
    bypasses some safety checks present in higher-level database APIs, which could
    lead to data corruption or security vulnerabilities if misused.
