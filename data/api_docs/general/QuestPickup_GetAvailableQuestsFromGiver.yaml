  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetAvailableQuestsFromGiver
  signature: int QuestPickup::GetAvailableQuestsFromGiver(uint32 questGiverGuid, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of available quests from a specified quest giver for
    a player bot.
  description: The GetAvailableQuestsFromGiver method determines how many quests are
    currently available from a specific quest giver (identified by GUID) for a given
    player bot. This method is typically used in AI or automation systems within TrinityCore
    to dynamically assess quest availability and guide bot behavior. It evaluates
    the player's quest log, quest status, and quest giver conditions to return a count
    of eligible quests. The method does not modify any game state but provides information
    needed for decision-making in questing scripts or AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver object, such as an
      NPC or GameObject, from which quests are being checked.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for whom quest
      availability is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of available quests that can
    be accepted or interacted with from the specified quest giver. A return value
    of zero indicates no quests are currently available, while a positive integer
    indicates the count of available quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 npcGuid = 12345;\nPlayer* playerBot = ...; // Assume valid player\
      \ pointer\nint questCount = QuestPickup::GetAvailableQuestsFromGiver(npcGuid,\
      \ playerBot);\nif (questCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Logic
    code: "void BotQuestLogic(Player* bot)\n{\n    uint32 questGiverGuid = bot->GetTarget();\n\
      \    if (Creature* questGiver = bot->GetMap()->GetCreature(questGiverGuid))\n\
      \    {\n        int availableQuests = QuestPickup::GetAvailableQuestsFromGiver(questGiverGuid,\
      \ bot);\n        if (availableQuests > 0)\n        {\n            // Bot can\
      \ accept quests from this giver\n            bot->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverQuestList();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the player's quest log,
    quest completion status, and quest requirements. It may also consider faction,
    level restrictions, and other game-specific conditions that determine if a quest
    is available to the player. The method is expected to be lightweight but could
    involve database lookups or complex condition evaluations depending on the implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid GameObject or Creature
    in the current map; otherwise, the behavior may be undefined. Also, make sure
    the bot pointer is valid and not null to avoid runtime errors during execution.
