  method: DeleteRespawnInfo
  signature: void Map::DeleteRespawnInfo(RespawnInfo * info, int dbTrans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes respawn information for a game object or creature from the map's
    internal tracking system.
  description: The DeleteRespawnInfo method is responsible for removing a specific
    respawn entry from the map's tracking mechanism. This function is typically invoked
    when a game object or creature has been successfully spawned and is no longer
    required to be tracked for respawn purposes. The method ensures that the associated
    respawn data is properly cleaned up, preventing memory leaks and maintaining consistency
    in the server's respawn management system. It accepts a pointer to a RespawnInfo
    structure and an optional database transaction parameter to handle persistence
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: Pointer to the RespawnInfo structure that contains the respawn data
      to be deleted. This parameter must not be null, as passing a null pointer would
      result in undefined behavior.
  - name: dbTrans
    description: Optional integer representing the database transaction identifier.
      If provided, this value is used to associate the deletion operation with an
      existing database transaction for consistency. A value of -1 indicates no transaction
      should be used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      RespawnInfo* respawnInfo = new RespawnInfo();

      // ... populate respawnInfo ...

      map->DeleteRespawnInfo(respawnInfo, -1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Database Transaction
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      RespawnInfo* respawnInfo = ...;

      int transactionId = 42;

      map->DeleteRespawnInfo(respawnInfo, transactionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the RespawnInfo object
    is no longer needed. The internal tracking system relies on this function to manage
    memory and ensure that respawn entries are properly removed from the map's data
    structures.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'info' parameter will lead to a crash or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all RespawnInfo objects passed to this method
    have been properly allocated and initialized before calling DeleteRespawnInfo.
