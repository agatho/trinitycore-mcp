documentation:
  brief: Returns the diminishing returns group index for the aura
  description: The GetDiminishGroup method retrieves the specific diminishing returns
    group that this aura belongs to. In World of Warcraft's mechanics, certain auras
    are subject to diminishing returns based on their group classification. This allows
    the game engine to properly apply the diminishing returns system to prevent stacking
    unlimited effects from the same category. The returned integer represents an index
    that maps to a predefined group in the game's configuration, determining how the
    aura interacts with other auras of the same group when multiple instances are
    present.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the diminishing returns group index for this aura.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no diminishing returns application, while positive
    integers map to specific groups such as crowd control effects, magic debuffs,
    or physical debuffs. The exact mapping is defined within the TrinityCore codebase
    and configuration files.
  examples:
  - title: Check Aura Diminishing Group
    code: "UnitAura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int group = aura->GetDiminishGroup();\n\
      \    if (group > 0)\n        sLog->outString(\"Aura belongs to diminishing returns\
      \ group %d\", group);\n    else\n        sLog->outString(\"Aura has no diminishing\
      \ returns applied\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The diminishing returns system is crucial for balancing gameplay mechanics
    and preventing overpowered combinations of effects. This method should be called
    carefully during aura application or removal events, as the group index may affect
    how the aura interacts with other auras in the same category.
  warnings: Do not assume that all auras have diminishing returns applied. Some auras
    may return 0, indicating they are not subject to diminishing returns. Always validate
    the returned value before using it for logic decisions.
