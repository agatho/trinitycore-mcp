documentation:
  brief: Returns the team faction of the player
  description: The GetTeam method retrieves the team faction identifier associated
    with the player, which determines whether the player belongs to the Alliance or
    Horde faction. This value is used internally by the game engine to handle faction-based
    interactions, such as quest rewards, gossip options, and PvP-related mechanics.
    The method returns 0 for Alliance players and 1 for Horde players, corresponding
    to the faction team values used in the game's internal logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer value representing the player''s faction team: 0 for
    Alliance, 1 for Horde. This value is consistent with the internal faction representation
    used by TrinityCore and determines the player''s relationship with faction-based
    content.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int team = player->GetTeam();\nif (team == 0)\n{\n    // Player is on Alliance\
      \ side\n}\nelse if (team == 1)\n{\n    // Player is on Horde side\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations.
    It directly accesses the player's faction information stored in memory, making
    it fast and efficient for use in game logic.
