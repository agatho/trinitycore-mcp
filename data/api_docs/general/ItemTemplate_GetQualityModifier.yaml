  brief: Returns the quality modifier value associated with the item template.
  description: The GetQualityModifier method retrieves a floating-point value that
    represents how the item's quality affects various game mechanics such as stat
    calculations, pricing, or enchantment effectiveness. This modifier is typically
    defined in the item's template data and influences how the item behaves within
    the game world. The returned value may be used by other systems to adjust item
    properties dynamically based on its quality level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the quality modifier for the item template.
    This value is usually positive and can influence stat multipliers or other quality-based
    calculations in TrinityCore's item system.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses data stored in the item template database entry. It
    is safe to call from any thread that has access to the ItemTemplate object, assuming
