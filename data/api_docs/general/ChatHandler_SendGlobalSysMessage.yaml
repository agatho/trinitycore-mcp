documentation:
  brief: Sends a system message to all online players in the game world
  description: The SendGlobalSysMessage method broadcasts a system message to every
    player currently logged into the TrinityCore server. This method is typically
    used for server-wide announcements, maintenance notifications, or important game
    events that require immediate attention from all players. The message is sent
    as a system message type, which usually appears in a distinct color or format
    in the chat window. The method does not return any value and operates synchronously,
    meaning it will block execution until the message has been queued for delivery
    to all connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: str
    description: A null-terminated character string containing the system message
      to be broadcast to all players. The string should not exceed the maximum allowed
      message length for chat systems, and must be properly formatted with appropriate
      escape sequences if special characters are needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendGlobalSysMessage
    code: "void SendMaintenanceNotice() {\n    ChatHandler* handler = new ChatHandler(player);\n\
      \    handler->SendGlobalSysMessage(\"Server will be going down for maintenance\
      \ in 5 minutes.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending formatted announcement with special characters
    code: "void SendEventAnnouncement() {\n    ChatHandler* handler = new ChatHandler(player);\n\
      \    handler->SendGlobalSysMessage(\"[EVENT] New quest available! \\\"The Lost\
      \ Artifact\\\" is now active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the global chat system and bypasses individual player chat
    filters. It's important to note that messages sent via this method are not stored
    in any persistent chat log, and will be lost when the server restarts. The implementation
    may use internal message queuing to ensure delivery across all connected clients
    without blocking the calling thread for extended periods.
  warnings: Using this method excessively can cause performance issues or network
    congestion if too many messages are sent simultaneously. Additionally, sending
    inappropriate content through global system messages may violate server rules
    and could result in administrative action. The string parameter should always
    be validated to prevent buffer overflows or injection attacks.
