documentation:
  brief: Sends spell cast information to nearby players, notifying them of the spell
    being cast.
  description: The SendSpellGo method is responsible for transmitting spell cast data
    to surrounding players in the game world. This method typically occurs when a
    spell is successfully cast and involves sending relevant information about the
    spell's casting process to nearby players who can observe the spell. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between the caster and observers,
    particularly in scenarios involving spell effects, visual effects, or combat mechanics
    where player visibility matters. The method ensures that all players within the
    spell's range receive proper notification of the spell being cast, which is essential
    for game balance and player experience.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a successful spell cast to ensure proper
    synchronization with nearby players. It typically involves sending packet data
    to the client, and performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls
    when no players are within range.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may result in missing or incorrect spell
    notifications for players, potentially affecting gameplay balance and player experience.
    Ensure that the spell has been properly initialized before calling this method.
