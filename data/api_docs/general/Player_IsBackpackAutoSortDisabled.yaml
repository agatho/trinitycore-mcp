  class: Player
  method: IsBackpackAutoSortDisabled
  signature: bool Player::IsBackpackAutoSortDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether backpack auto-sorting is disabled for the player.
  description: This method checks if the player's backpack auto-sorting functionality
    has been disabled. It returns true when the auto-sort feature is turned off, and
    false when it is enabled. This setting affects how items are automatically sorted
    in the player's backpack, particularly when items are picked up or moved between
    inventory slots. The method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine if
    automatic sorting behavior should be bypassed for specific players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if backpack auto-sorting is disabled, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the player's backpack sorting behavior has been overridden by
    a setting or condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsBackpackAutoSortDisabled()) {\n    // Do not auto-sort items\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to determine player behavior. It may be affected by game settings or player
    preferences, and should be checked before applying sorting logic.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect item pickup mechanics; it only affects
    the auto-sorting behavior of items within the backpack. Be cautious when using
    this in conjunction with other inventory methods to avoid unexpected behavior.
