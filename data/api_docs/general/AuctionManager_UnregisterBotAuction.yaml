  signature: void AuctionManager::UnregisterBotAuction(Player * bot, uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot's auction from the auction house system.
  description: The UnregisterBotAuction method is responsible for removing a specific
    auction created by a bot player from the auction house system. This method ensures
    that the auction is properly cleaned up and no longer visible to other players.
    It typically involves removing the auction entry from internal data structures
    and potentially updating related database records. The method operates on a per-auction
    basis, identified by its unique auction ID, and requires a valid bot player reference
    to perform the cleanup operation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose auction is
      being unregistered. Must be a valid player instance that has created an auction.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction to be unregistered. This ID must
      correspond to an existing auction created by the specified bot player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance

      uint32 auctionId = 12345;

      AuctionManager::UnregisterBotAuction(myBot, auctionId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Unregistration
    code: "if (bot && auctionId > 0)\n{\n    AuctionManager::UnregisterBotAuction(bot,\
      \ auctionId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid parameters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the auction is no longer needed or
    has been successfully processed. The method assumes that the provided auction
    ID is valid and corresponds to an auction owned by the specified bot. It's recommended
    to verify the auction exists before calling this method to prevent potential errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid auction ID or a bot player who did
    not create the auction may lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies.
    Ensure proper validation of inputs before invoking this method.
