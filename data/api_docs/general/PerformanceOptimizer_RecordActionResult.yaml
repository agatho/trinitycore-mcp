  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: RecordActionResult
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::RecordActionResult(uint32_t botGuid, const
    std::string & action, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records the outcome of a bot action for performance monitoring and analysis.
  description: The RecordActionResult method logs the result of a specific action
    performed by a bot, including whether the action succeeded or failed. This functionality
    is used within the TrinityCore framework to track bot behavior and performance
    metrics. The method stores this information using the bot's unique identifier
    (GUID), the action name, and the success status. It serves as part of a larger
    performance optimization system that helps developers understand how bots interact
    with the game world and identify potential issues or bottlenecks in AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot performing the action. This
      value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing a valid game object
      GUID.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action that was performed by the bot. This
      should be a meaningful identifier for the specific operation being tracked,
      such as 'MoveToTarget' or 'CastSpell'.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the action completed successfully
      (true) or failed (false). This determines how the result is categorized in performance
      tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: PerformanceOptimizer::RecordActionResult(12345, "MoveToTarget", true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Action
    code: PerformanceOptimizer::RecordActionResult(67890, "CastSpell", false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other performance tracking
    mechanisms to build comprehensive analytics about bot behavior. The implementation
    may involve thread-safe storage or logging systems to ensure data integrity when
    multiple bots are active simultaneously.
