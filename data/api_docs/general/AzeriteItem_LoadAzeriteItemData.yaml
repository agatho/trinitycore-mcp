  class: AzeriteItem
  method: LoadAzeriteItemData
  signature: void AzeriteItem::LoadAzeriteItemData(const int * owner, int & azeriteItem)
documentation:
  brief: Loads Azerite item data into the specified AzeriteItem object.
  description: The LoadAzeriteItemData method initializes and populates an AzeriteItem
    object with data from a given source, typically associated with a player's equipped
    Azerite item. This method is responsible for setting up internal structures and
    properties required to manage Azerite powers, levels, and other related mechanics.
    It ensures that the Azerite item's state is correctly synchronized with the game's
    data model, allowing for proper interaction with Azerite-related systems such
    as upgrading, unlocking, and applying Azerite powers. The method expects valid
    input parameters representing the owner of the item and a reference to an Azerite
    item identifier.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the GUID or identifier of the
      player who owns the Azerite item. Must be a valid pointer to an integer value.
  - name: azeriteItem
    description: Reference to an integer that represents the Azerite item's unique
      identifier within the game context. This parameter is modified by the method
      to reflect loaded data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of LoadAzeriteItemData
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      int azeriteItemId = 12345;

      AzeriteItem azeriteItem;

      azeriteItem.LoadAzeriteItemData(&playerId, azeriteItemId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or when an Azerite item
    is equipped. It may perform database lookups or internal data synchronization
    depending on the implementation. Ensure that the owner GUID and azeriteItem ID
    are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling LoadAzeriteItemData with invalid or null pointers for 'owner'
    can lead to crashes or memory corruption. Always validate inputs prior to invoking
    this method.
