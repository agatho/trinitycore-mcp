  class: PhaseShift
  method: GetPersonalGuid
  signature: int PhaseShift::GetPersonalGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the personal GUID associated with the PhaseShift object
  description: The GetPersonalGuid method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) that
    represents the player or entity associated with this PhaseShift instance. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, PhaseShift is used to manage phase-based
    visibility and interaction mechanics for players and objects. This GUID specifically
    identifies the individual whose phase settings are being managed by this instance.
    The method is typically used when determining which player's phase restrictions
    should be applied or when checking the ownership of a specific phase shift context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the player or entity associated
    with this PhaseShift instance. This GUID uniquely identifies the individual whose
    phase settings are managed by this object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Player GUID
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      uint32 playerId = phaseShift.GetPersonalGuid();

      // Use playerId for further operations like checking phase restrictions

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages game phases and
    visibility. The returned GUID should be used in conjunction with other TrinityCore
    APIs to properly handle phase-based interactions and object visibility.
