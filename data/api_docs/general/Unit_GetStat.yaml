  brief: Returns the base stat value for a specified stat type
  description: The GetStat method retrieves the base stat value for a given stat type
    from a Unit object. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    to access character stats such as strength, agility, stamina, intellect, and spirit.
    The stat parameter represents the index of the stat being queried, with values
    typically ranging from 0 to 4 for the main stats (Strength, Agility, Stamina,
    Intellect, Spirit). This method provides access to base stat values before any
    modifiers or buffs are applied, making it useful for calculating total stats or
    understanding character progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the base stat amount for the specified
    stat type. The value is typically an integer but converted to float for compatibility
    with other stat calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      float strength = target->GetStat(0);

      float agility = target->GetStat(1);

      float stamina = target->GetStat(2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully as it
    may not include modifiers from buffs or gear. The stat index corresponds to the
    standard stat types in World of Warcraft, with 0 being Strength, 1 being Agility,
    2 being Stamina, 3 being Intellect, and 4 being Spirit.
  warnings: This method does not account for temporary stat modifiers or buffs that
    may be applied to a unit. Developers should ensure they understand the difference
    between base stats and total stats when using this method.
