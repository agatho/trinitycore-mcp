  method: GetZone
  signature: uint32 Weather::GetZone() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the zone identifier associated with this weather instance
  description: The GetZone method retrieves the unique zone identifier that the weather
    instance is currently affecting. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    weather systems are tied to specific zones rather than global world states. This
    allows for localized weather effects such as rain, snow, or storms that only impact
    players within a particular zone. The returned zone ID corresponds to the ZoneDBC
    entry and can be used to determine which area of the game world is experiencing
    the specified weather conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the zone identifier (ZoneID) that this weather
    instance affects. This ID maps directly to the ZoneDBC database entries and uniquely
    identifies a specific zone or area within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check affected zone
    code: 'Weather* weather = player->GetMap()->GetWeather();

      uint32 zoneId = weather->GetZone();

      TC_LOG_INFO("weather", "Current weather affects zone ID: %u", zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using zone ID to determine weather effects for area
    code: "Weather* weather = player->GetMap()->GetWeather();\nuint32 zoneId = weather->GetZone();\n\
      if (zoneId == 141) // Eastern Kingdoms - Elwynn Forest\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      weather\", \"Player is in Elwynn Forest, experiencing %s\", weather->GetWeatherTypeString());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Weather object has been properly initialized
    with a valid zone. The zone ID returned should match entries in the ZoneDBC database.
    This method is typically called during weather update cycles or when checking
    current environmental conditions for player feedback.
  warnings: The method returns an uninitialized value if called on a Weather object
    that hasn't been properly configured with a zone. Always verify that the Weather
    instance exists and has valid data before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
