  class: TargetSelectionUtils
  method: GetInterruptTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetSelectionUtils::GetInterruptTarget(Player * bot, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the highest-priority target unit that can be interrupted
    within the specified range for a bot player.
  description: The GetInterruptTarget method identifies the most suitable unit to
    interrupt based on predefined criteria such as threat level, distance, and spell
    casting status. It is primarily used in AI logic for bot players to determine
    which enemy should be targeted for interrupting their spells. The method evaluates
    all valid targets within the given maximum range and selects the one with the
    highest priority according to internal selection rules. This function plays a
    crucial role in combat decision-making for automated players, ensuring that high-priority
    spellcasters are interrupted first to prevent damaging abilities from completing.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      the interrupt action. Must be a valid player instance with AI capabilities enabled.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which potential interrupt targets
      are considered. Targets beyond this range will be ignored during selection.
  returns: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the selected target for interruption,
    or nullptr if no valid target is found within the specified range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI
    code: "Unit* target = TargetSelectionUtils::GetInterruptTarget(botPlayer, 30.0f);\n\
      if (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the target's\
      \ spell\n    botPlayer->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using interrupt target in a combat routine
    code: "float maxInterruptRange = 25.0f;\nUnit* interruptTarget = TargetSelectionUtils::GetInterruptTarget(playerBot,\
      \ maxInterruptRange);\nif (interruptTarget != nullptr) {\n    // Check if the\
      \ target is casting a spell\n    if (interruptTarget->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n        // Attempt to interrupt the spell\n        playerBot->CastSpell(interruptTarget,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal target selection logic that considers factors
    like threat level, unit state, and spell casting status. The returned Unit pointer
    is valid only while the target remains in the world and has not been destroyed
    or removed from combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player passed to this function is properly initialized
    and has AI behavior enabled. Failure to do so may result in incorrect targeting
    or crashes when accessing the unit's spell casting state.
