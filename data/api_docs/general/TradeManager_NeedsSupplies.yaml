  method: NeedsSupplies
  signature: bool TradeManager::NeedsSupplies() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the trade manager requires additional supplies for processing
    trades.
  description: The NeedsSupplies method checks if the trade manager has sufficient
    resources or supplies to handle ongoing trade operations. This typically involves
    verifying that necessary items, currency, or other trade-related assets are available
    in the system. The method is commonly used during trade validation to ensure that
    all required components for a trade transaction are present before proceeding.
    It may also be called as part of automated systems that monitor and manage trade
    inventory levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade manager requires additional supplies or resources
    to process trades, false otherwise. This indicates whether trade operations might
    be blocked due to insufficient inventory or other supply constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.NeedsSupplies()) {\n    // Handle supply shortage\n  \
      \  LOG_ERROR(\"trade\", \"Trade manager requires additional supplies\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Trade Validation
    code: "bool canProceed = !tradeManager.NeedsSupplies();\nif (!canProceed) {\n\
      \    // Prevent trade from proceeding\n    player->SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_BUSY);\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with trade logic\n    tradeManager.ProcessTrade();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with inventory management systems
    to maintain proper trade flow. It may be called frequently during trade operations,
    so performance optimization is recommended for high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the trade manager's supply state is properly synchronized
    across threads if used in multi-threaded environments. Failure to do so may result
    in inconsistent trade processing behavior.
