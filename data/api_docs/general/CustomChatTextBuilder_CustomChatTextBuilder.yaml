  class: CustomChatTextBuilder
  method: CustomChatTextBuilder
  signature: void CustomChatTextBuilder::CustomChatTextBuilder(const WorldObject *
    obj, int msgType, std::string_view text, int language, const WorldObject * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a custom chat text builder with specified object, message type,
    text, language, and target.
  description: The CustomChatTextBuilder constructor initializes a chat text builder
    instance for generating custom chat messages in World of Warcraft. It sets up
    internal state based on the provided parameters including the source object, message
    type (such as whisper, say, or yell), the actual text content, language identifier,
    and optional target object. This method is typically used when creating custom
    in-game communication systems or modifying how chat messages are processed and
    displayed to players. The builder prepares the necessary data structures for subsequent
    operations like formatting, validation, or sending the constructed message.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is the source of the chat message.
      This could be a Player, Creature, GameObject, or any other object capable of
      sending chat messages.
  - name: msgType
    description: Integer representing the type of chat message being constructed.
      Common values include CHAT_MSG_SAY (0), CHAT_MSG_YELL (1), CHAT_MSG_WHISPER
      (2), etc., as defined in the TrinityCore chat system.
  - name: text
    description: String view containing the actual text content of the chat message
      to be built. This is the core message body that will be sent or displayed.
  - name: language
    description: Integer identifier for the language used in the message. This corresponds
      to Language constants defined in the TrinityCore system, such as LANG_UNIVERSAL
      (0), LANG_ORCISH (1), etc.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is the intended recipient of the
      chat message. For whispers or private messages, this would be the target player;
      for public messages, it may be null.
  returns: None. This is a constructor method and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of CustomChatTextBuilder
    code: 'CustomChatTextBuilder builder(player, CHAT_MSG_SAY, "Hello everyone!",
      LANG_UNIVERSAL, nullptr);

      // The builder is now initialized with the specified parameters for further
      processing.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Whisper Message
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is obtained from somewhere

      CustomChatTextBuilder whisperBuilder(player, CHAT_MSG_WHISPER, "This is a secret
      message.", LANG_UNIVERSAL, targetPlayer);

      // Builds a whisper message directed at the specific player.'
    language: cpp
  notes: The CustomChatTextBuilder class likely handles internal formatting and validation
    of chat messages before they are sent to clients. It's important to ensure that
    all parameters passed to this constructor are valid, especially the obj and target
    pointers, which should not be null unless explicitly allowed by the implementation.
    The language parameter must correspond to a supported language in the game.
  warnings: Ensure that the obj pointer is valid and points to an actual WorldObject
    before calling this constructor. Passing invalid or dangling pointers can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious with the msgType parameter
    - incorrect values may result in messages not being displayed correctly or at
    all.
