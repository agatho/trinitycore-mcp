  class: Object
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Object::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves debug information for an object including its type, GUID, and relevant
    attributes.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method returns a formatted string containing comprehensive
    debug information about the Object instance. This includes the object's type,
    its unique identifier (GUID), and key attributes such as its entry or display
    ID. The method is primarily used for debugging purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework, allowing developers to quickly identify object properties during development
    and testing phases. It provides a standardized way to access object metadata without
    requiring direct access to internal fields.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a string containing formatted debug information including object
    type, GUID, and relevant attributes. The string format typically includes the
    object's type name followed by its GUID and key properties for quick identification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Object* obj = new Player();

      std::string debugInfo = obj->GetDebugInfo();

      std::cout << debugInfo << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Info in Game Context
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGUID(12345);

      std::string debugInfo = player->GetDebugInfo();

      // Output: "Player GUID: 12345, Entry: 0"

      std::cout << debugInfo << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method typically uses internal object
    attributes to construct the debug string. Performance considerations are minimal
    as it only constructs a string rather than performing complex operations. Thread
    safety is generally not an issue since the method does not modify object state.
  warnings: The method may not be suitable for production use due to performance overhead
    in high-frequency scenarios. Common mistake includes relying on this method for
    critical game logic instead of using more efficient alternatives.
