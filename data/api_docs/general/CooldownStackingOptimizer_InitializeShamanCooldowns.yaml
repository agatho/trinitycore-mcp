documentation:
  brief: Initializes shaman-specific cooldown tracking and management for the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    class.
  description: The InitializeShamanCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and configurations required for managing cooldowns specific to shaman class abilities
    within the CooldownStackingOptimizer framework. This includes registering shaman
    spells, defining cooldown relationships, and preparing the optimizer to handle
    shaman-specific mechanics such as totems, elemental mastery, and weapon imbue
    effects. The method ensures that all relevant shaman cooldowns are properly tracked
    and prioritized during cooldown optimization calculations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeShamanCooldowns();

      // Cooldown tracking for shaman abilities is now initialized'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a shaman's
    cooldown optimization system. It prepares internal spell databases and cooldown
    mappings specific to shaman class abilities, including totem-based cooldowns and
    weapon enchantment effects.
