  class: WarriorAI
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void WarriorAI::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for warrior abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages the internal cooldown tracking for
    a warrior AI, decrementing active cooldowns by the specified time delta. This
    method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to ensure that abilities
    become available when their cooldown periods expire. It handles the core game
    mechanic of ability availability and prevents players from spamming abilities
    before they are ready. The method ensures that all warrior-specific abilities
    maintain proper timing and balance within the game system.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to decrement cooldown timers proportionally to real-time passage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void WarriorAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        // Process ability usage based\
      \ on updated cooldowns\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate cooldown state. The implementation likely uses internal timers or counters
    that are decremented by diff milliseconds each call. It's important for maintaining
    game balance and preventing ability spam.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper AI update context as it
    may cause incorrect cooldown behavior. Ensure that diff represents actual elapsed
    time to maintain realistic ability timing.
