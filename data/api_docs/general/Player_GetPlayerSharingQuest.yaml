  signature: int Player::GetPlayerSharingQuest() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player's sharing quest ID, which indicates the current quest
    being shared with other players.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the quest that is currently
    being shared with other players in the game. It represents the quest that a player
    is actively sharing with their group members or guild mates. The returned value
    can be used to determine if a player is sharing a quest, and what specific quest
    is being shared. This method is typically used in conjunction with quest sharing
    mechanics and group management systems within TrinityCore. The value returned
    by this method may be zero if no quest is currently being shared, or it may return
    the ID of a valid quest if one exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the quest ID that is currently being shared.
    A value of 0 indicates no active sharing quest, while non-zero values represent
    the ID of a valid quest being shared with other players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int sharingQuestID = player->GetPlayerSharingQuest();\nif (sharingQuestID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // A quest is being shared\n    // Do something with the sharingQuestID\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No quest is currently being shared\n    // Handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest sharing system in TrinityCore and should
    be used carefully when implementing group-based quest mechanics. It's important
    to note that this value may change frequently during gameplay, especially when
    players join or leave groups.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned quest ID actually exists
    in the database; developers should ensure that any code using this method properly
    handles cases where the quest ID might be invalid or non-existent.
