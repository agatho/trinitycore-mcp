  method: GetQueueSnapshot
  signature: int GroupEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current snapshot of the group queue status.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method returns an integer representing the current
    state or status of the group queue within the TrinityCore instance. This value
    typically reflects the number of players waiting in the queue, the queue's capacity,
    or a combined status indicator that can be used to determine if a group is ready
    for instance entry or if additional players are required. The method does not
    modify any internal state and is intended for read-only access to queue information.
    It is commonly used by group management systems, dungeon finder components, and
    player-facing UI elements to display queue status.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'An integer representing the current snapshot of the group queue. Possible
    values may include: 0 (queue empty), positive integers (number of players in queue),
    or negative values (error conditions or special states). The exact interpretation
    depends on internal queue logic and should be validated against expected behavior.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Queue Status
    code: "int queueStatus = groupEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queueStatus >\
      \ 0) {\n    printf(\"Players in queue: %d\\n\", queueStatus);\n} else if (queueStatus\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Queue is empty.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Error\
      \ or special state detected: %d\\n\", queueStatus);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not perform any locking operations internally.
    It should be used in performance-critical sections with caution, as frequent polling
    may impact system responsiveness. The return value's semantics are implementation-specific
    and may vary between different TrinityCore versions or configurations.
  warnings: Do not rely on specific numeric values for queue status interpretation
    without checking the actual implementation or documentation of the underlying
    queue system. Return values may change based on internal logic updates or server
    configuration changes.
