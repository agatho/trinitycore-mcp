  signature: bool EconomyManager::CanCraft(uint32 recipeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player can craft a specific recipe based on their current resources
    and requirements.
  description: The CanCraft method evaluates whether the player associated with the
    EconomyManager instance has sufficient resources, skills, and other prerequisites
    to craft a given recipe. This method typically checks for item availability in
    the player's inventory, required skill levels, and any additional conditions such
    as faction restrictions or quest completion. It is commonly used before attempting
    to craft an item to prevent invalid crafting attempts and provide appropriate
    feedback to the user.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can successfully craft the recipe, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that one or more requirements for crafting have
    not been met, such as missing materials, insufficient skill level, or unmet prerequisites.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Craft Check
    code: "if (economyManager->CanCraft(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with crafting logic\n\
      \    economyManager->CraftItem(12345);\n} else {\n    // Notify player that\
      \ they cannot craft the item\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not have\
      \ the required materials or skills to craft this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before initiating a crafting process to validate
    all preconditions. It may involve database lookups or complex calculations depending
    on the game's implementation, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    sections of code.
