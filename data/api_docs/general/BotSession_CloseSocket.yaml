documentation:
  brief: Closes the socket connection associated with the bot session.
  description: The CloseSocket method terminates the active socket connection for
    a BotSession instance. This method is typically invoked when a bot needs to disconnect
    from the game server, either due to a natural shutdown, error condition, or manual
    disconnection request. It ensures proper cleanup of network resources and may
    trigger associated cleanup routines within the TrinityCore framework. The method
    does not return any value and should be called before destroying the BotSession
    object to prevent resource leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Socket Closure
    code: 'BotSession* session = new BotSession();

      // ... perform bot operations ...

      session->CloseSocket();

      delete session;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal cleanup of socket-related data structures
    and may notify the server about the disconnection. It's recommended to call this
    before deleting a BotSession object to ensure proper resource deallocation.
