  class: AzeriteItem
  method: FindHeartForge
  signature: const int * AzeriteItem::FindHeartForge(const int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the heart forge associated with the azerite item.
  description: The FindHeartForge method retrieves the heart forge data linked to
    the current azerite item instance. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's Azerite system, where items can have associated heart forge
    properties that affect their behavior or appearance. The returned pointer may
    be null if no valid heart forge is associated with the item. This method does
    not take any parameters and operates on the internal state of the AzeriteItem
    object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the heart forge identifier,
    or nullptr if no heart forge is found for this azerite item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const int* heartForge = azeriteItem->FindHeartForge();\nif (heartForge\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Heart Forge ID: \" << *heartForge << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"No heart forge found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AzeriteItem class and relies on internal data
    structures that may vary based on game version and patch. Ensure that the azerite
    item has been properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not modify the value pointed to by the returned pointer, as it represents
    read-only data from the azerite item's internal state. Accessing the returned
    pointer after the AzeriteItem object has been destroyed may result in undefined
    behavior.
