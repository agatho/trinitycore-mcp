api:
  class: Player
  method: GetMails
  signature: const PlayerMails & Player::GetMails() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns all mails associated with the player.
  description: The GetMails method retrieves the complete collection of mails assigned
    to a player, including both inbox and mailbox contents. This method provides access
    to all mail items that have been received by the player, regardless of their status
    or whether they are read or unread. The returned PlayerMails object contains all
    mail data related to the player's character, allowing developers to iterate through
    or manipulate mail items as needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the PlayerMails structure which contains all
    mail items associated with the player. This reference allows for direct access
    to mail data without copying the entire structure.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Mails
    code: "PlayerMails const& mails = player->GetMails();\nfor (auto mail : mails)\n\
      {\n    // Process each mail item\n    std::cout << \"Mail ID: \" << mail->GetMailId()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the
    entire mail structure. This is important for performance when dealing with large
    numbers of mails. The PlayerMails object is typically populated during player
    initialization and may be updated during gameplay as new mails are received.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying mail data through this reference,
    as changes may affect the player's mail state in unexpected ways. Also note that
    this method does not return any mail that has been deleted or marked for deletion.
