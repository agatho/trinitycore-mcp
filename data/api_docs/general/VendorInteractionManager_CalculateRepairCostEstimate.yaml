  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: CalculateRepairCostEstimate
  signature: uint64 VendorInteractionManager::CalculateRepairCostEstimate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the estimated cost for repairing all damaged items
    in the vendor's inventory.
  description: The CalculateRepairCostEstimate method computes the total gold amount
    required to fully repair all items currently available for repair within the vendor's
    inventory. This estimation takes into account item durability, repair costs, and
    any applicable discounts or modifiers based on player relationship with the vendor.
    The returned value represents the approximate cost a player would need to pay
    to restore all items to maximum durability. This method is typically used in UI
    displays or when players request repair estimates before confirming repairs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total estimated gold cost for repairing
    all damaged items in the vendor's inventory. Returns 0 if no items are eligible
    for repair or if there are no damaged items available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 estimate = vendorInteractionManager.CalculateRepairCostEstimate();\n\
      if (estimate > 0)\n{\n    // Display the repair cost to the player\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Estimated repair cost: %u gold\", estimate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not actually perform any repairs; it only calculates an
    estimate. The calculation may vary based on vendor type, player reputation, and
    other game mechanics such as guild discounts or special vendor traits. Performance
    is generally fast as it's a simple summation of item repair costs.
  warnings: The returned value is an estimate and may differ from the actual cost
    if items are repaired in different quantities or if special conditions (like guild
    discounts) apply during the actual repair process.
