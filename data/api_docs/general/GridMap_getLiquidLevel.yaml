  class: GridMap
  method: getLiquidLevel
  signature: float GridMap::getLiquidLevel(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the liquid level at the specified coordinates within the grid map.
  description: The getLiquidLevel method returns the vertical position (Z-coordinate)
    of the liquid surface at the given X and Y coordinates on the grid map. This is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine water levels, lava
    heights, or other liquid boundaries for collision detection, movement validation,
    and environmental interaction. The method operates on the local grid coordinate
    system and provides accurate height information for liquid elements such as lakes,
    rivers, oceans, or magma pools. It does not perform any bounds checking, so callers
    should ensure coordinates are within valid map boundaries to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate in grid map space where the liquid level is to be
      retrieved.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate in grid map space where the liquid level is to be
      retrieved.
  returns: A float value representing the Z-coordinate (height) of the liquid surface
    at the specified location. Returns 0.0f if no liquid data exists at the given
    coordinates or if the coordinates are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check water level
    code: "float waterLevel = gridMap->getLiquidLevel(100.0f, 200.0f);\nif (waterLevel\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Player is in water\n    printf(\"Water level at (100, 200):\
      \ %f\\n\", waterLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using liquid level for movement validation
    code: "float playerZ = 50.0f;\nfloat liquidLevel = gridMap->getLiquidLevel(playerX,\
      \ playerY);\nif (liquidLevel > playerZ)\n{\n    // Player is below liquid surface\n\
      \    printf(\"Player submerged at (%f, %f)\\n\", playerX, playerY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal grid map data structures and assumes valid
    coordinate inputs. The returned Z-coordinate represents the height of the liquid
    surface relative to the map's base elevation. Performance is optimized for frequent
    calls but should still be used judiciously in performance-critical sections like
    movement updates or AI pathfinding.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid coordinates (outside the grid map bounds)
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values. Always validate input coordinates
    before calling, especially when dealing with dynamic positions or user input.
