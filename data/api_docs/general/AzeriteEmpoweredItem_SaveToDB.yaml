  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: SaveToDB
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::SaveToDB(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the azerite empowered item data to the database with optional transaction
    support.
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the current state of an AzeriteEmpoweredItem
    object into the game database. This method is typically invoked when changes to
    the item's azerite powers, levels, or other attributes need to be committed to
    persistent storage. The method accepts an optional transaction parameter that
    allows the save operation to be part of a larger database transaction, ensuring
    data consistency across multiple related operations. It handles all necessary
    database interactions including INSERT or UPDATE statements depending on whether
    the item already exists in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Optional database transaction identifier. If provided, the save operation
      will be executed within the context of this transaction. A value of -1 indicates
      no transaction is used, and the method will manage its own transaction scope.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Save Operation
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...;

      item->SaveToDB(); // Saves using default transaction handling'
    language: cpp
  - title: Save with Transaction Context
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...;

      TransactionType trans = ...; // Assume valid transaction

      item->SaveToDB(trans); // Saves within the provided transaction scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when changes to the azerite empowered item
    have been made and persistence is required. The method may perform database I/O
    operations which could impact performance if called frequently in tight loops.
    It's recommended to batch multiple save operations together when possible.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper transaction management can lead to
    inconsistent data states if other related operations fail. Ensure that the item's
    state is valid before calling SaveToDB, as invalid data may cause database constraint
    violations or corruption.
