  class: DungeonScript
  method: MoveTo
  signature: void DungeonScript::MoveTo(int * player, const int & position) const
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player to a specified position within the dungeon.
  description: The MoveTo method is used to teleport a player to a specific location
    within a dungeon instance. This method is typically invoked by dungeon scripts
    to control player movement during quest events, boss encounters, or scripted sequences.
    The method takes a pointer to a player object and a position coordinate, and moves
    the player to that location immediately without any animation or delay. It's commonly
    used in custom dungeon scripts to manage player positioning during complex encounters
    or to guide players through specific paths.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that will be moved. This parameter must
      point to a valid Player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: position
    description: Reference to the position coordinate where the player should be moved.
      This typically represents a 3D vector (x, y, z) defining the target location
      within the dungeon map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Movement
    code: "void DungeonScript::MoveTo(Player* player, const Position& position) const\
      \ {\n    if (player && !position.IsPositionValid())\n        return;\n    \n\
      \    player->NearTeleportTo(position);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Moving Player to Boss Encounter Location
    code: "void BossEncounterScript::MovePlayerToBossArea(Player* player) const {\n\
      \    Position bossPosition = {1234.5f, 6789.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f};\n    MoveTo(player,\
      \ bossPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method bypasses normal movement restrictions and teleportation checks.
    It should only be used in controlled script contexts where immediate positioning
    is required. The method does not trigger any movement-related events or callbacks
    that would normally occur during regular player movement.
  warnings: Using this method outside of proper dungeon scripting contexts may cause
    unexpected behavior or client desynchronization. Ensure the target position is
    valid and within the dungeon boundaries to prevent players from being teleported
    to invalid locations.
