  class: HunterAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void HunterAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes hunter AI behavior when entering combat with a target.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a hunter AI unit enters combat
    mode, typically triggered by an enemy engagement. This method sets up initial
    combat states and prepares the AI for executing combat behaviors such as targeting,
    casting abilities, or positioning. It may also initialize internal timers, flags,
    or state variables required for proper AI operation during combat. The method
    is part of the core AI framework in TrinityCore and is automatically called by
    the game engine when combat begins.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the integer ID of the target entity that initiated combat.
      This value represents the GUID of the enemy unit the hunter is now engaged with.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyHunterAI : public HunterAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart(int*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Custom initialization logic\n        hunter->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_RAPID_FIRE, true);\n        HunterAI::OnCombatStart(target);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system and
    should not be invoked manually unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The target
    parameter is guaranteed to be valid at the time of call, assuming combat was properly
    initiated.
  warnings: Avoid modifying or deleting the target entity directly within this method
    as it may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that any spell casting or
    action execution respects the game's timing and cooldown restrictions.
