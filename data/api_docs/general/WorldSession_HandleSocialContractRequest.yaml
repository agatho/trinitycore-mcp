documentation:
  brief: Processes a social contract request packet from a client, initiating social
    interaction with another player.
  description: The HandleSocialContractRequest method is responsible for handling
    incoming social contract requests sent by players in the World of Warcraft client.
    This method processes the packet to establish or manage social interactions such
    as friendship, guild invitations, or other player-to-player social contracts.
    It validates the request parameters and triggers appropriate game mechanics based
    on the type of social contract being requested. The method operates within the
    WorldSession context, ensuring that only authenticated and valid players can initiate
    these interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Social Contract Request Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSocialContractRequest(WorldPackets::Social::SocialContractRequest&\
      \ socialContractRequest)\n{\n    // Validate the request\n    if (!socialContractRequest.TargetGuid)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process the contract request\n    Player* player\
      \ = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    // Forward to\
      \ social system for handling\n    sSocialMgr->HandleContractRequest(player,\
      \ socialContractRequest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the packet processing pipeline when
    a client sends a social contract request. It assumes that the session has been
    authenticated and that the player object is valid. The actual implementation of
    social contract handling is delegated to the SocialManager subsystem.
  warnings: Improper validation of the social contract request could lead to security
    vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Ensure all GUIDs are validated against
    active players before processing any social interactions.
