  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindCreatureByGuid
  signature: const DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::CreatureSnapshot * SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindCreatureByGuid(Player
    * bot, int guid, float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds a creature by its GUID within a specified search radius around the
    player.
  description: The FindCreatureByGuid method searches for a specific creature identified
    by its unique identifier (GUID) within a defined radius around the given player.
    It utilizes the spatial grid system to efficiently locate creatures in the game
    world, making it suitable for AI behavior and quest-related logic. The method
    returns a snapshot of the creature's current state if found, or nullptr if no
    matching creature exists within the specified range. This function is commonly
    used in botting systems or automated gameplay scripts where precise creature targeting
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player character
      performing the search.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the creature
      to locate.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance in yards within which to
      search for the creature.
  returns: A pointer to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::CreatureSnapshot structure containing
    the creature's current data if found, or nullptr if no creature with the specified
    GUID exists within the search radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player\nint targetGuid = 12345;\n\
      float radius = 50.0f;\nconst DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::CreatureSnapshot* creature\
      \ = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindCreatureByGuid(bot, targetGuid, radius);\n\
      if (creature != nullptr) {\n    // Creature found, proceed with logic\n    printf(\"\
      Found creature with GUID %d at position (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", \n           creature->GetGUID(),\
      \ creature->GetPositionX(), creature->GetPositionY(), creature->GetPositionZ());\n\
      } else {\n    // No creature found within radius\n    printf(\"Creature not\
      \ found within %.2f yards\\n\", radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid for efficient spatial
    queries. The returned snapshot may be stale if accessed outside of a thread-safe
    context. Consider using this function in conjunction with proper locking mechanisms
    when dealing with multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an actual creature
    in the game world; otherwise, the method will return nullptr. Also, be cautious
    about performance implications when searching large areas or calling this function
    frequently in tight loops.
