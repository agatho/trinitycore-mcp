  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ApplyMigrations
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyMigrations()
documentation:
  brief: Applies all pending player bot migrations to update character data and configurations.
  description: The ApplyMigrations method executes all queued player bot configuration
    and data migrations within the PlayerbotMigrationMgr. This method ensures that
    player bots are updated with the latest changes, including skill adjustments,
    equipment updates, and behavior modifications required by newer versions of the
    TrinityCore player bot system. It processes each migration in sequence, handling
    potential errors gracefully and returning a success status. The method should
    be called during server startup or when applying system-wide updates to maintain
    consistency across all player bot configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all migrations were successfully applied, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that at least one migration failed, which may
    require manual intervention or retry logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ApplyMigrations()) {\n    // All\
      \ migrations applied successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot migrations\
      \ completed successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Migration failure occurred\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to apply player bot migrations.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization or maintenance
    windows. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning it can safely be called multiple
    times without causing issues. The method may block execution until all migrations
    are processed, so consider calling it asynchronously in performance-critical scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method while player bots are actively in use may cause unexpected
    behavior or data inconsistencies. It's recommended to disable active player bot
    functionality before invoking this method, especially during server updates or
    maintenance periods.
