  brief: Converts a string representation of a GUID into an ObjectGuid instance
  description: The FromString method parses a string input and converts it into a
    valid ObjectGuid object. This utility function is commonly used in TrinityCore
    when working with database entries, packet data, or configuration values that
    store GUIDs as strings. The method handles parsing of various GUID formats including
    decimal and hexadecimal representations. It's particularly useful for converting
    user-provided identifiers or serialized data back into proper ObjectGuid objects
    for use within the game world. The function performs basic validation to ensure
    the input string represents a valid GUID format before creating the resulting
    ObjectGuid instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid instance constructed from the provided string input.
    If the input string is invalid or cannot be parsed into a valid GUID, the method
    may return a default/invalid ObjectGuid object with zero value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID String Conversion
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::FromString("12345");

      // Creates an ObjectGuid representing player with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using With Database Values
    code: "std::string dbGuidString = \"987654321\";\nObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::FromString(dbGuidString);\n\
      if (guid.IsPlayer()) {\n    // Process player GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with database operations where
    GUIDs are stored as strings. The implementation may perform implicit conversion
    from string to integer and then construct the ObjectGuid from that value. Ensure
    input validation when using this method with external data sources.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input format. Invalid strings may result in undefined
    behavior or zero GUID values. Always validate the returned ObjectGuid before using
    it in game logic operations.
