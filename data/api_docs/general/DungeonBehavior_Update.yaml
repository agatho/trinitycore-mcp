  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: Update
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dungeon behavior state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of a dungeon behavior instance during each game tick. It handles time-based
    logic, such as checking for completion conditions, managing timers, or updating
    NPC behaviors within the dungeon environment. This method is typically called
    by the game's main update loop and receives a delta time value representing the
    milliseconds elapsed since the last update. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific dungeon type and its defined behavior rules.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update
      call. Used to calculate time-based changes in behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& dungeon : m_dungeons)\n\
      \    {\n        dungeon->Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game loop to ensure proper
    behavior updates. It's important that the diff parameter accurately reflects the
    time passed, as incorrect timing can lead to inconsistent dungeon behavior or
    timing-based bugs.
