  class: MapSessionFilter
  method: Process
  signature: bool MapSessionFilter::Process(WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a WorldPacket through the map session filter to determine if it
    should be sent to clients.
  description: The MapSessionFilter::Process method evaluates whether a given WorldPacket
    should be forwarded to connected client sessions on the map. This filtering mechanism
    is used to ensure that only relevant packets are transmitted to players, reducing
    network overhead and preventing unnecessary data transfer. The method typically
    checks packet types, player visibility, and other contextual factors before deciding
    whether to send the packet. It's commonly used in the context of object updates,
    player movement, and world state changes within a specific map instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the packet should be processed and sent to clients; returns
    false if the packet should be filtered out and not sent.
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet filtering usage
    code: "bool shouldSend = mapSessionFilter.Process(&packet);\nif (shouldSend)\n\
      {\n    // Send packet to all relevant players\n    map->SendMessageToSet(&packet,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the update cycle of a map instance.
    The filtering logic may depend on player visibility ranges, object states, and
    current map conditions. Performance considerations include avoiding expensive
    operations within this method as it's called frequently during world updates.
