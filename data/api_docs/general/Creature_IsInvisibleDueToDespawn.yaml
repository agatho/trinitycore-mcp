documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature is invisible due to despawn.
  description: This method checks if a creature is currently invisible as a result
    of being despawned, which occurs when the creature's despawn timer has expired
    or when it has been removed from the world. The method returns true if the creature
    is invisible due to despawn, false otherwise. It is commonly used in AI scripts
    and game logic to determine if a creature should be considered as having disappeared
    from the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is invisible due to despawn, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature has either been removed from the world or its
    despawn timer has expired, making it invisible to players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsInvisibleDueToDespawn())\n{\n    // Creature is invisible\
      \ due to despawn\n    // Perform actions accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature state checks.
    It may be called during AI updates or event handling when determining if a creature
    should be considered as having disappeared from the world.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other visibility checks such as
    IsInvisible or IsVisible. It only applies to creatures that have been despawned,
    not those that are invisible due to other reasons like stealth or invisibility.
