  class: CreatureTextMgr
  method: TextExist
  signature: bool CreatureTextMgr::TextExist(uint32 sourceEntry, uint8 textGroup)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific creature text group exists for a given entry.
  description: The TextExist method determines whether a particular creature text
    group has been defined for a specified creature entry in the database. This is
    used primarily during NPC dialogue handling to verify that the requested text
    group exists before attempting to retrieve or play it. The method performs a lookup
    using the sourceEntry (creature entry ID) and textGroup (text group identifier)
    parameters to check for existence within the CreatureTextMgr's internal data structures.
    It returns true if the combination of creature entry and text group is found,
    false otherwise. This functionality supports proper dialogue flow control in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceEntry
    description: The creature entry ID (creature_template.entry) for which to check
      text existence. Must be a valid creature template identifier present in the
      database.
  - name: textGroup
    description: The text group identifier (CreatureTextGroup.groupid) to verify existence
      for the specified creature entry. Valid range is typically 0-255, though exact
      limits depend on database schema.
  returns: Returns true if the specified creature text group exists for the given
    source entry; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the text data is
    available for retrieval or playback.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check text existence
    code: "if (sCreatureTextMgr->TextExist(12345, 0)) {\n    // Text group 0 exists\
      \ for creature entry 12345\n    // Proceed with dialogue logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional dialogue flow
    code: "uint32 npcEntry = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith();\nif (npcEntry && sCreatureTextMgr->TextExist(npcEntry,\
      \ 1)) {\n    // Safe to proceed with text group 1 for this NPC\n    sCreatureTextMgr->SendText(player,\
      \ npcEntry, 1);\n} else {\n    // No text defined for this group, fallback behavior\n\
      \    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendCloseGossip();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as a pre-check before attempting to send creature
    text to players. The internal implementation likely uses hash maps or similar
    data structures for fast lookup performance. It's important to note that this
    check only validates existence of the text group itself, not the actual text content
    or whether it can be played under current conditions.
  warnings: This method does not validate the player's ability to hear or interact
    with the creature. It simply checks database presence. Using this without proper
    context validation may lead to silent failures in dialogue systems. Also, be aware
    that text groups are indexed by group ID within a single creature entry, so multiple
    creatures can share the same group ID without conflict.
