documentation:
  brief: Removes all expired obstacles from the obstacle avoidance system
  description: The CleanupExpiredObstacles method iterates through the list of registered
    obstacles and removes any that have exceeded their valid lifetime. This method
    is typically called during periodic updates to maintain performance and prevent
    memory leaks from accumulating stale obstacle data. The system tracks obstacle
    expiration times and automatically purges those that are no longer relevant for
    pathfinding calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    m_obstacleManager->CleanupExpiredObstacles();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the game loop to prevent
    memory buildup. It's typically invoked during periodic AI updates or obstacle
    management cycles. The cleanup operation is optimized to avoid iterator invalidation
    issues by using a two-phase removal approach.
