  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraModBaseResistancePCT
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModBaseResistancePCT(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a percentage-based modification to the base resistance
    of an aura application.
  description: The HandleAuraModBaseResistancePCT method modifies the base resistance
    of a target by a specified percentage when applied or removed from an aura. This
    method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events, adjusting
    the target's resistance values based on the aura's effect. The modification affects
    all resistance types (fire, frost, nature, shadow, arcane, and holy) uniformly.
    It is used in various game mechanics such as spell effects that alter a character's
    resistance to different damage types.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter determines which aura's effect is processed
      and on which target the modification is applied.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the aura is being
      applied (1) or removed (0). The value influences how the resistance percentage
      is calculated and applied to the target.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). When true, the resistance percentage is added; when false,
      it's subtracted from the base resistance values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Resistance Buff
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      auraEffect->HandleAuraModBaseResistancePCT(app, 1, true); // Apply 10% resistance
      buff'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Resistance Debuff
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      auraEffect->HandleAuraModBaseResistancePCT(app, 0, false); // Remove resistance
      debuff'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the target's resistance values directly and may affect
    combat calculations. It is part of the aura system in TrinityCore and interacts
    with the target's stat management system. Ensure that this method is called only
    during appropriate aura application/removal events to maintain game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect resistance calculations,
    potentially causing unbalanced gameplay or unexpected combat outcomes. Always
    verify that the aura effect parameters are correctly set before calling this method.
