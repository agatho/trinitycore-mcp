  method: FindNearestNode
  signature: const GatheringNode * GatheringManager::FindNearestNode(GatheringNodeType
    nodeType) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest gathering node of the specified type within
    the current map.
  description: The FindNearestNode method searches through all active gathering nodes
    in the current map and returns a pointer to the one that is closest to the player's
    current position. This method is typically used by players or NPCs to locate nearby
    resources such as mining veins, herbalism plants, or other gatherable objects.
    The method performs a spatial search using the node's coordinates and calculates
    the Euclidean distance to determine proximity. It will return NULL if no nodes
    of the specified type exist in the current map or if the player is not within
    a valid map context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the const GatheringNode object representing the nearest gathering
    node of the specified type, or NULL if no such node exists in the current map.
  examples:
  - title: Finding the nearest mining vein
    code: "const GatheringNode* mineNode = gatheringManager->FindNearestNode(GATHERING_NODE_TYPE_ORE);\n\
      if (mineNode)\n{\n    // Proceed with mining logic\n    printf(\"Found ore node\
      \ at: %f, %f\\n\", mineNode->GetPositionX(), mineNode->GetPositionY());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all known gathering nodes in
    the current map, which may impact performance if there are many nodes. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the node exists and has not been removed from
    the map.
  warnings: The method returns NULL when no matching nodes are found; always check
    for null before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults. Be aware
    that this method does not account for obstacles or line-of-sight, so the returned
    node may not be directly accessible.
