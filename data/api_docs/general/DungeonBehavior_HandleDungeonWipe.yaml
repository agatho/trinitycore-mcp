  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleDungeonWipe
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleDungeonWipe(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a dungeon group wipes, resetting the dungeon state
    and notifying players.
  description: The HandleDungeonWipe method is responsible for managing the consequences
    of a group failing a dungeon encounter. When invoked, it typically resets the
    dungeon's progress, updates player states, and may trigger rewards or penalties
    based on the wipe event. This method ensures that the game state remains consistent
    after a group fails to complete a dungeon. It is usually called by the dungeon
    management system when all members of a group are defeated or leave the instance.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal dungeon and player
    data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the party that has wiped
      in the dungeon. This parameter must be valid and non-null for the method to
      function correctly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleDungeonWipe
    code: "Group* playerGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif\
      \ (playerGroup)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior->HandleDungeonWipe(playerGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore dungeon system
    upon detection of a group wipe. It assumes that the group pointer passed to it
    is valid and represents an active dungeon instance. The implementation may involve
    sending updates to players, resetting timers, or adjusting loot distribution.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Group pointer to this method can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is currently in a dungeon instance
    before calling this function.
