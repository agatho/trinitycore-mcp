  brief: Processes a client request to query information about a game object by its
    entry ID
  description: The HandleGameObjectQueryOpcode method handles incoming queries from
    clients requesting detailed information about a specific game object. This method
    is typically invoked when a player interacts with or examines a game object in
    the World of Warcraft client. It retrieves the game object's template data from
    the database and sends it back to the requesting client as a response packet.
    The method ensures that only valid, existing game objects are queried and responds
    appropriately to invalid requests. This functionality supports features like object
    inspection, quest item identification, and general object metadata retrieval within
    the game world.

  - title: Basic GameObject Query Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGameObjectQueryOpcode(WorldPackets::Query::QueryGameObject&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!packet.Entry)\n        return;\n\n    GameObjectTemplate\
      \ const* goInfo = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(packet.Entry);\n    if (!goInfo)\n\
      \        return;\n\n    WorldPackets::Query::GameObjectQueryResponse response;\n\
      \    response.Entry = packet.Entry;\n    response.Name = goInfo->name;\n   \
      \ response.DisplayID = goInfo->displayId;\n    // ... populate other fields\n\
      \    SendPacket(response.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and operates
    on the main game thread. It performs database lookups which may impact performance
    if called excessively with many simultaneous queries. The method assumes that
    the client has already validated basic input parameters before sending the request.
  warnings: Improper handling of invalid entry IDs could lead to crashes or inconsistent
    behavior. Ensure proper bounds checking and null pointer validation when accessing
    GameObjectTemplate data. This method should not be used for frequent real-time
    queries as it may cause performance degradation.
