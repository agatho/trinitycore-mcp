  method: SetMasterLooterGuid
  signature: void Group::SetMasterLooterGuid(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the master looter for the group.
  description: The SetMasterLooterGuid method assigns a new master looter to the group
    by setting the GUID of the player who will have master loot privileges. This method
    is typically used when transferring master looter rights from one player to another
    within a group, such as during group disbanding or when a new leader takes control.
    The GUID parameter should correspond to a valid player in the group. This method
    does not validate whether the specified GUID belongs to an active player or if
    they are even in the group, so it's up to the calling code to ensure proper usage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become the new
      master looter. This should be a valid player GUID within the group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning Master Looter to a Player
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 newMasterLooterGuid\
      \ = player2->GetGUID();\n    group->SetMasterLooterGuid(newMasterLooterGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the group and does not
    perform any validation on the GUID provided. It's recommended to verify that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid player in the group before calling this method to
    prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or loss of master looter functionality within the group. Ensure
    proper checks are performed on the GUID value before assignment.
