  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: ShouldFocusAdd
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldFocusAdd()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat behavior should focus on a specific add target.
  description: The ShouldFocusAdd method evaluates the current combat state and AI
    logic to decide if the creature or NPC should prioritize attacking a specific
    add (additional enemy unit) over other targets. This decision is typically based
    on factors such as threat distribution, target priority, and combat strategy.
    The method is commonly used in scripted encounters where certain adds need to
    be focused down before engaging the main boss or other high-priority targets.
    It helps maintain balanced and strategic combat behavior in complex encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should focus on a specific add target, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the current combat behavior logic dictates
    prioritizing the add over other available targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->ShouldFocusAdd())\n{\n    // Switch to focus on\
      \ the targeted add\n    creature->AttackStart(targetAdd);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI behavior
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public CombatBehaviorIntegration\n{\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ ShouldFocusAdd() override\n    {\n        // Custom logic to determine if\
      \ we should focus an add\n        return !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)\
      \ &&\n               me->GetThreatManager().GetHighestThreat()->GetTarget()\
      \ != nullptr;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be lightweight
    to avoid performance impact. The decision logic may involve checking current threat
    levels, target validity, and encounter-specific rules. It's important to note
    that this method does not perform the actual targeting; it only determines whether
    focusing on an add is appropriate.
  warnings: Ensure that the method is not called in contexts where target validation
    hasn't been performed, as this could lead to invalid targets being focused. Also,
    be aware that frequent calls to this method without proper caching may impact
    performance in high-frequency combat scenarios.
