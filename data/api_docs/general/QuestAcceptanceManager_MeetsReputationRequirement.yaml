documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the reputation requirements for accepting a quest
  description: The MeetsReputationRequirement method evaluates whether the player
    character has sufficient reputation with the required factions to accept a specific
    quest. This method typically checks against faction thresholds defined in the
    quest's reputation requirements. It is used during quest acceptance validation
    to ensure players meet the necessary standing prerequisites before they can begin
    a quest. The method returns true if all reputation conditions are satisfied, or
    false if any requirement is not met. This functionality is integral to the World
    of Warcraft quest system and helps maintain game balance by ensuring players progress
    through factions in an appropriate manner.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. The value should
      correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the player's reputation with all required factions meets
    or exceeds the minimum thresholds specified in the quest requirements; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (questManager.MeetsReputationRequirement(&questId)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Reputation\
      \ requirements not met\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not meet the reputation\
      \ requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!quest) return;\n\
      \    \n    int questId = quest->GetQuestId();\n    if (sQuestAcceptanceManager->MeetsReputationRequirement(&questId))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with normal quest acceptance\n        Player::OnQuestAccept(quest);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Prevent quest acceptance and notify player\n     \
      \   SendNotification(\"Your reputation is not sufficient to accept this quest.\"\
      );\n        return;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses faction data from the database and compares it
    against cached or loaded reputation values. It may involve multiple faction checks
    for a single quest, depending on how the quest is configured in the game files.
    The method should be called before attempting to add a quest to the player's active
    quests to prevent invalid state.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    quest entry in the database; passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could
    lead to undefined behavior. This method does not modify any player state directly,
    but its result should be used to control quest acceptance flow.
