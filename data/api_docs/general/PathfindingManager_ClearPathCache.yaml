  method: ClearPathCache
  signature: void PathfindingManager::ClearPathCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the entire pathfinding cache used by the PathfindingManager.
  description: The ClearPathCache method invalidates and removes all cached path data
    within the PathfindingManager. This operation is typically invoked when pathfinding
    data becomes stale or when significant map changes occur, such as during instance
    loading or terrain modifications. The method ensures that subsequent pathfinding
    requests will recalculate paths from scratch rather than using potentially outdated
    cached results. It is an essential utility for maintaining pathfinding accuracy
    in dynamic game environments.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingManager* pfm = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      pfm->ClearPathCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It may cause
    a temporary performance hit as new paths will need to be recalculated upon next
    request.
