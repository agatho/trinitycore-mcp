  class: EssenceResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool EssenceResource::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of essence resource and returns true if successful.
  description: The Consume method reduces the current amount of essence resource by
    the specified quantity. It is typically used in game mechanics where players or
    NPCs spend essence to perform abilities, cast spells, or activate special effects.
    The method performs a check to ensure that sufficient resources are available
    before consuming them. If the requested amount exceeds the available resource
    count, the consumption will fail and return false without modifying the resource
    value. This method is commonly used in conjunction with resource regeneration
    systems and ability cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of essence resource was successfully
    consumed; otherwise returns false if there are insufficient resources available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetEssenceResource()->Consume(50)) {\n    // Essence successfully\
      \ consumed, proceed with ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ESSENCE_BOLT);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough essence, notify player\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough essence!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Consumption with Logging
    code: "uint32 requiredEssence = 100;\nif (player->GetEssenceResource()->Consume(requiredEssence))\
      \ {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"entities\", \"Player consumed {} essence units\", requiredEssence);\n\
      \    // Continue with spell casting or ability activation\n} else {\n    LOG_WARNING(\"\
      entities\", \"Player tried to consume {} essence but had only {} available\"\
      , requiredEssence, player->GetEssenceResource()->GetCurrentAmount());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe when used with proper synchronization
    mechanisms in multi-threaded environments. The resource value should be checked
    before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations. Performance impact
    is minimal as it only involves simple arithmetic and comparison operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available resources may lead to inconsistent
    game state if the system expects a successful consumption. Always verify sufficient
    resources are present before attempting consumption, especially in critical gameplay
    scenarios.
