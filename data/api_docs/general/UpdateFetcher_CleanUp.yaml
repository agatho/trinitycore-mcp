  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: CleanUp
  signature: void UpdateFetcher::CleanUp(const AppliedFileStorage & storage) const
documentation:
  brief: Cleans up and releases resources associated with the applied file storage.
  description: The CleanUp method is responsible for releasing any resources or memory
    that were allocated during the processing of an applied file storage. This typically
    involves freeing dynamically allocated memory, closing file handles, or resetting
    internal state to prevent memory leaks or resource exhaustion. The method ensures
    proper cleanup of temporary data structures and maintains system stability by
    preventing dangling references or corrupted state after operations involving file
    storage have completed.
  parameters:
  - name: storage
    description: The AppliedFileStorage object containing the file data and metadata
      that needs to be cleaned up. This parameter represents the complete set of files
      and their associated processing state that should be released from memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CleanUp Usage
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      AppliedFileStorage storage;

      // ... populate storage with file data ...

      fetcher.CleanUp(storage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: CleanUp in Update Context
    code: "void ProcessUpdate() {\n    UpdateFetcher fetcher;\n    AppliedFileStorage\
      \ storage = fetcher.FetchFiles();\n    // ... perform update operations ...\n\
      \    fetcher.CleanUp(storage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after all file processing is complete to ensure
    proper resource management. It's typically invoked automatically by the UpdateFetcher
    class during its lifecycle, but may also be explicitly called when immediate cleanup
    is required.
  warnings: Calling CleanUp on an already cleaned-up storage object may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the storage object remains valid until
    after this method completes.
