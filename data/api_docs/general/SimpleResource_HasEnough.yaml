documentation:
  brief: Checks if the resource has enough amount available for use
  description: The HasEnough method determines whether the current SimpleResource
    instance contains a sufficient quantity of the resource to fulfill a requested
    amount. This method is typically used in game mechanics where resources such as
    mana, energy, or currency need to be validated before being consumed. The check
    is performed against the internal resource count stored within the SimpleResource
    object. It returns true if the available amount is greater than or equal to the
    requested amount, and false otherwise. This method does not modify the resource
    count but only performs a read-only comparison.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource has enough amount available; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "SimpleResource resource(100);\nif (resource.HasEnough(50)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with resource consumption\n    printf(\"Sufficient resources available\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    printf(\"Not enough resources\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Game Action Validation
    code: "void CastSpell(Player* player, uint32 spellId) {\n    SpellInfo const*\
      \ spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\n    if (spellInfo && player->HasEnoughPower(spellInfo->PowerType,\
      \ spellInfo->ManaCost)) {\n        // Proceed with spell casting\n        player->ModifyPower(spellInfo->PowerType,\
      \ -spellInfo->ManaCost);\n    } else {\n        SendCastResult(spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple comparison operation and is generally fast.
    It assumes that the resource amount is non-negative and that the internal state
    of the SimpleResource object is consistent. The method does not perform any locking
    or synchronization, so in multi-threaded environments, external synchronization
    may be required.
  warnings: Ensure that the resource amount being checked is valid and within expected
    bounds. This method will return false if the requested amount exceeds the available
    resources, but it does not prevent overconsumption if used without proper validation
    logic.
