  class: WhoListPlayerInfo
  method: IsGameMaster
  signature: bool WhoListPlayerInfo::IsGameMaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is a game master by checking their security
    level.
  description: The IsGameMaster method checks if the player associated with this WhoListPlayerInfo
    object has administrative privileges. In TrinityCore, players with a security
    level greater than 0 are considered game masters. This method is typically used
    in player listing and filtering systems, such as the /who command, to distinguish
    between regular players and those with elevated permissions. The check is performed
    against the player's current security level stored within the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a security level greater than 0 (i.e., is
    a game master), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player is a game master
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// Assume playerInfo is populated with data\n\
      if (playerInfo.IsGameMaster()) {\n    std::cout << \"This player is a game master.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"This player is not a game master.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal security level of the player, which can
    be modified through in-game commands or database updates. This check does not
    account for temporary GM status or role-based permissions beyond the basic security
    level.
