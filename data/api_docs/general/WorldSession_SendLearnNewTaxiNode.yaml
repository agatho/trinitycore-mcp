  signature: bool WorldSession::SendLearnNewTaxiNode(Creature * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the client indicating that the player has learned a new
    taxi node.
  description: The SendLearnNewTaxiNode method is responsible for notifying the player's
    client that they have discovered a new flight path node. This typically occurs
    when a player interacts with a flight master or completes certain quest objectives
    that unlock new taxi routes. The method constructs and sends an appropriate network
    packet to the client, updating their local taxi map data. It returns true if the
    packet was successfully queued for sending, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is integral to the World of Warcraft taxi system and ensures that players can
    access newly unlocked flight paths.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the packet was successfully queued for transmission to
    the client; returns false if there was an error during packet preparation or queuing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "if (player->GetSession()->SendLearnNewTaxiNode(flightMaster))\n{\n    //\
      \ Taxi node learned successfully\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have learned\
      \ a new taxi node.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying WorldSession's packet sending infrastructure.
    It should only be called when a player has actually gained access to a new taxi
    node, typically after quest completion or NPC interaction. The actual flight path
    data is managed by the server-side taxi system and must be properly initialized
    before this method can function correctly.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player's ability
    to learn the taxi node may result in client-side errors or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that the player has actually unlocked the node through legitimate gameplay
    progression before invoking this method.
