documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SharedInstanceLockData object and releases associated resources.
  description: The ~SharedInstanceLockData destructor is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources held by the SharedInstanceLockData instance. This includes releasing
    locks, cleaning up internal data structures, and ensuring proper cleanup of shared
    memory or synchronization primitives used in instance locking mechanisms within
    TrinityCore's world server. The destructor ensures that when an instance lock
    data object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, all associated resources
    are properly released to prevent memory leaks or deadlocks.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of SharedInstanceLockData
    code: 'SharedInstanceLockData* lockData = new SharedInstanceLockData();

      // ... use the lock data ...

      delete lockData; // Triggers ~SharedInstanceLockData()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a SharedInstanceLockData object
    is destroyed. It's important to ensure that all locks are properly released before
    destruction to avoid potential deadlocks in multi-threaded environments. The destructor
    may perform cleanup operations that involve synchronization primitives, so it
    should not be called from within a locked context.
