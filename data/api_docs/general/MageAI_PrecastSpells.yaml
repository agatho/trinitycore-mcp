  class: MageAI
  method: PrecastSpells
  signature: void MageAI::PrecastSpells(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Prepares and casts mage spells based on current target and AI state.
  description: The PrecastSpells method is responsible for determining which spells
    should be cast by a Mage AI unit before engaging in combat or during an active
    fight. It evaluates the current target, available spell resources, and AI decision-making
    logic to select appropriate precast abilities such as Arcane Missiles, Fireball,
    Frostbolt, or other mage-specific spells. This method typically executes before
    the main AI loop and ensures that the mage unit is prepared with optimal spell
    combinations for immediate use. The behavior may vary depending on the current
    combat situation, target type, and spell cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Mage AI context
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    PrecastSpells(mVictim);\n    // Continue with normal AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the MageAI class during AI
    update cycles. It assumes that a valid target exists and that spell casting conditions
    are met. The actual spell selection logic depends on internal AI state variables
    and spell availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid before calling this method to avoid
    potential crashes or undefined behavior. This method does not handle spell cooldowns
    directly but relies on the AI's internal state management for proper timing.
