  signature: uint32 Item::GetTotalPurchasedArtifactPowers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of purchased artifact powers for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the cumulative count of artifact power items
    that have been purchased for the current item. It is used primarily in the context
    of artifact gear systems within World of Warcraft, where items can have multiple
    artifact powers associated with them. The method provides a way to determine how
    many artifact powers have been acquired through purchases or upgrades, which affects
    the item's overall artifact power level and progression. This functionality is
    essential for tracking artifact progression and determining item quality in relation
    to artifact power.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of purchased artifact
    powers associated with this item. This value typically corresponds to the sum
    of all artifact power items that have been purchased or upgraded for the item,
    and may be used in calculations related to artifact power progression or item
    quality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 artifactPowers = item->GetTotalPurchasedArtifactPowers();\nif (artifactPowers\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Item has purchased artifact powers\n    // Do something with\
      \ the artifact power count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore to track artifact progression
    and may be tied to specific artifact power calculations. It should be noted that
    this value can only be accessed when the item is in a valid state where artifact
    powers have been purchased or upgraded. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this method simply returns a stored value.
  warnings: This method should not be used for items that do not have artifact powers
    associated with them, as it may return incorrect values or cause undefined behavior
    if the item's artifact power state is not properly initialized.
