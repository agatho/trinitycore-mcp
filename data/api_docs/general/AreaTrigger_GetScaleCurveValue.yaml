  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetScaleCurveValue
  signature: float AreaTrigger::GetScaleCurveValue(const int & scaleCurve, uint32
    timeTo) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the scale value of an area trigger based on a scaling
    curve and time progression.
  description: The GetScaleCurveValue method retrieves the current scale factor of
    an area trigger by evaluating a specified scaling curve at a given time point.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft triggers that dynamically change size
    over time, such as spell effects or environmental area triggers. The method takes
    a curve identifier and a time value to determine how the trigger's scale should
    be interpolated or calculated. It is typically called during the update loop of
    area triggers to ensure smooth scaling transitions. The returned float represents
    the current scale multiplier applied to the area trigger's dimensions.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleCurve
    description: An integer identifier referencing a specific scaling curve defined
      in the database or game assets. This curve determines how the scale evolves
      over time.
  - name: timeTo
    description: A uint32 value representing the time point (in milliseconds or game
      ticks) at which to evaluate the scaling curve. Used to determine the current
      scale factor.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated scale factor for the area trigger
    at the specified time. A value of 1.0 indicates normal size, while values less
    than 1.0 indicate shrinking and greater than 1.0 indicate growing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get current scale
    code: float currentScale = areaTrigger->GetScaleCurveValue(5, 1000); // Get scale
      at 1 second for curve 5
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in area trigger update loop
    code: "void AreaTrigger::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    float scale = GetScaleCurveValue(GetScaleCurveId(),\
      \ GetTimeElapsed());\n    SetScale(scale);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-defined scaling curves stored in the database or
    game assets. The actual curve data must be valid and properly configured for accurate
    results. The time value should typically represent elapsed time since the trigger
    was activated.
  warnings: Ensure that the scaleCurve parameter references a valid curve definition,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Be cautious when using large time values
    as they might cause unexpected scaling behaviors if not handled properly in the
    underlying curve implementation.
