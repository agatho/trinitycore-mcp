documentation:
  brief: Generates combo points for the assassination rogue player
  description: The GenerateComboPoints method is responsible for creating and adding
    combo points to an assassination rogue class player. This method typically gets
    invoked when the rogue performs actions that contribute to building combo points,
    such as melee attacks or specific abilities. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this method likely updates internal state variables tracking
    the rogue's current combo point count and may trigger visual feedback or associated
    gameplay effects. The amount of combo points generated is determined by the input
    parameter 'amount'. This method is part of the core gameplay mechanics for rogue
    specialization, particularly focusing on the assassination tree which heavily
    relies on combo points for powerful finishers.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of combo points to generate and add to the rogue's current
      combo point total. Valid values are typically positive integers representing
      the quantity of combo points earned from an action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to generate 1 combo point
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating multiple combo points at once
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(5); // Generates 5 combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's internal combo point tracking
    system and may be called from various combat actions. It is important to ensure
    that the amount parameter does not exceed maximum allowed combo points (typically
    5) to prevent game balance issues.
  warnings: Improper handling of combo point generation can lead to incorrect gameplay
    behavior, such as combo points exceeding the maximum limit or being generated
    without proper action context.
