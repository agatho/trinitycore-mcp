  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetGOTargetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the game object target associated
    with the spell cast.
  description: The GetGOTargetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    of the game object that serves as the target for a spell being cast. This method
    is typically used in the context of spell casting mechanics where a spell targets
    a specific game object such as a door, chest, or interactive environment element.
    The returned GUID can be used to identify and interact with the target object
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method assumes that a game object target
    has been previously set for the spell cast targets structure, otherwise it may
    return an invalid or default GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the game object
    target. A value of 0 typically indicates no valid target was set, while positive
    integers represent valid game object identifiers within the server's object registry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell target
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set up spell targets ...\nint goGuid\
      \ = targets.GetGOTargetGUID();\nif (goGuid > 0)\n{\n    // Process the game\
      \ object target\n    GameObject* go = ObjectAccessor::GetGameObject(*m_caster,\
      \ goGuid);\n    if (go)\n    {\n        // Perform action on target game object\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class which manages all targets
    for a spell cast. The GUID returned corresponds to the GameObject's entry in the
    server's object manager system. Ensure that the spell cast targets have been properly
    initialized with a game object target before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned GUID actually points
    to an existing GameObject. It is the caller's responsibility to verify that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid object in the world. Calling this method without setting
    a proper game object target may return 0 or an invalid identifier.
