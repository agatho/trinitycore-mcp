  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes instance coordination algorithms for a given group to improve performance
    and resource management.
  description: The OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms method is designed to enhance the
    efficiency of instance coordination within TrinityCore's group management system.
    This method analyzes the current state of a group's instance-related activities
    and applies optimization strategies to reduce overhead, improve synchronization,
    and ensure better resource utilization. It typically involves reorganizing group
    member data structures, adjusting instance timers, and streamlining communication
    protocols between group members and the instance manager. The optimization process
    may include removing redundant data entries, consolidating group actions, and
    ensuring that all group members are properly synchronized with the instance's
    current state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination algorithms need to
      be optimized. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group
      with active instance participation.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   InstanceCoordination::OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the instance management
    system during group transitions or when significant changes occur in group composition.
    Developers should be aware that this method may cause temporary performance overhead
    during execution as it reorganizes internal data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. This method modifies
    internal group state, so calling it during critical operations may lead to synchronization
    issues.
