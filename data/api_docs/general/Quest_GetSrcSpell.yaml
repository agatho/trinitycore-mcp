documentation:
  brief: Returns the source spell ID associated with the quest
  description: The GetSrcSpell method retrieves the unique identifier of the spell
    that initiated the quest. This is typically used to determine which spell triggered
    the quest's completion or to identify the source of a quest's objective. The method
    returns a uint32 value representing the spell ID, which can be used for various
    game mechanics such as checking if a specific spell was used to trigger a quest,
    or for handling quest-related events in the game logic. This method is commonly
    used in quest scripts and event handling code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the source spell ID as a uint32 value. This represents the unique
    identifier of the spell that triggered the quest, typically used to identify which
    spell was responsible for initiating the quest or its completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 spellId = quest->GetSrcSpell();\nif (spellId == 12345)\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle quest completion with specific spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the source of a quest. It's important to note that this value may
    be zero if no spell was used to trigger the quest, or if the quest was initiated
    through other means such as NPC interaction.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if the quest
    was not triggered by a spell. Also, some quests might have multiple source spells
    depending on how they were initiated.
