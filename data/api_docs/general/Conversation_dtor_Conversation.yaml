  signature: void Conversation::~Conversation()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Conversation object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the Conversation class is responsible for cleaning
    up all memory and resources allocated to a conversation instance. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated data, clearing internal references, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers remain. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, conversations are used to manage dialogue sequences between NPCs and
    players, often involving multiple steps and conditional branches. When a Conversation
    object is destroyed, it ensures that all related data structures are properly
    deallocated to prevent memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when
    a Conversation object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Destruction
    code: 'Conversation* conv = new Conversation();

      // ... use the conversation ...

      delete conv; // Triggers ~Conversation()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction via Scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    Conversation conv;\n    // ... use the conversation\
      \ ...\n} // ~Conversation() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, conversation
    objects are often managed through smart pointers or container classes that automatically
    handle destruction.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor directly unless you're implementing
    custom memory management. Calling ~Conversation() manually on an already destroyed
    object will lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the conversation
    are cleared before deletion to avoid dangling pointer issues.
