  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: CalculateManaRegen
  signature: float ResourceCalculator::CalculateManaRegen(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the mana regeneration rate for a player based on their
    current stats and state.
  description: The CalculateManaRegen method computes the rate at which a player's
    mana resource regenerates over time. This calculation takes into account various
    factors such as the player's class, level, intellect, spirit, equipped items,
    buffs, debuffs, and current game state. The method is typically invoked during
    periodic updates or when mana-related events occur. It returns a float value representing
    the amount of mana regenerated per second. This function is essential for maintaining
    accurate resource management in World of Warcraft-style gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which mana regeneration is being
      calculated. Must not be null and should represent a valid player entity within
      the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the mana regeneration rate in mana per second.
    Returns 0.0f if the player pointer is invalid or if no mana regeneration calculation
    can be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      float regenRate = ResourceCalculator::CalculateManaRegen(player);

      printf("Mana Regen Rate: %.2f mana/sec\n", regenRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerMana(Player* player) {\n    if (player && player->IsInWorld())\
      \ {\n        float manaRegen = ResourceCalculator::CalculateManaRegen(player);\n\
      \        player->AddManaRegen(manaRegen * 0.1f); // Assuming 100ms update interval\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving base mana regeneration,
    class-specific modifiers, spell effects, and item bonuses. It may cache results
    or perform optimizations to avoid repeated expensive computations. The implementation
    should handle edge cases such as players in combat, resting, or under specific
    debuffs that affect mana regeneration.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer passed is valid and points to an active player
    object within the game world. Passing a null or invalid pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should not be called during critical sections
    where thread safety is required unless proper synchronization mechanisms are in
    place.
