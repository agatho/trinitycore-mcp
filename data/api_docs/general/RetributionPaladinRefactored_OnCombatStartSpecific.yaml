  class: RetributionPaladinRefactored
  method: OnCombatStartSpecific
  signature: void RetributionPaladinRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat-specific behavior for a Retribution Paladin when entering
    combat.
  description: The OnCombatStartSpecific method is invoked when a Retribution Paladin
    enters combat, allowing the AI to perform initial setup and behavior configuration
    specific to the combat state. This method typically handles initialization of
    combat abilities, target selection logic, or any pre-combat preparation required
    for the paladin's retribution specialization. The method may also set up internal
    state variables or flags that track combat-related conditions. It is designed
    to be called once at the beginning of each combat encounter and should not be
    invoked repeatedly during ongoing combat.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the combat system. This parameter allows the method to determine which
      entity the paladin is engaging in combat with.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void RetributionPaladinRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(int* target)\n\
      {\n    // Initialize combat-specific variables\n    m_currentTarget = *target;\n\
      \    m_combatStartTime = getMSTime();\n    // Activate retribution abilities\n\
      \    DoCast(SPELL_JUDGMENT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Target Validation
    code: "void RetributionPaladinRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(int* target)\n\
      {\n    if (!target || *target < 0)\n        return;\n    \n    m_currentTarget\
      \ = *target;\n    m_combatState = COMBAT_STARTED;\n    \n    // Set up initial\
      \ combat stance\n    SetSheath(SHEATH_STATE_MELEE);\n    \n    // Apply combat\
      \ buffs\n    DoCast(SPELL_SEAL_OF_VENGEANCE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a creature enters
    combat mode. Developers should ensure that any combat initialization logic within
    this method does not rely on external state that might not be available during
    early combat stages. The target parameter may be null or invalid if the paladin
    is engaged in a special form of combat such as area-of-effect encounters.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain about the context
    and target validity. Improper handling of the target pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Avoid performing heavy computations in this method as it
    may be called frequently during combat transitions.
