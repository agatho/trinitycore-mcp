  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the shadow
    priest AI.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a ShadowPriestRefactored AI instance.
    This method iterates through all relevant abilities and spells that the shadow
    priest can cast, checking their current cooldown status and updating internal
    timers accordingly. It ensures that the AI respects game mechanics such as spell
    cooldowns, global cooldowns, and resource requirements before attempting to cast
    spells. The method is typically called during each AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate state information for decision-making processes.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    accurate cooldown tracking. It is recommended to call this method before any spell
    selection or casting decisions are made to maintain proper game state consistency.
