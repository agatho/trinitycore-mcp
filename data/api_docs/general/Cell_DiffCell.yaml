documentation:
  brief: Compares this cell with another cell to determine if they are different.
  description: The DiffCell method performs a comparison between the current Cell
    object and another Cell object to check whether they represent different locations
    or areas within the game world. This is commonly used in grid-based systems where
    cells define specific regions of the world map. The method typically compares
    cell coordinates or identifiers to determine if the two cells are distinct. It
    returns true if the cells differ, and false if they are identical. This functionality
    is essential for managing object placement, visibility updates, and spatial queries
    within TrinityCore's world system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current cell differs from the provided cell; otherwise,
    returns false if both cells are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cell Comparison
    code: 'Cell cell1(10, 20);

      Cell cell2(15, 25);

      bool result = cell1.DiffCell(cell2); // Returns true since coordinates differ'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Same Cell
    code: 'Cell cellA(5, 10);

      Cell cellB(5, 10);

      bool result = cellA.DiffCell(cellB); // Returns false since coordinates are
      identical'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used internally by TrinityCore's grid management system
    to efficiently track which cells have changed during updates. It assumes that
    cells are uniquely identified by their coordinates or other distinguishing properties.
