  method: GetAllMembers
  signature: int FormationManager::GetAllMembers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of all members within the formation.
  description: The GetAllMembers method returns the number of units currently registered
    in the FormationManager's formation. This method is typically used to determine
    how many creatures or players are part of a specific formation, which can be useful
    for managing group behavior, AI decision making, and ensuring proper formation
    maintenance. The returned value represents the total member count including the
    leader if one exists. This method does not modify any internal state and is read-only
    in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of members currently in the formation.
    Returns zero if the formation is empty or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check formation size
    code: "FormationManager* manager = ...;\nint memberCount = manager->GetAllMembers();\n\
      if (memberCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with formation-based logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using member count for AI decision making
    code: "FormationManager* manager = ...;\nint members = manager->GetAllMembers();\n\
      if (members >= 5)\n{\n    // Trigger group attack behavior\n}\nelse if (members\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Execute solo behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on the internal member list
    and should be efficient. It is safe to call from multiple threads as long as the
    FormationManager instance itself is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationManager instance is valid before calling this
    method, as calling it on a destroyed or uninitialized manager may result in undefined
    behavior. The returned count includes all members but does not distinguish between
    different types of units (e.g., players vs. creatures).
