  brief: Initializes a new MountInfo object with default values
  description: The MountInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the MountInfo
    class, setting up default state for mount-related data. This method is typically
    called when creating a new mount information structure to store and manage player
    mount data within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that all
    internal member variables are properly initialized to their default states, preventing
    undefined behavior when accessing mount properties. This initialization is crucial
    for maintaining data integrity in the game's mount system, particularly when dealing
    with player-specific mount collections and display information.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MountInfo instance
    code: 'MountInfo myMount;

      // Initializes a new mount info object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when declaring a MountInfo variable.
    Developers should be aware that the default initialization sets all mount properties
    to their neutral/zero states, which may need to be overridden with actual mount
    data from the database or game state.
