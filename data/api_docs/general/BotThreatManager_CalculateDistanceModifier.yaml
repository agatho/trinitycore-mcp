  class: BotThreatManager
  method: CalculateDistanceModifier
  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateDistanceModifier(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a threat distance modifier based on the target unit's
    position relative to the bot.
  description: The CalculateDistanceModifier method computes a scalar value that represents
    how distance affects threat generation or perception for a bot AI. This modifier
    is typically used in threat calculations to adjust the effectiveness of attacks
    or abilities based on the proximity of the target. The method likely takes into
    account factors such as the bot's current position, the target's position, and
    predefined thresholds or ranges that define how distance impacts threat. It may
    be part of a larger threat management system within the BotThreatManager class,
    which handles AI behavior related to targeting and engagement mechanics in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated distance modifier. This value
    is typically used to scale threat generation or perception; higher values may
    indicate stronger threat influence from closer targets, while lower values might
    represent reduced impact from distant targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in threat calculation
    code: 'float modifier = botThreatManager->CalculateDistanceModifier(targetUnit);

      float finalThreat = baseThreat * modifier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the BotThreatManager to dynamically
    adjust threat behavior based on spatial relationships. The exact formula or logic
    behind the calculation is not specified, but it's expected to be consistent with
    WoW's combat system mechanics.
