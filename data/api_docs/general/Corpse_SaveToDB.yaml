documentation:
  brief: Saves corpse data to the database
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the current state of a Corpse object to
    the database. This method is typically invoked when a player dies and their corpse
    needs to be stored in the database for later retrieval or cleanup. The method
    handles writing all relevant corpse properties such as position, orientation,
    equipment, and time of death to the appropriate database tables. It ensures that
    corpse data remains synchronized with the game world state and allows for proper
    corpse management during player resurrection or automatic cleanup processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse saving
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->SaveToDB();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the corpse is in a valid state for
    database persistence. The method performs database operations and may block briefly
    during I/O. It's typically called automatically by the core system during player
    death or manual corpse cleanup processes.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized corpse object can lead
    to undefined behavior or database corruption. Ensure that the corpse has valid
    data before calling this method.
