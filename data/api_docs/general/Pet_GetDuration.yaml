  class: Pet
  method: GetDuration
  signature: int32 Pet::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the duration in milliseconds of the pet's current state or summoning
    effect.
  description: The GetDuration method retrieves the remaining time duration for a
    pet's active state, such as a summoned creature or temporary buff. This value
    is typically used to determine how much time remains before the pet disappears
    or its effects expire. The returned value represents milliseconds and can be zero
    if the pet has no active duration or has expired. In World of Warcraft context,
    this is commonly used for summoned pets, guardian spells, or temporary creature
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the remaining duration in milliseconds. A value
    of 0 indicates that the pet's duration has expired or is not applicable. Negative
    values may indicate an error condition or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pet Duration Before Action
    code: "if (Pet* pet = player->GetPet()) {\n    int32 duration = pet->GetDuration();\n\
      \    if (duration > 0) {\n        // Pet is still active, proceed with action\n\
      \        printf(\"Pet has %d ms remaining\\n\", duration);\n    } else {\n \
      \       // Pet has expired or is inactive\n        printf(\"Pet duration expired\\\
      n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal pet state tracking and may return inaccurate
    values if the pet's duration is not properly initialized or managed. The value
    returned should be interpreted in context of the pet's current behavior, such
    as whether it's a summoned creature or a temporary effect.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always means the pet is active;
    verify the pet's state through other methods like IsAlive() or IsInWorld(). Also,
    be cautious when using this value in time-sensitive operations, as it may change
    between calls if the pet's duration is decreasing.
