  method: HandleGroupWipe
  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleGroupWipe()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the cleanup and notification process when a group wipe occurs in
    a World of Warcraft instance.
  description: The HandleGroupWipe method is responsible for managing the aftermath
    of a group wipe event within TrinityCore's GroupCoordination system. When a group
    fails to complete a dungeon or raid encounter, this method ensures proper cleanup
    of group members, resets relevant timers and cooldowns, and broadcasts appropriate
    notifications to all players in the group. It also handles the transition of players
    back to their previous locations or designated respawn points. This method is
    typically invoked automatically by the core when a wipe condition is detected,
    ensuring that the game state remains consistent and players are properly managed
    during group failures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic invocation during group wipe
    code: "void SomeGroupHandler::OnWipeDetected()\n{\n    // This method would be\
      \ called internally by the core\n    // when a wipe is detected in the group\n\
      \    sGroupCoordination->HandleGroupWipe();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    upon detection of a group wipe event. It assumes that all necessary preconditions
    for a wipe have already been validated. The method performs cleanup operations
    and may modify player states, so it should not be invoked directly from external
    systems without proper context.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you are certain about the game
    state and wipe conditions. Improper invocation can lead to inconsistent group
    states or unexpected behavior for players in the group.
