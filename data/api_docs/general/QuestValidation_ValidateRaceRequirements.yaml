  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateRaceRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateRaceRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the race requirements for a given quest
  description: The ValidateRaceRequirements method checks if the specified player
    character's race is allowed to take on the quest identified by the provided quest
    ID. This validation ensures that quests with race-specific restrictions are only
    available to players of the correct race as defined in the game's quest database.
    The method performs a lookup against internal quest data and returns true if the
    player's race is permitted, or false otherwise. This function is typically used
    during quest acceptance or availability checks within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate race requirements
      for. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose race
      will be validated against the quest's requirements. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's race is allowed to accept the quest, false
    if the player's race does not meet the quest's race requirements or if the quest
    has no race restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateRaceRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot accept the quest due to race restrictions\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the race requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || !sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId))\n        return false;\n    \n\
      \    // Validate race requirements first\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateRaceRequirements(questId,\
      \ player))\n        return false;\n    \n    // Additional validation logic\
      \ can follow...\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest template data and assumes that race
    restrictions are properly defined in the database. The player object must be fully
    initialized with valid race information. Performance is generally low impact as
    it performs a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an existing quest in
    the database, otherwise behavior may be undefined. The bot parameter must not
    be null or the method will likely crash or produce incorrect results.
