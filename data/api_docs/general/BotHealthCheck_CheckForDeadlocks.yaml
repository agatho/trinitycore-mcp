documentation:
  brief: Checks for potential deadlocks in bot systems and logs warnings if detected.
  description: The CheckForDeadlocks method performs a diagnostic check to identify
    potential deadlock conditions within the bot management system. It evaluates the
    current state of active bots, their resource usage, and execution flow to detect
    scenarios that could lead to system hangs or performance degradation. This method
    is typically invoked periodically by the game server's health monitoring system
    to ensure stable operation of automated player characters (bots). The implementation
    may track thread locks, resource contention, or execution timeouts to determine
    if any bot processes are stuck in an unrecoverable state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Health Monitoring
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    botHealthCheck.CheckForDeadlocks(getMSTime());\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking during execution.
    It should not interfere with normal game operations or bot behavior. The diagnostic
    results are typically logged for administrative review rather than causing immediate
    system intervention.
  warnings: The method only detects potential deadlocks and does not automatically
    resolve them. If frequent deadlock warnings are logged, it may indicate a deeper
    issue in the bot AI implementation or resource management that requires investigation.
