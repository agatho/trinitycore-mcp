documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the hash value of the ConditionId instance for use
    in hash-based data structures.
  description: The GetHash method computes a unique hash value for the ConditionId
    object, which is typically used in hash tables or other hash-based collections
    to quickly locate or compare condition identifiers. This implementation likely
    uses a combination of the condition's properties to generate a consistent hash
    code that can be used for efficient lookup operations. The hash function ensures
    that identical ConditionId objects produce the same hash value, while different
    objects should ideally produce distinct hashes to minimize collisions. In the
    context of TrinityCore's condition system, this method supports fast retrieval
    and management of conditions within various subsystems such as quest requirements,
    NPC gossip options, or item interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::size_t value representing the computed hash of the ConditionId instance.
    This value can be used as a key in hash-based containers like std::unordered_map
    or std::unordered_set to enable fast lookups and comparisons of condition identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Hash Table
    code: 'ConditionId condition(12345);

      std::unordered_map<ConditionId, std::string> conditions;

      conditions[condition] = "Quest Requirement";

      std::size_t hash = condition.GetHash();

      // Use hash for debugging or performance monitoring

      std::cout << "Condition hash: " << hash << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hash for Condition Lookup
    code: "ConditionId targetCondition(67890);\nstd::unordered_set<ConditionId> activeConditions;\n\
      activeConditions.insert(targetCondition);\n\n// Later, check if condition exists\
      \ using hash\nauto it = activeConditions.find(targetCondition);\nif (it != activeConditions.end())\
      \ {\n    std::size_t hash = targetCondition.GetHash();\n    // Hash can be used\
      \ for logging or performance tracking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The hash calculation should remain consistent across multiple calls for the
    same ConditionId object. This method is typically called internally by STL containers
    when inserting or looking up elements, but may also be used explicitly for debugging
    or performance analysis purposes. The implementation likely uses a combination
    of member variables to compute the hash, ensuring that logically equivalent conditions
    produce identical hash values.
  warnings: Do not rely on the specific value returned by GetHash for external identification,
    as it may change between different builds or versions of TrinityCore. The hash
    value is primarily intended for internal use in hash-based data structures and
    should not be used for persistent storage or network communication where stable
    identifiers are required.
