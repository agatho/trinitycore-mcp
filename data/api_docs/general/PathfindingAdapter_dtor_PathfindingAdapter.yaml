  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::~PathfindingAdapter()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PathfindingAdapter instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PathfindingAdapter class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of PathfindingAdapter goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's pathfinding system, this typically involves releasing
    navigation mesh data, internal buffers, or other memory structures that support
    AI movement calculations for creatures and NPCs. The destructor is automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime and should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PathfindingAdapter
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PathfindingAdapter adapter;\n    // Use adapter\
      \ for pathfinding operations\n    // When function exits, adapter's destructor\
      \ is automatically called\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern used throughout TrinityCore. It ensures that pathfinding resources are
    properly cleaned up even if exceptions occur during object usage. Developers should
    not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns.
