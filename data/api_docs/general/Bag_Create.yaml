  class: Bag
  method: Create
  signature: bool Bag::Create(int guidlow, int itemid, int context, const int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bag instance with specified GUID, item ID, and context.
  description: 'The Create method initializes a Bag object by setting its unique identifier
    (GUID), associated item template ID, and context. This method is typically used
    during the creation or spawning of bag items in the game world. It ensures that
    the bag is properly configured with necessary metadata before being added to an
    inventory or world object. The method returns true if initialization was successful,
    false otherwise. Precondition: All parameters must be valid; owner parameter may
    be null if no specific owner is assigned.'
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: The low part of the unique identifier (GUID) for this bag instance.
      Must be a positive integer representing a valid object ID in the game world.
  - name: itemid
    description: The item template ID that defines the type and properties of the
      bag. This must correspond to a valid entry in the item_template database table.
  - name: context
    description: Context information for this bag, such as loot context or container
      type. Used to determine how the bag behaves within the game system.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the GUID of the owner of this bag. Can be null if no specific
      owner is assigned at creation time.
  returns: True if the bag was successfully initialized with the provided parameters;
    false if initialization failed due to invalid input or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bag Creation
    code: "Bag* newBag = new Bag();\nif (newBag->Create(12345, 10940, 0, nullptr))\
      \ {\n    // Bag created successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle creation failure\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bag Creation with Owner
    code: "uint64 ownerGuid = 98765;\nBag* newBag = new Bag();\nif (newBag->Create(12345,\
      \ 10940, 1, &ownerGuid)) {\n    // Bag created with owner\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle creation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not automatically add the bag to any inventory or world
    object. It only initializes internal state. The caller is responsible for managing
    the lifecycle of the created Bag instance.
  warnings: Do not call Create on an already initialized Bag object without first
    calling Destroy or similar cleanup methods. Passing invalid item IDs or GUIDs
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
