  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: PredictQuestCompletionTime
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::PredictQuestCompletionTime(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the estimated time required for a bot player to complete a specified
    quest.
  description: The PredictQuestCompletionTime method calculates and stores an estimated
    completion time for a given quest based on the bot's current progress, quest difficulty,
    and other relevant factors. This method is typically used in dynamic quest systems
    where bots need to make decisions about quest prioritization or resource allocation.
    The prediction takes into account various game mechanics such as quest rewards,
    required actions, and player capabilities. It updates internal tracking data structures
    within the DynamicQuestSystem to reflect this estimated time for future reference.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the completion time
      is being predicted. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will complete
      the quest. This player must be initialized and have valid data for accurate
      prediction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Initialized bot player

      questSystem.PredictQuestCompletionTime(12345, myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Management
    code: "void UpdateBotQuestPriorities(Player* bot) {\n    std::vector<uint32> questList\
      \ = GetAvailableQuests(bot);\n    DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;\n    \n  \
      \  for (uint32 questId : questList) {\n        questSystem.PredictQuestCompletionTime(questId,\
      \ bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state within the DynamicQuestSystem class.
    It assumes that the provided Player object has valid quest data and is properly
    initialized. The prediction algorithm considers multiple factors including quest
    level requirements, item collection needs, NPC interactions, and combat encounters.
    For performance reasons, this method should not be called excessively in tight
    loops.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or null bot pointer may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the quest exists in the database
    before calling this method. The prediction accuracy depends on the completeness
    of the bot's current quest data and state information.
