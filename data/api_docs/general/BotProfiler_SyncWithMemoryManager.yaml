  class: BotProfiler
  method: SyncWithMemoryManager
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithMemoryManager()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the bot profiler's internal state with the memory manager to
    ensure accurate profiling data collection.
  description: The SyncWithMemoryManager method aligns the bot profiler's tracking
    mechanisms with the underlying memory management system. This synchronization
    is crucial for maintaining accurate profiling metrics, particularly when monitoring
    memory allocation patterns and resource usage by AI-controlled bots in World of
    Warcraft. The method ensures that any changes or updates in the memory manager
    are properly reflected in the profiler's data structures, preventing discrepancies
    between actual memory consumption and recorded profiling statistics. It typically
    runs during initialization phases or when memory management policies change.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic synchronization call
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithMemoryManager();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any significant changes to the memory
    manager's configuration or when initializing new bot instances. It may involve
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in performance-critical sections might
    introduce overhead. Ensure it's only invoked when necessary to maintain accurate
    profiling data.
