documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify profitable item flipping opportunities within
    a specified investment limit
  description: The FindFlipOpportunities method scans the in-game auction house and
    market data to locate items that can be purchased at a lower price and sold at
    a higher price for profit. It evaluates potential profit margins, transaction
    costs, and market trends to recommend optimal flipping strategies. The method
    respects the provided maximum investment limit, ensuring that recommended opportunities
    do not exceed this budget constraint. This functionality is particularly useful
    for players seeking to maximize their gold earnings through strategic item trading
    within the World of Warcraft economy.
  parameters:
  - name: maxInvestment
    description: The maximum amount of gold the player is willing to invest in a single
      flipping opportunity. This value determines which potential trades are considered
      viable based on their upfront cost.
  returns: Returns the number of profitable flip opportunities found and recommended
    by the analysis. A return value of zero indicates no viable opportunities were
    identified within the given constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint opportunities = analyzer.FindFlipOpportunities(100000);\
      \ // 100g max investment\nif (opportunities > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d profitable\
      \ flipping opportunities\\n\", opportunities);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Profit Threshold
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nuint32 maxInvest = 500000; // 500g investment\
      \ limit\nint count = analyzer.FindFlipOpportunities(maxInvest);\nif (count >\
      \ 0) {\n    printf(\"Identified %d potential flips with up to %ug investment\\\
      n\", count, maxInvest / 10000);\n    // Additional logic to process and execute\
      \ recommended trades\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs intensive data processing on auction house listings
    and market trends. It may cache results or require sufficient system resources
    for large datasets. The actual profit calculations consider transaction fees,
    auction house cut, and market volatility factors.
  warnings: The method's performance may degrade with very large datasets or when
    the game server is under heavy load. Results are only as accurate as the current
    market data available in the auction house API. Users should verify recommended
    opportunities before executing trades.
