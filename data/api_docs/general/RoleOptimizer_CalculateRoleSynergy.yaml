  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: CalculateRoleSynergy
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::CalculateRoleSynergy(const int & assignments, const
    int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the synergy score for a given role assignment among players in
    a group.
  description: The CalculateRoleSynergy method computes a float value representing
    how well a specific role assignment aligns with the overall group composition
    and player capabilities. This function is typically used within TrinityCore's
    group management and raid optimization systems to determine optimal role distributions
    for maximizing performance. The synergy score takes into account factors such
    as player class, specialization, gear level, and role requirements. It returns
    a value between 0.0 (no synergy) and 1.0 (perfect synergy), where higher values
    indicate better role assignments. This method is crucial for automated group balancing
    systems in raid encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: An integer representing the current role assignments for players
      in a group, encoded as a bitmask or bitfield value that specifies which roles
      are assigned to which players.
  - name: players
    description: An integer representing the total number of players in the group,
      used to normalize the synergy calculation and determine valid assignment combinations.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the calculated role synergy
    score. A value of 0.0 means no synergy exists between the role assignments and
    player capabilities, while a value of 1.0 indicates perfect role alignment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Synergy Calculation
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      int assignments = 0b1010; // Example bitmask for role assignments

      int players = 4;

      float synergy = optimizer.CalculateRoleSynergy(assignments, players);

      std::cout << "Synergy Score: " << synergy << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing Group Roles
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint assignments = 0b1111; // All players assigned\
      \ roles\nint players = 5;\nfloat score = optimizer.CalculateRoleSynergy(assignments,\
      \ players);\nif (score > 0.8f) {\n    std::cout << \"Optimal role distribution\
      \ detected.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Consider rebalancing\
      \ roles for better synergy.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger optimization system that dynamically
    adjusts player roles during group encounters. The implementation may involve complex
    algorithms that consider multiple factors beyond simple role assignments, such
    as player stats, gear scores, and encounter requirements. It's designed to be
    called frequently during raid encounters for real-time role adjustments.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing invalid values for
    assignments or players could lead to incorrect synergy calculations. The internal
    bit manipulation logic should not be relied upon directly without understanding
    the underlying encoding scheme used for role assignments.
