documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Loot object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Loot destructor is automatically called when a Loot object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of all internal
    data structures, including item entries, loot templates, and any dynamically allocated
    memory. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method handles
    the cleanup of loot data that was generated during creature kills, quest rewards,
    or other loot-generating events. The destructor is essential for preventing memory
    leaks and maintaining game stability when managing temporary loot containers.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Loot object
    code: "void ProcessLoot() {\n    Loot* loot = new Loot();\n    // ... populate\
      \ loot ...\n    delete loot; // Triggers ~Loot()\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot object going out of scope
    code: "Loot GetCreatureLoot(uint32 creatureId) {\n    Loot loot;\n    // ... fill\
      \ loot ...\n    return loot; // ~Loot() called automatically when returning\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to understand that while the destructor handles
    cleanup, it does not directly interact with the game world state - that is managed
    by other systems such as the loot manager or database handlers.
