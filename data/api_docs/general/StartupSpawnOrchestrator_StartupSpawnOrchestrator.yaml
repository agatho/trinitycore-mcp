  brief: Initializes and starts the startup spawn orchestrator for managing creature
    and game object spawning during server startup.
  description: The StartupSpawnOrchestrator::StartupSpawnOrchestrator method is responsible
    for initializing the system that handles the spawning of creatures, game objects,
    and other entities when the TrinityCore server begins its startup sequence. This
    method ensures that all necessary entities are properly registered and spawned
    in the correct order to maintain world consistency. It typically runs during the
    server initialization phase before the world is fully ready for player connections.
    The orchestrator manages the loading and placement of entities based on predefined
    spawn points, templates, and world state configurations.

    code: 'StartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.StartupSpawnOrchestrator();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during server startup and should
    not be invoked manually by external code. It may perform database queries to retrieve
    spawn data and coordinate with the MapManager to ensure proper entity placement.
