documentation:
  brief: Resets guild weekly and daily activity timers for members
  description: The ResetTimes method clears or resets the weekly and daily activity
    tracking timers for all guild members. This function is typically called when
    a new week begins or when resetting guild activity data. It updates internal guild
    member time tracking fields to reflect fresh start times for weekly and daily
    contributions, such as guild bank usage, quest completions, and other time-based
    guild activities. The method ensures that guild members can begin accumulating
    weekly achievements and benefits from scratch.
  parameters:
  - name: weekly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to reset weekly timers (true) or
      daily timers (false). When true, resets all weekly activity tracking for guild
      members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Weekly Guild Timers
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n\
      \    guild->ResetTimes(true); // Reset weekly timers\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Daily Guild Timers
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n\
      \    guild->ResetTimes(false); // Reset daily timers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the game server during weekly
    reset events. Developers should not call this method manually unless implementing
    custom guild time tracking logic. The method modifies internal member data structures
    and may affect guild member benefits that depend on time-based activity.
  warnings: Calling ResetTimes with incorrect parameter values can lead to inconsistent
    guild member tracking. This function should only be called during appropriate
    reset intervals to maintain game balance and prevent exploitation of time-based
    guild mechanics.
