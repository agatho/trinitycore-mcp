  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: HandleStateTransition
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::HandleStateTransition(BotAIState oldState, BotAIState
    newState)
documentation:
  brief: Handles state transitions for the enhanced bot AI, updating internal behavior
    based on current and target states.
  description: The HandleStateTransition method manages the transition logic between
    different AI states within the EnhancedBotAI class. It is responsible for executing
    appropriate actions when the bot's AI state changes from one to another, such
    as initializing new behaviors, cleaning up previous state resources, or triggering
    specific event handlers. This method ensures that the bot's behavior remains consistent
    with its current operational mode and maintains proper synchronization between
    internal AI systems and external game events. The method typically gets invoked
    automatically by the AI framework when state changes occur, but may also be called
    manually in special circumstances to force a transition.
  parameters:
  - name: oldState
    description: The previous AI state that the bot is transitioning away from. This
      parameter defines the starting point for the state change logic.
  - name: newState
    description: The target AI state that the bot is transitioning to. This parameter
      determines what actions and behaviors should be activated in the new state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition Example
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnStateChanged(BotAIState oldState, BotAIState newState)\n\
      {\n    HandleStateTransition(oldState, newState);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Forced State Transition
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::ForceIdleState()\n{\n    HandleStateTransition(currentState,\
      \ BOT_AI_STATE_IDLE);\n    currentState = BOT_AI_STATE_IDLE;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework and should
    not be invoked directly unless implementing custom state management logic. The
    implementation may include logging or debugging information to track state changes
    for troubleshooting purposes.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper state validation might
    lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent bot operation. Ensure that all necessary
    cleanup is performed in the old state before transitioning to the new one.
