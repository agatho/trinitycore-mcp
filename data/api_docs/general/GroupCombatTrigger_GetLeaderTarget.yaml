  signature: Unit * GroupCombatTrigger::GetLeaderTarget(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit of the group leader.
  description: The GetLeaderTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit that the group
    leader is currently targeting. This is commonly used in group-based AI behaviors
    where the group needs to react to or follow the leader's current target. The method
    takes a Group object as input and retrieves the target from the group leader's
    current target state. If the group leader has no target or if the group is invalid,
    the method may return nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that the group leader is currently targeting, or
    nullptr if no valid target exists or the group leader is not in a valid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group leader's target
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    Unit* target = GroupCombatTrigger::GetLeaderTarget(group);\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        // Process the target\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Group leader is targeting: %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Group leader has no target.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group leader is a valid Unit and that the group
    is properly initialized. It does not perform any validation on the group itself,
    so calling this method with an invalid group may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and that
    the group leader exists before calling this method. Calling GetLeaderTarget on
    a group without a leader or with an invalid leader state can result in a nullptr
    return or potential crash.
