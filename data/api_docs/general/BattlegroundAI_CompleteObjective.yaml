  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: CompleteObjective
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::CompleteObjective(int * player, const BGObjective
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a battleground objective for the specified player and returns true
    if successful.
  description: The CompleteObjective method is used within the BattlegroundAI class
    to mark a specific battleground objective as completed for a given player. This
    method typically handles the logic required to progress the state of an objective,
    such as capturing a flag or completing a quest within the battleground. It ensures
    that the objective's completion is properly registered and can trigger subsequent
    events or rewards. The method requires a pointer to a player identifier and a
    reference to the objective being completed. It returns true if the objective was
    successfully completed, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for
    maintaining the integrity of battleground mechanics and ensuring proper progression
    through objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID)
      who is completing the objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a BGObjective object that represents the specific battleground
      objective being completed.
  returns: Returns true if the objective was successfully completed for the specified
    player, false otherwise. The method may return false if the player is invalid,
    the objective is already completed, or if the completion conditions are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CompleteObjective
    code: "if (bgAI->CompleteObjective(&playerGUID, objective)) {\n    // Objective\
      \ completed successfully\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Objective completed!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CompleteObjective with error handling
    code: "int playerGUID = 12345;\nBGObjective* obj = bg->GetObjective(0);\nif (obj\
      \ && bgAI->CompleteObjective(&playerGUID, *obj)) {\n    // Handle successful\
      \ completion\n    obj->SetCompleted(true);\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Failed to complete objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground events or when a player
    interacts with an objective. It's important that the player GUID passed is valid
    and corresponds to an active player in the battleground. The BGObjective reference
    must be a valid object within the battleground context. This method does not directly
    send messages or update UI; it only handles the internal state change of the objective.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an actual player
    in the battleground before calling this method. Passing an invalid player GUID
    may lead to undefined behavior. Also, make sure the BGObjective reference is valid
    and not a dangling pointer.
