  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: RecordHeartbeat
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::RecordHeartbeat(uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records a heartbeat timestamp for bot health monitoring.
  description: The RecordHeartbeat method updates the internal tracking of the last
    recorded heartbeat time for a bot. This is typically used in conjunction with
    bot health checks to ensure that bots are actively running and responding to system
    events. The method stores the provided current time value, which can later be
    used to determine if a bot has become unresponsive or inactive. This mechanism
    is crucial for maintaining system stability and detecting potential issues with
    automated game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current timestamp value representing when the heartbeat was recorded.
      This should typically be a Unix timestamp or equivalent time value from the
      game's internal clock.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Heartbeat Recording
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();

      botHealthCheck->RecordHeartbeat(currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Heartbeat with Logging
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("bots", "Recording heartbeat for bot at time: %u", currentTime);

      botHealthCheck->RecordHeartbeat(currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the bot's update loop or
    during significant state changes. The stored timestamp can be used in conjunction
    with timeout thresholds to detect inactive bots and trigger appropriate cleanup
    or alerting mechanisms.
