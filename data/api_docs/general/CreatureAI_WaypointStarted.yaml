documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature's waypoint movement is started, allowing custom AI
    behavior to be executed.
  description: The WaypointStarted method is a virtual callback function in the CreatureAI
    class that is invoked whenever a creature begins executing a waypoint path. This
    method allows developers to implement custom logic that should occur at the start
    of waypoint movement, such as setting initial states, triggering events, or modifying
    the creature's behavior. It is part of the AI system's event handling mechanism
    and provides an opportunity to react to the beginning of a creature's movement
    along a predefined path. The method does not require any parameters and does not
    return a value, making it suitable for side-effect operations within the AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void WaypointStarted(int\
      \ waypointId, int pathId) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when waypoint\
      \ movement starts\n        if (me->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n       \
      \     me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the execution of a creature's movement
    path. It should be used for initializing state or triggering events that are specific
    to the beginning of waypoint movement, not for continuous behavior updates. The
    method is part of the standard AI event flow and is invoked by the core engine
    when a creature begins following a path.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy computations or blocking operations in this method
    as it may impact performance. Avoid modifying the creature's movement directly
    from this callback unless absolutely necessary, as it could interfere with the
    waypoint system's internal state management.
