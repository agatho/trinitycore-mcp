  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: HandleEmergencySituation
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::HandleEmergencySituation()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the emergency situation protocol for combat specializations, triggering
    defensive mechanisms and cooldown resets.
  description: The HandleEmergencySituation method is a core component of the CombatSpecializationBase
    class that activates when a character enters a critical combat state. This method
    typically triggers defensive abilities, resets certain cooldowns, and applies
    temporary buffs or debuffs to help the player survive imminent threats. It's designed
    to be called automatically by the game engine during high-stress combat scenarios,
    such as when health drops below a threshold or when specific emergency conditions
    are met. The method may also update internal state tracking for specialization-specific
    behaviors and ensure synchronization with the client-side UI elements that display
    emergency status indicators.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyCombatSystem::OnLowHealth()\n{\n    // Trigger emergency situation\
      \ when player health drops critically\n    _combatSpecialization->HandleEmergencySituation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be invoked during active combat scenarios to prevent
    unintended behavior. It may modify internal cooldown timers and state flags, so
    calling it outside of combat context could cause synchronization issues with the
    player's ability system.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from non-combat contexts as it might
    interfere with normal ability cooldown management. The method assumes the player
    is in a valid combat state; calling it without proper setup may result in undefined
    behavior or client-side UI glitches.
