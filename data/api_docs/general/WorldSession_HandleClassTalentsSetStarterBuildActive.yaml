    & classTalentsSetStarterBuildActive)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active starter build for class talents in the WorldSession.
  description: This method handles the client request to activate or deactivate a
    starter build for class talents. It processes the incoming packet from the player's
    client and updates the session state accordingly. The method is part of the trait
    system implementation in TrinityCore, specifically managing how players can toggle
    between different starter builds for their character's class talents. This functionality
    allows players to quickly switch between predefined talent configurations without
    having to manually reconfigure their talents each time.
  parameters:
  - name: classTalentsSetStarterBuildActive
    description: A packet containing the data about which starter build to activate
      or deactivate. The packet includes information about the build ID and activation
      state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activating a Starter Build
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      WorldPackets::Traits::ClassTalentsSetStarterBuildActive packet;

      packet.BuildID = 12345;

      packet.IsActive = true;

      session->HandleClassTalentsSetStarterBuildActive(packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with the class talent
    interface in the UI. The implementation likely updates internal session state
    and may trigger synchronization packets to other players or systems that track
    talent builds.
