  method: _GetPurchasedTabsSize
  signature: uint8 Guild::_GetPurchasedTabsSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of guild tabs purchased by the guild.
  description: The _GetPurchasedTabsSize method retrieves the total count of guild
    tab slots that have been purchased for the guild. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, guilds can purchase additional tab slots beyond their default
    limit using in-game currency or other mechanisms. This method provides access
    to the current purchased tab size, which is used internally by the game to determine
    how many tabs are available for configuration and display. The value returned
    represents the actual number of tabs that have been unlocked through purchases,
    not including any default tabs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of purchased guild tab slots. This
    value is typically between 0 and a maximum defined by the game's configuration
    (usually 5 or more depending on server settings). Returns 0 if no additional tabs
    have been purchased.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = ...; // Assume guild object is obtained\nuint8 purchasedTabs\
      \ = myGuild->_GetPurchasedTabsSize();\nif (purchasedTabs > 0)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Guild has \" << static_cast<int>(purchasedTabs) << \" purchased tabs.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Tab Availability
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    uint8 maxTabs =\
      \ guild->_GetPurchasedTabsSize() + GUILD_DEFAULT_TABS; // Assuming GUILD_DEFAULT_TABS\
      \ is defined\n    std::cout << \"Total tabs available: \" << static_cast<int>(maxTabs)\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the guild system to manage tab
    configurations and ensure that players cannot access more tabs than they have
    purchased. The returned value should not be confused with the total number of
    tabs including default ones, which may be higher. This method is likely marked
    as private (_ prefix) indicating it's intended for internal use within the Guild
    class or related systems.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the guild object is valid or initialized
    before accessing its data. Calling this on a null guild pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Additionally, since this is a private method, direct usage
    outside of the Guild class may break encapsulation principles and could be subject
    to change in future versions.
