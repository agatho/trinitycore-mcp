  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: RecordRareKill
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::RecordRareKill(Creature * rare)
documentation:
  brief: Records a rare creature kill in the advanced behavior manager for tracking
    and reward distribution.
  description: The RecordRareKill method is used to log the successful elimination
    of a rare creature within the TrinityCore framework. This function typically updates
    internal tracking systems to monitor player achievements, quest progress, or loot
    distribution related to rare mobs. It may also trigger associated events such
    as quest completion, achievement unlocking, or reward granting. The method operates
    on a Creature pointer and assumes that the creature has already been killed and
    is being processed for post-kill actions. This functionality is integral to the
    game's behavioral systems and player engagement mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: rare
    description: A pointer to the Creature object representing the rare mob that was
      killed. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to a creature instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Kill Event
    code: "void OnCreatureKilled(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature->IsRare())\n\
      \    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->RecordRareKill(creature);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database systems to persist kill data and
    may involve thread-safe operations depending on how the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    is implemented. It's recommended that the Creature pointer passed is verified
    to be valid before calling this function.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Creature pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure proper validation of the input parameter before invoking this
    method.
