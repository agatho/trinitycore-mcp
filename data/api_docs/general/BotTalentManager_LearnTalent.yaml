  signature: bool BotTalentManager::LearnTalent(Player * bot, uint32 talentEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a specified talent to a bot player character.
  description: The LearnTalent method is responsible for granting a specific talent
    entry to a bot player character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    checks if the talent can be learned based on prerequisites such as required ranks
    in other talents, skill levels, and class-specific restrictions. It updates the
    bot's talent points and modifies the player's talent data accordingly. The method
    ensures that the talent is properly added to the bot's active talent tree and
    reflects in the character's visual and functional state within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will learn the talent. Must be a valid player instance with appropriate class
      and level.
  - name: talentEntry
    description: Unique identifier (ID) of the talent to be learned. This corresponds
      to the TalentId field in the dbc files or database entries for talents.
  returns: Returns true if the talent was successfully learned and applied to the
    bot, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to insufficient talent points, unmet
    prerequisites, invalid talent ID, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Talent Learning
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nuint32 fireballTalentId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = BotTalentManager::LearnTalent(myBot, fireballTalentId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Talent successfully learned\n    sLog->outString(\"Talent\
      \ learned successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to learn talent\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to learn talent\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Learning Multiple Talents
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nstd::vector<uint32> talentsToLearn = {1001, 1002, 1003};\n\
      for (uint32 talentId : talentsToLearn) {\n    if (!BotTalentManager::LearnTalent(bot,\
      \ talentId)) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Failed to learn talent ID: %u\", talentId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of bot AI systems and assumes that
    the bot has sufficient resources (talent points) to learn the specified talent.
    It interacts with internal talent validation logic and may trigger updates to
    the player's spellbook or ability bar. The implementation likely includes checks
    for class restrictions, level requirements, and prerequisite talent dependencies.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player character may lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and represents an actual
    AI-controlled character. Also, be aware that learning certain talents might have
    cascading effects on other related talents or abilities in the bot's talent tree.
