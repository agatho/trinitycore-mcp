documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new evolutionary optimizer with the specified population size
  description: The EvolutionaryOptimizer constructor initializes a new instance of
    the EvolutionaryOptimizer class with a given population size. This class is designed
    to implement evolutionary algorithms for optimization purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The population size determines how many candidate solutions are maintained
    in each generation during the evolutionary process. The method sets up internal
    data structures required for evolutionary operations such as selection, crossover,
    and mutation. This constructor should be called before any evolutionary operations
    are performed on the optimizer instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer(100);

      // Creates an optimizer with a population of 100 individuals'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "class AIController\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeOptimization()\n   \
      \ {\n        optimizer = new EvolutionaryOptimizer(50);\n        // Set up evolutionary\
      \ algorithm for NPC behavior optimization\n    }\nprivate:\n    EvolutionaryOptimizer*\
      \ optimizer;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The population size parameter directly affects memory usage and computational
    complexity. Larger populations generally provide better exploration of the solution
    space but require more resources. This implementation likely uses standard evolutionary
    operators like tournament selection, uniform crossover, and Gaussian mutation.
    The class may be used for optimizing AI behavior parameters, loot distribution
    weights, or other game balance factors.
  warnings: Ensure that the population size is reasonable for your system's memory
    constraints. Very large populations may cause performance degradation or memory
    allocation failures. This constructor does not validate the population size parameter,
    so invalid values (like zero) may lead to undefined behavior.
