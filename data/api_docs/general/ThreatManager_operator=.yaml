  class: ThreatManager
  method: operator=
  signature: ThreatManager & ThreatManager::operator=(const ThreatManager & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the threat data from another ThreatManager instance to this instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all threat-related data
    from the source ThreatManager object to the current ThreatManager object. This
    includes copying threat lists, threat values, and any associated targeting information.
    The method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of threat data,
    preventing unintended side effects when modifying either instance. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's AI system, this operation is crucial for maintaining accurate
    threat tracking during combat scenarios where mobs need to synchronize their target
    selection and threat levels.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source ThreatManager object whose threat data will be copied
      to this instance. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      ThreatManager with initialized threat data.
  returns: A reference to the current ThreatManager object (this), allowing for method
    chaining operations such as 'manager1 = manager2 = manager3'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'ThreatManager threat1;

      ThreatManager threat2;

      // ... populate threat2 with threat data ...

      threat1 = threat2; // Copies all threat data from threat2 to threat1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining Example
    code: 'ThreatManager managerA, managerB, managerC;

      // ... populate managers with threat data ...

      managerA = managerB = managerC; // Chains assignment operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large threat lists. The implementation ensures thread safety
    for read operations but does not guarantee atomicity during assignment, so concurrent
    access should be handled by external synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning ThreatManager objects that reference shared
    data structures, as this might lead to unexpected behavior if the underlying threat
    data is modified elsewhere. Avoid circular references between ThreatManager instances
    to prevent memory leaks or undefined behavior.
