  signature: uint32 Item::GetEnchantmentId(EnchantmentSlot slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the enchantment ID applied to a specific enchantment slot of the
    item.
  description: This method returns the unique identifier (ID) of an enchantment applied
    to a particular enchantment slot on the item. The enchantment ID represents the
    specific enchantment effect that is active on the item, and it corresponds to
    the enchantment entry in the game database. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine which enchantment is currently
    active on an item's enchantment slot, allowing for proper handling of item properties
    and effects during gameplay mechanics such as enchantment validation, item modification,
    or player interaction with enchanted items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the enchantment ID (uint32) of the specified enchantment slot.
    If no enchantment is applied to that slot, it returns 0, indicating an empty or
    invalid enchantment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(ITEM_SLOT_HEAD);\nuint32 enchantmentId\
      \ = item->GetEnchantmentId(ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_0);\nif (enchantmentId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the enchantment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other item-related methods to manage enchantments. It should be noted that
    the returned value may vary depending on whether the item has been enchanted or
    not, and it's important to validate the result before using it in gameplay logic.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can return 0 if no enchantment
    is applied to the slot, which might lead to incorrect assumptions about the item's
    state if not handled properly. Also, ensure that the EnchantmentSlot parameter
    is correctly specified to avoid retrieving wrong data.
