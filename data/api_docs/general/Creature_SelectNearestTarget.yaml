  class: Creature
  method: SelectNearestTarget
  signature: int * Creature::SelectNearestTarget(float dist, bool playerOnly) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects the nearest target within specified distance range.
  description: This method identifies and returns the GUID of the closest target creature
    or player within the given distance range. It is commonly used in AI behavior
    to determine target selection for hostile actions. The method considers both creature
    and player targets based on the 'playerOnly' parameter, with a default behavior
    that includes all valid targets within the specified distance.
  parameters:
  - name: dist
    description: The maximum distance range to search for targets. This parameter
      defines how far the method will scan for potential targets.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: When set to true, only player targets are considered; when false,
      both creature and player targets are included in selection criteria.
  returns: Returns the GUID of the nearest target within the specified distance range.
    If no valid targets exist within the range, it returns 0 or nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int targetGUID = creature->SelectNearestTarget(10.0f, false);\nif (targetGUID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Player-only selection example
    code: "int playerTarget = creature->SelectNearestTarget(25.0f, true);\nif (playerTarget\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Handle player target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scripts to determine which target to
    attack next. It performs a distance-based search and returns the first valid target
    found within the specified range. The method may be affected by map boundaries
    or other game mechanics that limit visibility.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    AI methods, as it may lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly. Ensure
    that the distance parameter is set appropriately for the intended use case.
