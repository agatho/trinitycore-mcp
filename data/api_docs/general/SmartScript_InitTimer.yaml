documentation:
  brief: Initializes a timer for a SmartScript event holder
  description: The InitTimer method prepares a SmartScriptHolder object for timer-based
    execution by setting up internal timer state and initialization values. This method
    is typically called during the setup phase of AI scripts to ensure that timer-based
    events are properly configured before the script begins executing. The method
    initializes various timer-related fields within the SmartScriptHolder structure,
    including elapsed time tracking and event scheduling parameters. It ensures that
    subsequent timer-based triggers will function correctly according to the defined
    timing rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Initialization
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder holder;

      // Configure holder with timer events

      holder.event_type = SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_OOC;

      holder.event_param1 = 1000; // 1 second interval

      holder.event_param2 = 2000; // 2 seconds max delay

      smartScript.InitTimer(holder);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any timer-based events are processed.
    The SmartScriptHolder must be properly configured with valid timer parameters
    before calling InitTimer. The method does not perform any validation of the input
    parameters, so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure proper setup.
  warnings: Calling InitTimer on an already initialized holder may cause unexpected
    behavior or timer conflicts. Ensure that all timer-related event parameters are
    correctly set before initialization. This method modifies internal state and should
    not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
