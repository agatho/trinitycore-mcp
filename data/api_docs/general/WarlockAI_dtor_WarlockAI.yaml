  signature: void WarlockAI::~WarlockAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WarlockAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~WarlockAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    allocated to a WarlockAI object. This includes releasing any dynamically allocated
    memory, canceling ongoing spell casts, and ensuring proper cleanup of AI state
    variables. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor ensures
    that when a warlock creature or NPC is removed from the game world, all its AI-related
    data structures are properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks. The destruction
    process also handles any necessary cleanup of internal AI state machines and event
    handlers.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction via Smart Pointer
    code: 'std::unique_ptr<WarlockAI> warlockAI = std::make_unique<WarlockAI>(creature);

      // Destructor automatically called when unique_ptr goes out of scope

      // All resources are properly cleaned up'
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Deletion in Legacy Code
    code: 'WarlockAI* warlockAI = new WarlockAI(creature);

      // ... AI logic here ...

      delete warlockAI; // Triggers destructor

      // All AI resources are released'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a WarlockAI object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called directly unless you're managing the object lifecycle manually.
    The AI system in TrinityCore handles most destruction automatically through smart
    pointers and object managers.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on stack-allocated WarlockAI objects,
    as this can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure proper object lifetime management
    using smart pointers or manual deletion patterns that match how the object was
    created.
