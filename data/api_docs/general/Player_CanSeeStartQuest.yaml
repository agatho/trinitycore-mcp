documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can accept a quest based on their current quest
    log status and requirements.
  description: The CanSeeStartQuest method checks if a player is eligible to begin
    a specific quest. It evaluates the player's current quest log state, including
    whether they have already accepted the quest, whether the quest prerequisites
    are met, and whether the quest is in the player's quest log. This method is crucial
    for determining quest availability and ensuring proper quest progression within
    the game. The function considers various factors such as quest completion status,
    level requirements, and prerequisite conditions to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can accept the quest, false otherwise. A return
    value of false indicates that the player cannot start the quest due to either
    having already accepted it, not meeting prerequisites, or other quest-related
    restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (player->CanSeeStartQuest(quest)) {\n    // Player can accept the quest\n\
      \    player->CompleteQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot accept the\
      \ quest\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related functions
    to determine quest availability. It's important to note that this function does
    not check if a player has completed the quest, only whether they can start it.
    The implementation involves checking the player's quest log status and various
    quest prerequisites.
  warnings: The method may return false even when a player meets all requirements
    if the quest has already been accepted by the player. This can lead to confusion
    if developers don't properly check for quest completion status before calling
    this function.
