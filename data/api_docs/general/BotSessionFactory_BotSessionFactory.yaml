documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotSessionFactory class
  description: The BotSessionFactory constructor initializes the factory object responsible
    for creating and managing bot sessions within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method sets up internal data structures and configurations needed to handle bot-related
    operations, including session management, configuration loading, and resource
    allocation. The constructor ensures that all necessary components are properly
    initialized before the factory can be used to create new bot sessions. It typically
    performs setup tasks such as initializing internal counters, loading default configurations,
    and preparing memory pools for bot session creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a BotSessionFactory instance
    code: 'BotSessionFactory factory;

      // The factory is now ready to create bot sessions

      BotSession* session = factory.CreateSession();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per factory instance. Multiple
    instantiations of the same factory may lead to resource conflicts or unexpected
    behavior. The constructor performs initialization tasks that are typically not
    thread-safe, so it should be called from a single-threaded context during application
    startup.
