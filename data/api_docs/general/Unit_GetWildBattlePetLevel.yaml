  signature: uint32 Unit::GetWildBattlePetLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the level of the unit's wild battle pet.
  description: This method retrieves the current level of the unit's wild battle pet,
    which is used in World of Warcraft's battle pet system. The level represents the
    strength and capabilities of the pet in combat scenarios. This value is typically
    determined by the pet's species and can be influenced by various game mechanics
    such as player level or random number generation during pet creation. The method
    is commonly used in battle pet related calculations and interactions within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the level of the wild battle pet. This value
    typically ranges from 1 to 100, depending on the pet's species and game mechanics.
    The exact range may vary based on game version and implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 level = unit->GetWildBattlePetLevel();\n// Use level in battle calculations\n\
      if (level > 0)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on pet level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Unit class and may be used in conjunction with
    other battle pet methods. Performance considerations include potential overhead
    when calling this method frequently during combat calculations. Thread safety
    depends on how the unit object is accessed, but generally should be safe if properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: This method may return 0 if no wild battle pet exists or if the pet has
    not been properly initialized. Care should be taken to ensure proper initialization
    before calling this method, especially in combat scenarios where pet level affects
    gameplay mechanics.
