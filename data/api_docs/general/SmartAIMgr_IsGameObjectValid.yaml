    entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a game object entry is valid within the SmartAI system
  description: The IsGameObjectValid method checks whether a given game object entry
    ID is recognized and valid for use within the SmartAI scripting system. This validation
    ensures that the script references to game objects are legitimate before execution,
    preventing errors from referencing non-existent or invalid game object entries.
    The method typically performs internal lookups against registered game object
    templates and may consider various factors such as object type, spawn status,
    and script compatibility. It's commonly used during SmartAI script initialization
    or execution to verify that referenced game objects are available and properly
    configured in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the script
      event data and context information for validation
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the game object to validate against
      the SmartAI system's registered objects
  returns: Returns true if the specified game object entry is valid and recognized
    by the SmartAI system, false otherwise. The method returns false when the entry
    does not correspond to any registered game object template or when the object
    fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "SmartScriptHolder scriptData;\nuint32 gameObjectEntry = 17890;\nif (sSmartAIMgr->IsGameObjectValid(scriptData,\
      \ gameObjectEntry)) {\n    // Proceed with SmartAI script execution\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Valid game object entry: %u\", gameObjectEntry);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ game object reference\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid game object entry: %u\"\
      , gameObjectEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in SmartAI Script Context
    code: "void MySmartAIScript::OnUpdate(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!sSmartAIMgr->IsGameObjectValid(m_scriptHolder,\
      \ m_gameObjectEntry)) {\n        // Log error and potentially disable script\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"SmartAI script failed - invalid GameObject entry %u\"\
      , m_gameObjectEntry);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with normal script\
      \ execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation against registered game object templates
    and may involve database lookups or cached data structures. It's designed to be
    efficient for frequent calls during SmartAI script execution, but performance
    can vary depending on the number of registered objects and system load.
  warnings: Using invalid game object entries in SmartAI scripts can lead to unexpected
    behavior or script failures. Always validate entries before using them in critical
    script logic. The method may return false for valid entries if they are not currently
    loaded or spawned in the world.
