documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mechanic type associated with a specific spell effect.
  description: This method returns the mechanic type of a spell effect at the specified
    index. The mechanic type determines how the spell interacts with various game
    mechanics, such as disorientation, immobilization, or crowd control effects. It
    is commonly used in spell handling and game logic to determine the nature of effects
    applied by spells. The method is part of the SpellInfo class which provides access
    to spell data information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the mechanic type of the specified spell
    effect. A value of 0 typically indicates no specific mechanic, while other values
    correspond to different mechanic types like 'sleep', 'stun', 'root', etc., depending
    on the spell's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      int mechanicType = spellInfo->GetEffectMechanic(0);

      // Returns the mechanic type for the first effect of spell 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell effect methods
    to determine how a spell's effects interact with game mechanics. It should be
    noted that the returned value may vary depending on the specific spell and effect
    index, and it is often used for determining whether certain effects are applicable.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as incorrect indexing can lead to invalid
    results or crashes. Ensure that the effect index is within valid bounds before
    calling this method.
