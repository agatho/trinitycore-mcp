  method: Execute3v3TripleDPS
  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute3v3TripleDPS(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 3v3 Triple DPS arena AI behavior for a specified player.
  description: The Execute3v3TripleDPS method implements the artificial intelligence
    logic specifically designed for 3v3 arena matches where the player is assigned
    a Triple DPS role. This method manages the AI's decision-making process, including
    target selection, ability usage, and positioning strategies tailored for high-damage
    output in a 3v3 arena environment. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    ArenaAI system and modifies the behavior of the specified player according to
    predefined arena tactics. The method assumes that the player is already participating
    in a 3v3 arena match and that the AI system has been initialized for this specific
    game mode.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter determines which player's AI behavior
      will be executed by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Execute3v3TripleDPS
    code: 'int playerIndex = 0;

      arenaAI->Execute3v3TripleDPS(&playerIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's arena AI subsystem and should only be
    called during active 3v3 arena matches. The player parameter must reference a
    valid player within the current arena team, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this method is designed to execute quickly
    during the game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active 3v3 arena match may result in
    incorrect AI behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player index passed is valid
    and corresponds to a player currently in the arena team.
