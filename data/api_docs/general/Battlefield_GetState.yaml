  class: Battlefield
  method: GetState
  signature: int Battlefield::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of the battlefield.
  description: The GetState method returns an integer value representing the current
    operational state of the battlefield instance. This state typically indicates
    whether the battlefield is in preparation, active, or inactive mode. The return
    value can be used by game logic to determine how to handle player interactions,
    quest updates, and reward distribution within the battlefield environment. The
    method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls during
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'An integer representing the current battlefield state. Common values include:
    0 (inactive), 1 (preparation), 2 (active), 3 (ended). Specific meanings may vary
    based on implementation details within the TrinityCore framework.'
  examples:
  - title: Check Battlefield State
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf != nullptr)\n{\n    int state = bf->GetState();\n    switch (state)\n\
      \    {\n        case 0:\n            // Battlefield is inactive\n          \
      \  break;\n        case 1:\n            // Battlefield is preparing\n      \
      \      break;\n        case 2:\n            // Battlefield is active\n     \
      \       break;\n        case 3:\n            // Battlefield has ended\n    \
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the battlefield management system to determine
    how to process player entries, exits, and rewards. The state values are usually
    defined as constants within the Battlefield class or related enums for better
    code readability.
