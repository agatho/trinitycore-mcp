  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: UpdateGridDanger
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::UpdateGridDanger(uint32 x, uint32 y, float
    dangerLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the danger level of a specified grid position within the world.
  description: The UpdateGridDanger method is used to modify or set the danger level
    associated with a specific grid coordinate in the game world. This functionality
    is typically employed by AI systems, pathfinding algorithms, or environmental
    hazard management to dynamically adjust how dangerous certain areas are for NPCs
    or players. The method accepts grid coordinates (x, y) and a danger level value
    that can influence decision-making processes such as movement, combat behavior,
    or threat assessment. It's part of the PositionStrategyBase class which handles
    positioning-related logic in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid position to update. Represents the horizontal
      axis in the world grid system.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid position to update. Represents the vertical
      axis in the world grid system.
  - name: dangerLevel
    description: A floating-point value representing the danger level at the specified
      grid position. Higher values typically indicate more dangerous areas, influencing
      NPC behavior and pathfinding decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = ...;

      strategy->UpdateGridDanger(100, 200, 5.0f); // Sets danger level to 5.0 at grid
      position (100, 200)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Danger Adjustment
    code: "void UpdateCombatZoneDanger(PositionStrategyBase* strategy, uint32 x, uint32\
      \ y, float newDanger)\n{\n    strategy->UpdateGridDanger(x, y, newDanger);\n\
      }\n\n// Usage:\nUpdateCombatZoneDanger(strategy, 50, 75, 10.0f); // Increase\
      \ danger in combat zone"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures used for pathfinding
    and AI decision-making. It may trigger updates to cached navigation data or invalidate
    certain pathfinding caches. The implementation should be thread-safe if called
    from multiple threads, though this is not explicitly stated.
  warnings: Modifying grid danger levels can affect NPC behavior significantly. Ensure
    that danger values are set appropriately to avoid unintended consequences such
    as NPCs avoiding safe zones or entering dangerous areas unnecessarily. Avoid frequent
    updates to the same grid positions to prevent performance degradation.
