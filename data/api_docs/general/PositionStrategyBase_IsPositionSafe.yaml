  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe for use in AI pathfinding or
    movement logic.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates whether a specified position is
    considered safe for NPC movement or AI behavior. It typically checks for environmental
    hazards, obstacles, or other conditions that would make the position unsuitable
    for character navigation. The method takes an integer parameter representing a
    position identifier or index and returns true if the position is deemed safe,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial in TrinityCore's AI systems to
    prevent NPCs from moving into dangerous areas or invalid locations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. The exact meaning of this value depends on the context of the PositionStrategyBase
      implementation, but it typically refers to a node index, waypoint number, or
      coordinate-based identifier used by pathfinding algorithms.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is safe for use in AI movement or
    pathfinding operations; returns false if the position is unsafe or invalid. A
    return value of false may indicate that the position is blocked, contains hazards,
    or otherwise unsuitable for NPC navigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a waypoint is safe
    code: "if (positionStrategy->IsPositionSafe(5)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ to waypoint 5\n    MoveToWaypoint(5);\n} else {\n    // Find an alternative\
      \ path\n    FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPositionSafe in a loop for path validation
    code: "std::vector<int> waypoints = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nfor (int waypoint : waypoints)\
      \ {\n    if (!positionStrategy->IsPositionSafe(waypoint)) {\n        // Skip\
      \ unsafe waypoints\n        continue;\n    }\n    // Process safe waypoint\n\
      \    ProcessWaypoint(waypoint);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger pathfinding or positioning system
    and may perform checks against collision data, terrain properties, or environmental
    state. The exact implementation details depend on the specific subclass of PositionStrategyBase
    being used.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this method corresponds
    to valid positions within the current context. Passing invalid indices could lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect safety assessments.
