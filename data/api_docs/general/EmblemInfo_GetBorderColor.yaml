  signature: uint32 EmblemInfo::GetBorderColor() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the border color ID associated with the emblem information.
  description: The GetBorderColor method returns the border color identifier for an
    emblem, which is typically used in World of Warcraft's guild and player emblems.
    This value corresponds to a predefined color index that determines how the emblem's
    border appears in the game interface. The returned uint32 value represents a specific
    color from the game's internal color palette and is often used when rendering
    or displaying emblems in UI elements such as guild tabs, player avatars, or achievement
    displays. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the border color ID of the emblem. This ID
    maps to a specific color in the game's color palette used for rendering the emblem's
    border in the user interface.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      uint32 borderColor = emblem.GetBorderColor();

      // Use borderColor to determine how to render the emblem''s border

      printf("Emblem border color ID: %u\n", borderColor);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Border Color for UI Rendering
    code: "void RenderGuildEmblem(Guild* guild)\n{\n    EmblemInfo emblem = guild->GetEmblemInfo();\n\
      \    uint32 borderColor = emblem.GetBorderColor();\n    // Apply the border\
      \ color to the emblem's rendering logic\n    ApplyColorToBorder(borderColor);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EmblemInfo class which encapsulates all data related
    to an emblem, including its background color, border color, and symbol. The returned
    border color ID should be used directly with the game's color handling system
    for proper rendering. This function is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable
    internal state.
