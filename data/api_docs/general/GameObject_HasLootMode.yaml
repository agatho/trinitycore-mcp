  class: GameObject
  method: HasLootMode
  signature: bool GameObject::HasLootMode(uint16 lootMode) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a game object has a specific loot mode enabled.
  description: This method checks if a GameObject instance has a particular loot mode
    set, which is used to control how loot is distributed among players. The loot
    mode is typically associated with the game object's loot table and determines
    the conditions under which players can receive loot items. This method is essential
    for managing loot distribution behavior in World of Warcraft instances and zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject has the specified loot mode set, false otherwise.
    The method does not return null or error values as it is a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameObject->HasLootMode(LOOT_MODE_DEFAULT)) {\n    // Loot mode is\
      \ enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with loot tables and requires
    proper understanding of the game object's loot system. It should be called during
    loot processing to ensure correct distribution behavior.
  warnings: This method does not validate the loot mode parameter; it simply checks
    if the specified loot mode is set, so care must be taken to use valid loot mode
    values from the game object's context.
