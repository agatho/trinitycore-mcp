  class: AuraEffect
  method: IsEffect
  signature: bool AuraEffect::IsEffect(int effectName) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the aura effect matches a specified effect type.
  description: The IsEffect method determines whether the current AuraEffect instance
    corresponds to a specific effect type identified by the provided effectName parameter.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to evaluate
    the nature of active auras on units, such as determining if an aura applies a
    damage over time effect or a healing buff. The method performs a comparison against
    predefined effect types and returns true if there is a match, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for implementing game mechanics that respond differently
    based on the type of aura affecting a unit.
  parameters:
  - name: effectName
    description: An integer identifier representing the effect type to check against.
      This value typically corresponds to predefined constants in the TrinityCore
      codebase such as SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE, SPELL_EFFECT_HEAL, etc., which
      define different aura effects.
  returns: Returns true if the AuraEffect's type matches the specified effectName;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for a Damage Over Time Effect
    code: "if (auraEffect->IsEffect(SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE))\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ damage over time aura\n    SendDamageOverTimeMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Aura Effect Type
    code: "AuraEffect const* auraEffect = unit->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE,\
      \ 0);\nif (auraEffect && auraEffect->IsEffect(SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE))\n\
      {\n    // Apply special handling for periodic damage effects\n    ApplyDamageReduction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal effect type enumeration values that must align
    with the spell system's definitions. Developers should ensure that the effectName
    parameter corresponds to valid effect types defined in the TrinityCore spell system
    to avoid incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of effectName values can lead to false positives or negatives
    in aura evaluation, potentially causing unexpected gameplay behavior. Always validate
    effect names against known constants from the TrinityCore codebase.
