  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetOptimalFarmingZone
  signature: const FarmingZoneInfo * FarmingCoordinator::GetOptimalFarmingZone(int
    * player, ProfessionType profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most optimal farming zone for a player based on
    their profession.
  description: The GetOptimalFarmingZone method evaluates the current state of available
    farming zones and determines which one offers the best resource yield or efficiency
    for the specified player's profession. It considers factors such as zone level,
    resource availability, and player proximity to make this determination. This method
    is typically used by the farming coordinator system to guide players toward the
    most beneficial locations for their specific crafting needs. The returned FarmingZoneInfo
    pointer provides detailed information about the recommended zone, including its
    ID, level range, and resource types available. The method requires valid input
    parameters and assumes that the player and profession are properly initialized
    within the system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or index in the system. Must be a valid reference to an existing player.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of profession (e.g., Herbalism,
      Mining) for which the optimal farming zone is being determined. Must correspond
      to a recognized profession type within the game's system.
  returns: A constant pointer to a FarmingZoneInfo structure that contains detailed
    information about the most optimal farming zone for the given player and profession.
    Returns nullptr if no suitable zone can be found or if invalid parameters are
    provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const FarmingZoneInfo* optimalZone = coordinator->GetOptimalFarmingZone(&playerId,\
      \ PROFESSION_HERBALISM);\nif (optimalZone != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Recommended zone ID: \" << optimalZone->zoneId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_MINING;\nconst\
      \ FarmingZoneInfo* zone = coordinator->GetOptimalFarmingZone(&playerId, prof);\n\
      if (zone == nullptr) {\n    // Handle case where no optimal zone is found\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"farming\", \"No optimal farming zone found for player {} with\
      \ profession {}\", playerId, prof);\n} else {\n    // Use the zone data to guide\
      \ player actions\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"farming\", \"Optimal zone for player {} is\
      \ {} (Level {})\", playerId, zone->zoneId, zone->levelRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations involving multiple factors including
    player level, zone difficulty, and resource scarcity. It's recommended to cache
    results when possible to avoid repeated computations during frequent calls. The
    method is thread-safe if the underlying FarmingCoordinator instance is properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer and profession type are valid before calling
    this method; otherwise, it may return an invalid result or cause undefined behavior.
    This function does not modify any internal state of the coordinator but relies
    on external data being consistent.
