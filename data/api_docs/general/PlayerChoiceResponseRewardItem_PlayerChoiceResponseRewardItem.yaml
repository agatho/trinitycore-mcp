  signature: void PlayerChoiceResponseRewardItem::PlayerChoiceResponseRewardItem(uint32
    id, int && bonusListIDs, int32 quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a player choice response reward item with specified ID, bonus
    list IDs, and quantity.
  description: The PlayerChoiceResponseRewardItem constructor initializes a reward
    item associated with a player choice response. It sets up the internal state of
    the reward item using the provided identifier, bonus list identifiers, and quantity.
    This method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's quest
    and choice systems where players can select from multiple reward options. The
    initialization process ensures that the reward item is properly configured for
    subsequent processing or display in the game interface.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the reward item. This corresponds to the
      item's entry in the database and determines what item will be awarded to the
      player.
  - name: bonusListIDs
    description: An rvalue reference to a list of bonus list identifiers that define
      how the item should be modified or enhanced. These IDs are used to apply specific
      bonuses or modifications to the reward item during generation.
  - name: quantity
    description: The number of items to be awarded. This value determines how many
      copies of the specified item will be given to the player as part of the reward.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: PlayerChoiceResponseRewardItem reward(12345, std::move(std::vector<int>{67890}),
      2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Multiple Bonus Lists
    code: 'std::vector<int> bonusList = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      PlayerChoiceResponseRewardItem reward(54321, std::move(bonusList), 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is designed to be used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when processing player choice responses. The bonusListIDs parameter expects an
    rvalue reference to avoid unnecessary copying of data structures. Developers should
    ensure that the item ID exists in the database and that bonus list IDs are valid
    for the given item type.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the quantity parameter may result in unexpected behavior
    or no items being awarded. Ensure that all bonus list IDs provided are valid for
    the specified item to prevent runtime errors or incorrect item generation.
