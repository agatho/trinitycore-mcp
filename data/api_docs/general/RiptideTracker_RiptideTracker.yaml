documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new RiptideTracker instance with default values.
  description: The RiptideTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the RiptideTracker
    class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures required for
    tracking riptide effects in the game. It ensures that all member variables are
    properly initialized to their default states, preparing the object for use in
    managing riptide-related mechanics such as duration tracking, application timing,
    and effect management within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RiptideTracker instance
    code: 'RiptideTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when creating
    new riptide effect instances. Developers should not directly instantiate RiptideTracker
    objects unless implementing custom riptide mechanics or extending existing functionality.
