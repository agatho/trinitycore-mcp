  method: InitializeCooldowns
  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::InitializeCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking for all Havoc Demon Hunter abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the initial state of all ability
    cooldowns for a Havoc Demon Hunter class character. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when switching to the Havoc specialization, ensuring
    that all abilities start with their correct base cooldown values. It configures
    internal cooldown tracking mechanisms and resets any temporary cooldown modifications
    that might have been applied previously. The method ensures that the demon hunter's
    ability usage respects game balance by properly initializing each skill's cooldown
    timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'HavocDemonHunterRefactored* hunter = new HavocDemonHunterRefactored();

      hunter->InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the character's lifecycle or
    when switching to the Havoc specialization. It directly manipulates internal cooldown
    state and should not be invoked repeatedly without proper cleanup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without resetting previous cooldown
    states may lead to inconsistent behavior. Ensure all existing cooldowns are properly
    cleared before calling this method.
