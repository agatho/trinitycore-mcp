  class: WorldObject
  method: GetHitSpherePointFor
  signature: void WorldObject::GetHitSpherePointFor(const Position & dest, float &
    x, float & y, float & z) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the point on the hit sphere of this WorldObject that intersects
    with a line from the object's center to the given destination position.
  description: This method computes the exact point on the hit sphere (bounding volume)
    of the WorldObject where a ray cast from the object's center would intersect with
    the sphere, given a destination point. It is primarily used in combat calculations
    and spell targeting to determine precise hit locations for attacks or effects
    that interact with an object's physical bounds. The method modifies the provided
    x, y, z coordinates to represent this intersection point. This calculation considers
    the object's current position and its defined hit sphere radius, which may vary
    based on the type of WorldObject (player, creature, game object, etc.). The result
    is useful for determining valid target points in combat mechanics, spell effects,
    or movement calculations where precise spatial relationships are required.
  parameters:
  - name: dest
    description: The destination Position to calculate the hit sphere intersection
      point against. This represents the target location from which the ray originates
      at the WorldObject's center.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Hit Sphere Point for Target Position
    code: 'Position targetPos(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      float hitX, hitY, hitZ;

      player->GetHitSpherePointFor(targetPos, hitX, hitY, hitZ);

      // hitX, hitY, hitZ now contain the intersection point on player''s hit sphere'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used internally by TrinityCore's combat system and
    spell processing to determine accurate hit points for attacks or effects. The
    calculation assumes a spherical hit box for the WorldObject and uses vector mathematics
    to compute the intersection point. Performance is generally efficient as it involves
    basic geometric calculations, but repeated calls in tight loops should be avoided
    if not necessary.
