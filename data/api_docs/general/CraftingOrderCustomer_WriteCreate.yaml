  class: CraftingOrderCustomer
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CraftingOrderCustomer::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes crafting order customer data into a byte buffer for network transmission.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the crafting order customer information
    into a ByteBuffer format suitable for sending to clients. This method is typically
    used when creating or updating crafting order customer entries in the game world,
    ensuring that all relevant player data is properly encoded for network communication.
    The serialization includes information about both the owner and receiver of the
    crafting order, which are essential for maintaining proper ownership and relationship
    tracking within the crafting system. The method does not return any value but
    modifies the provided ByteBuffer parameter directly.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized crafting order customer
      data will be written. This buffer is populated with the encoded player information
      for network transmission.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      order. May be null if no owner is specified, though this is typically not expected
      in normal operation.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the receiver of the crafting
      order. May be null if no receiver is specified, though this is typically not
      expected in normal operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for sending crafting order data
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      CraftingOrderCustomer customer;

      customer.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to client via WorldPacket or similar mechanism'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete crafting order creation with serialization
    code: "void SendCraftingOrderUpdate(CraftingOrderCustomer& customer, Player* owner,\
      \ Player* receiver) {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    data << uint8(0); // Packet\
      \ type\n    customer.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);\n    WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CRAFTING_ORDER_UPDATE,\
      \ data.size());\n    packet.append(data);\n    owner->SendDirectMessage(&packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the crafting system's serialization framework and
    should only be called when preparing data for network transmission. The method
    assumes that both owner and receiver parameters are valid Player objects, though
    null checks may be implemented internally. Performance considerations include
    avoiding repeated buffer reallocations during frequent updates.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers unless the system specifically
    allows it. Improper handling of player references can lead to memory corruption
    or incorrect data transmission. Ensure that the ByteBuffer is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
