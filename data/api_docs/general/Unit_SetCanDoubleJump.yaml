  class: Unit
  method: SetCanDoubleJump
  signature: bool Unit::SetCanDoubleJump(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables double jump capability for the unit.
  description: This method sets whether the specified unit can perform a double jump,
    which is a game mechanic that allows players to jump again while in mid-air. The
    method returns true if the setting was successfully applied, false otherwise.
    It affects the unit's ability to perform additional jumps during flight, particularly
    useful for players who are using abilities or talents that allow double jump functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the double jump capability was successfully set, false
    if the operation failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* player = GetPlayer();\nbool success = player->SetCanDoubleJump(true);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Player can now double jump\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with game mechanics that allow
    players to perform additional jumps while airborne. The implementation may depend
    on the specific unit type and its current state, such as whether it's in flight
    or not.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect gameplay balance
    and player experience. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior during
    movement or jumping.
