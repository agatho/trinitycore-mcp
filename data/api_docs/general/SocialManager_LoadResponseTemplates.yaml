documentation:
  brief: Loads response templates for social interactions in the game.
  description: The LoadResponseTemplates method initializes and loads predefined response
    templates used by the SocialManager for handling player social interactions such
    as friend requests, guild invitations, and other communication events. This method
    typically reads data from database tables or configuration files to populate internal
    data structures that store these templates. It is usually invoked during server
    startup or when the social system is initialized. The loaded templates are then
    used to generate appropriate automated responses based on player actions and game
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;

      socialMgr->LoadResponseTemplates();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and should not
    be invoked repeatedly during runtime unless the templates need to be reloaded
    from source. The method may involve database queries or file I/O operations which
    could impact performance if called frequently.
