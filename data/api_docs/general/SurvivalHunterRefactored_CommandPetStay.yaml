documentation:
  brief: Orders the hunter's pet to stop moving and remain in its current position.
  description: The CommandPetStay method instructs the hunter's active pet to cease
    all movement and remain stationary at its current location. This command is typically
    issued when the hunter wants their pet to hold position during combat or while
    performing other actions. The method affects the pet's AI behavior, setting its
    movement state to 'stay' which prevents it from pursuing targets or moving freely
    around the battlefield. This functionality is part of the standard hunter pet
    control mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyHunterAI::HandlePlayerCommand()\n{\n    // When player issues stay\
      \ command\n    m_hunter->CommandPetStay();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the pet's AI state machine and will only
    affect the currently controlled pet. The implementation relies on the pet's current
    movement state and may not work if the pet is in a state that prevents command
    processing.
