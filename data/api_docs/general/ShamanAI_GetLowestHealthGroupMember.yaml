  class: ShamanAI
  method: GetLowestHealthGroupMember
  signature: int * ShamanAI::GetLowestHealthGroupMember() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the lowest health group member for the Shaman AI.
  description: The GetLowestHealthGroupMember method identifies and returns the unique
    identifier (GUID) of the group member with the lowest current health within the
    shaman's group. This functionality is typically used by Shaman AI logic to determine
    which group member requires immediate healing attention. The method operates on
    the assumption that the shaman has a valid group and that the group members are
    within the same zone or instance. It does not perform any health calculations
    itself but rather retrieves pre-calculated health values from the group's current
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the lowest health group
    member, or nullptr if no valid group member is found or if the shaman is not in
    a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find lowest health target
    code: "if (int* guid = shamanAI->GetLowestHealthGroupMember()) {\n    Unit* target\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *guid);\n    if (target && target->IsInWorld())\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with healing logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group's health values are up-to-date and that
    the shaman AI has access to a valid group context. The returned GUID should be
    used carefully as it may become invalid if the target leaves the group or dies.
  warnings: The return value is a pointer to an integer, so developers must ensure
    proper null checking before dereferencing. Also, the method does not update health
    values itself; it relies on external systems to maintain accurate health state
    of group members.
