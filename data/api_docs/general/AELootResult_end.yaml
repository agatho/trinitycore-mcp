  brief: Ends the loot result processing and returns the final outcome code
  description: The AELootResult::end() method signifies the completion of a loot result
    operation within the TrinityCore AI system. This method typically finalizes the
    loot distribution process, cleans up internal resources, and returns an integer
    status code indicating success or failure of the operation. The return value can
    be used by calling code to determine if the loot processing completed successfully
    or encountered an error condition. This method is commonly invoked at the conclusion
    of AI-based loot handling routines in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer status code where 0 typically indicates success and
    non-zero values represent various error conditions or failure states during loot
    result processing. The specific meaning of different return codes depends on the
    internal implementation of the AELootResult class and its associated loot handling
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI loot processing
    code: "AELootResult result;\n// ... perform loot operations ...\nint status =\
      \ result.end();\nif (status == 0) {\n    // Loot processing completed successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Loot processing completed successfully.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error condition\n    sLog->outError(\"Loot processing failed\
      \ with code: %d\", status);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all loot result operations have been
    properly initialized and executed. The method is marked as const, indicating it
    does not modify the state of the AELootResult object but may perform final cleanup
    operations. It's recommended to check the return value for proper error handling
    in production code.
  warnings: Calling this method before completing all necessary loot processing steps
    may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The return value should always
    be checked as it indicates whether the loot operation was properly concluded,
    and ignoring it could lead to inconsistent game state.
