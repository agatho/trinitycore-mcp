  signature: uint32 Unit::GetDamageReduction(uint32 damage) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage reduction value for a given damage amount.
  description: The GetDamageReduction method computes the effective damage reduction
    applied to a specific damage value, taking into account various factors such as
    armor, resistances, and other defensive modifiers. This method is commonly used
    in combat calculations to determine how much damage will be mitigated when a unit
    receives an attack. The returned value represents the actual damage reduction
    that can be applied to incoming damage, typically expressed as a percentage or
    fixed amount depending on the context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the calculated damage reduction value as an integer, representing
    the amount of damage that will be reduced from the input damage. This value may
    be zero if no reduction is applied or could represent a significant portion of
    the original damage based on defensive stats.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 damageReduction = unit->GetDamageReduction(100);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within combat calculations and may involve
    complex interactions with other defensive stats. Performance considerations include
    potential overhead from calculating reduction values, especially in high-frequency
    combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method may return zero if no damage reduction is applied, which could
    happen when the unit has no armor or resistance values. Be cautious of potential
    integer overflow when dealing with large damage values.
