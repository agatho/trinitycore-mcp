  signature: uint32 BotPriorityManager::GetMaxBotsPerPriority(BotPriority priority)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum number of bots allowed for a specified priority level.
  description: The GetMaxBotsPerPriority method returns the configured limit for the
    number of bots that can be assigned to a given priority level within the bot management
    system. This value is typically used to enforce resource constraints and ensure
    balanced bot distribution across different gameplay priorities such as PvP, PvE,
    or quest completion. The method takes a BotPriority enum value as input and returns
    a uint32 representing the maximum count of bots allowed for that specific priority.
    This function does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the maximum number of bots permitted for the
    specified priority level. Returns zero if the priority level is invalid or not
    configured.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve max bots for a specific priority
    code: "uint32 maxBots = botPriorityManager->GetMaxBotsPerPriority(BotPriority::PvP);\n\
      if (maxBots > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Maximum PvP bots allowed: \" << maxBots\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with bot assignment logic to
    prevent exceeding configured limits. It is recommended to cache this value if
    it's accessed frequently, as the underlying configuration may be loaded from a
    database or config file.
