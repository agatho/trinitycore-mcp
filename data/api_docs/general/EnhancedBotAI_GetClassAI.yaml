documentation:
  brief: Returns the class-specific AI instance associated with this enhanced bot.
  description: The GetClassAI method retrieves a pointer to the ClassAI object that
    handles class-specific behavior and decision-making for the enhanced bot. This
    method is typically used within the bot's AI system to access specialized logic
    that governs how the bot behaves based on its class, such as spell selection,
    combat strategies, or resource management. The returned ClassAI instance is owned
    by the EnhancedBotAI object and should not be deleted by the caller. This method
    is essential for implementing class-specific AI behaviors in TrinityCore's enhanced
    bot framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ClassAI object that manages class-specific AI logic for
    this enhanced bot, or nullptr if no class AI has been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access class AI
    code: "ClassAI* classAI = bot->GetClassAI();\nif (classAI != nullptr)\n{\n   \
      \ // Use the class-specific AI logic\n    classAI->UpdateAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for specific class AI type
    code: "EnhancedBotAI* bot = ...;\nClassAI* classAI = bot->GetClassAI();\nif (classAI\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Cast to specific class AI type if needed\n    if (auto\
      \ warriorAI = dynamic_cast<WarriorClassAI*>(classAI))\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ warrior-specific actions\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ClassAI pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the EnhancedBotAI
    object. This method is part of the enhanced bot AI architecture in TrinityCore
    and should only be called on initialized bots. The implementation assumes that
    the class AI has already been properly constructed and assigned to the bot.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured bot may
    return a null pointer, which could lead to crashes if not properly checked. Always
    verify the returned pointer before using it in critical code paths.
