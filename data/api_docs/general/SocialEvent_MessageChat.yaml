    senderName, std::string msg, ChatMsg type, Language lang, std::string channel,
    uint32 achievementId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message to a player or target with specified parameters including
    sender name, message content, chat type, language, and optional channel.
  description: The MessageChat method is used to dispatch a chat message within the
    TrinityCore framework. It allows developers to send various types of in-game messages
    such as system announcements, private messages, guild communications, or general
    chat. The method supports multiple chat types (e.g., say, yell, whisper) and languages,
    making it versatile for different communication scenarios. This function is typically
    used by game systems or scripts that need to communicate with players directly
    through the chat interface. It returns a SocialEvent object which can be used
    for further processing or chaining of social actions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of the player who will receive
      the message. This is typically retrieved using functions like GetPlayerGUID().
  - name: target
    description: The GUID of the target player if applicable, such as in whisper or
      private messages. For broadcast messages, this can be set to 0.
  - name: senderName
    description: The name of the sender that will appear in the chat message. This
      can be a player's name, NPC name, or system-generated identifier.
  - name: msg
    description: The actual text content of the message to be sent to the player.
  - name: type
    description: The type of chat message being sent. This should be one of the ChatMsg
      enumeration values such as CHAT_MSG_SAY, CHAT_MSG_YELL, CHAT_MSG_WHISPER, etc.
  - name: lang
    description: The language code used for the message. Should correspond to a valid
      Language enum value like LANG_UNIVERSAL, LANG_ORCISH, etc.
  - name: channel
    description: The name of the channel if the message is intended for a specific
      chat channel (e.g., 'General', 'Trade'). For direct messages or general chat,
      this can be left empty.
  - name: achievementId
    description: An optional achievement ID that may be associated with the message.
      This could trigger certain achievements or notifications when sent to players.
  returns: Returns a SocialEvent object representing the chat event that was created.
    This object can be used for chaining additional social actions or further processing
    of the event.
  examples:
  - title: Sending a Whisper Message
    code: SocialEvent event = social->MessageChat(playerGuid, targetGuid, "System",
      "Hello there!", CHAT_MSG_WHISPER, LANG_UNIVERSAL, "", 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcasting a System Message
    code: SocialEvent event = social->MessageChat(0, 0, "Server", "Welcome to our
      server!", CHAT_MSG_SAY, LANG_UNIVERSAL, "", 0);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the player and target GUIDs are valid and exist in
    the world. It is recommended to validate these before calling the function. The
    returned SocialEvent object should be handled appropriately depending on whether
    further actions are needed.
  warnings: Incorrect ChatMsg or Language values may cause unexpected behavior or
    message display issues. Always ensure that the senderName is properly sanitized
    to prevent potential exploits or UI glitches.
