  class: Player
  method: DeleteOldCharacters
  signature: void Player::DeleteOldCharacters(uint32 keepDays)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes old character records from the database based on specified time period
  description: The DeleteOldCharacters method removes character records that have
    not been updated for a specified number of days, helping maintain database cleanliness
    and performance. This method is typically used during server maintenance or cleanup
    operations to ensure older characters are removed from the database. The implementation
    involves checking character last update times and deleting those that exceed the
    keepDays threshold. This process helps reduce database size and improves query
    performance for active characters.
  parameters:
  - name: keepDays
    description: Specifies the number of days to keep character records in the database
      before deletion. Characters not updated within this period will be removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->DeleteOldCharacters(30);

      // Deletes characters that haven''t been updated in 30 days or more'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or maintenance operations.
    Implementation may involve database queries to identify and delete old character
    records. Performance considerations include potential database locking during
    deletion operations.
  warnings: This method permanently deletes character data from the database, so it
    should only be used when the server is in maintenance mode. Improper use could
    result in loss of character data or unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
