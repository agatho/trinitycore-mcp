  class: Conversation
  method: AddActor
  signature: void Conversation::AddActor(int actorId, int actorIdx, ConversationActorType
    type, int creatureId, int creatureDisplayInfoId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an actor to a conversation with specified properties including creature
    ID and display info.
  description: The AddActor method registers an actor within a conversation, associating
    it with specific creature data. This allows the conversation system to properly
    display and manage NPC actors during dialogue sequences. The method takes parameters
    that define the actor's role, visual representation, and identification within
    the conversation context. It is typically used when setting up scripted conversations
    or quest-related dialogues where NPCs participate in the narrative flow.
  parameters:
  - name: actorId
    description: Unique identifier for the actor within the conversation context.
      Used to reference this specific actor during conversation events.
  - name: actorIdx
    description: Index position of the actor in the conversation's actor list. Determines
      ordering and positioning of actors during dialogue sequences.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of actor (e.g., NPC, player,
      object). Defines how the actor behaves within the conversation system.
  - name: creatureId
    description: Database identifier for the creature template associated with this
      actor. Links to the CreatureTemplate table in the database.
  - name: creatureDisplayInfoId
    description: Identifier for the creature's display information, determining visual
      appearance including model, size, and animations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Actor Addition
    code: 'Conversation* conv = sObjectMgr->GetConversation(12345);

      conv->AddActor(1, 0, CONVERSATION_ACTOR_NPC, 1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Actors to Conversation
    code: 'Conversation* conv = sObjectMgr->GetConversation(12345);

      conv->AddActor(1, 0, CONVERSATION_ACTOR_NPC, 1234, 5678);

      conv->AddActor(2, 1, CONVERSATION_ACTOR_NPC, 1235, 5679);

      conv->AddActor(3, 2, CONVERSATION_ACTOR_PLAYER, 0, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during conversation initialization or setup
    phase. The actorId and actorIdx must be unique within the conversation context
    to avoid conflicts. The creatureId and creatureDisplayInfoId parameters are essential
    for proper visual representation of actors in-game.
  warnings: Calling this method after a conversation has started may cause undefined
    behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that all actor indices are sequential and
    do not exceed the maximum allowed actors per conversation. Invalid creature IDs
    or display info IDs will result in missing or incorrect visual representations.
