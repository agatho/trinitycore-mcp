  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos, float safetyThreshold)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe for unit movement based on proximity
    to obstacles and terrain.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates whether a specified position is
    considered safe for a unit to move to, taking into account factors such as proximity
    to dangerous terrain features, obstacles, or other environmental hazards. This
    function is typically used by the pathfinding system to ensure that generated
    paths do not lead units into areas that could cause them to become stuck or take
    damage. The safety threshold parameter allows developers to adjust how strictly
    safety checks are enforced, with lower values being more permissive and higher
    values more restrictive.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position to evaluate for safety, represented as an integer identifier
      or index within the pathfinding grid. This parameter typically refers to a specific
      node or coordinate in the navigation mesh.
  - name: safetyThreshold
    description: A float value that determines how strictly safety checks are applied.
      Values closer to 0.0 indicate more permissive safety standards, while values
      closer to 1.0 enforce stricter safety requirements. The exact interpretation
      may vary based on internal implementation details.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is deemed safe according to the
    safety threshold; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that
    the position might lead to an unsafe or blocked state for unit movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IsPositionSafe
    code: "bool isSafe = pathfindingManager->IsPositionSafe(42, 0.7f);\nif (isSafe)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with movement to position 42\n    unit->MoveTo(42);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPositionSafe in path validation
    code: "float safetyThreshold = 0.9f;\nfor (auto& candidateNode : potentialPathNodes)\n\
      {\n    if (!pathfindingManager->IsPositionSafe(candidateNode, safetyThreshold))\n\
      \    {\n        // Skip unsafe nodes\n        continue;\n    }\n    // Add safe\
      \ node to valid path\n    validPath.push_back(candidateNode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core pathfinding infrastructure and should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections. The exact nature of 'safety'
    is determined by internal pathfinding algorithms and may include checks for height
    differences, obstacle proximity, and unit-specific movement constraints.
  warnings: The safetyThreshold parameter can significantly affect pathfinding behavior.
    Using a very high threshold might result in overly conservative pathing that prevents
    units from reaching their destinations efficiently. Ensure that the threshold
    value aligns with expected game mechanics and performance requirements.
