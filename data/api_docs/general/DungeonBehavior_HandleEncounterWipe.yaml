  method: HandleEncounterWipe
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleEncounterWipe(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a dungeon encounter is wiped by the player group.
  description: The HandleEncounterWipe method is invoked when a group fails an encounter
    in a dungeon, typically due to all players being defeated or abandoning the fight.
    This method processes the wipe event, potentially awarding penalties, resetting
    encounter progress, and notifying relevant systems about the failure. It is part
    of the DungeonBehavior class which manages dungeon-specific logic and player interactions
    during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group that triggered
      the wipe event. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific encounter that was wiped. Used
      to determine which boss or event failed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Logic
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnPlayerWipe(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    dungeonBehavior.HandleEncounterWipe(group, encounterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Dungeon System
    code: "class MyDungeonSystem : public DungeonBehavior\n{\npublic:\n    void ProcessWipe(Group*\
      \ group, uint32 encounterId) override\n    {\n        // Custom wipe handling\
      \ logic\n        HandleEncounterWipe(group, encounterId);\n        // Additional\
      \ custom behavior after wipe\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a group fails an encounter. Developers should ensure that any custom logic added
    to this method does not interfere with core dungeon mechanics or player progression.
    The method assumes valid Group and encounterId parameters.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain about the group's
    state and encounter context. Improper usage may lead to incorrect dungeon state
    management or player progression issues. Ensure that the group is properly validated
    before invoking this method.
