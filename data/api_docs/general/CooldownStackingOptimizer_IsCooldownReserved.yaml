  signature: bool CooldownStackingOptimizer::IsCooldownReserved(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified spell's cooldown is currently reserved in the cooldown
    stacking optimizer.
  description: The IsCooldownReserved method determines whether a given spell ID has
    its cooldown reserved within the CooldownStackingOptimizer system. This functionality
    is typically used to prevent certain spells from being cast when their cooldowns
    are already in use or reserved by other game mechanics, such as abilities that
    share cooldowns or those affected by specific buffs/debuffs. The method evaluates
    the internal state of the optimizer to return a boolean result indicating reservation
    status. It does not modify any state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell's cooldown is currently reserved; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (optimizer.IsCooldownReserved(12345)) {\n    // Spell with ID 12345\
      \ is currently reserved\n    // Prevent casting or take alternative action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void Player::CastSpellIfNotReserved(uint32 spellId) {\n    if (!cooldownOptimizer.IsCooldownReserved(spellId))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with casting the spell\n        DoCast(spellId);\n \
      \   } else {\n        // Handle cooldown reservation (e.g., send message to\
      \ player)\n        SendSystemMessage(\"Spell is on cooldown.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CooldownStackingOptimizer has been properly
    initialized and populated with relevant spell cooldown data. The internal logic
    may rely on spell ID mappings and global cooldown tracking, so performance is
    optimized for frequent checks but should be used judiciously in high-frequency
    loops.
  warnings: Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid and registered within
    the optimizer's cooldown database; invalid IDs might lead to unexpected behavior
    or undefined results. Also, note that this method does not account for dynamic
    cooldown changes during runtime unless explicitly updated by other parts of the
    system.
