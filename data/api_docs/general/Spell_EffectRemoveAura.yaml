  brief: Removes aura effects from spell targets
  description: The EffectRemoveAura method removes aura effects from spell targets,
    typically used in conjunction with other spell effect methods to manage debuff
    and buff mechanics. This method is part of the Spell class and operates on the
    target's aura state, removing specific aura effects based on the spell's configuration.
    It's commonly used in scenarios where a spell needs to remove existing effects
    from targets, such as when a spell is cast or when a spell effect is applied.
    The method handles the removal of various aura types including periodic effects,
    temporary buffs, and debuffs that may be active on the target.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectRemoveAura();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution when the spell needs
    to remove existing aura effects from targets. It may be used in conjunction with
    other methods like EffectApplyAura or EffectUpdateAura to manage the lifecycle
    of spell effects. Implementation details include handling of target's aura state
    and ensuring proper removal of effects without causing conflicts with other active
    effects.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly outside of spell execution contexts,
    as it may cause unexpected behavior if used in isolation. Care must be taken to
    ensure that the spell's target is properly initialized before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with multiple aura effects.
