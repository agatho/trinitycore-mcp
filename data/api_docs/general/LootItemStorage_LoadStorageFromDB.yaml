  class: LootItemStorage
  method: LoadStorageFromDB
  signature: void LootItemStorage::LoadStorageFromDB()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all loot item data from the database into memory for the LootItemStorage
    instance.
  description: The LoadStorageFromDB method retrieves all stored loot item entries
    from the game's database and populates the internal storage container within the
    LootItemStorage class. This method is typically invoked during server startup
    or when initializing loot systems to ensure that all configured loot items are
    available for distribution. It performs a database query to fetch relevant loot
    data and processes each record into an in-memory structure for efficient access
    during gameplay. The method does not accept any parameters and does not return
    a value, as it directly modifies the internal state of the class instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'LootItemStorage lootStorage;

      lootStorage.LoadStorageFromDB();

      // Loot items are now loaded and ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called once during server initialization. It may cause
    a temporary performance impact due to database I/O operations, especially if there
    are many loot entries. The method assumes that the database connection is already
    established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without clearing previous data may
    result in duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that the database schema matches
    expected formats to avoid runtime errors during data processing.
