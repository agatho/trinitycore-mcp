documentation:
  brief: Retrieves stored data value associated with the specified identifier from
    the AreaTriggerAI instance.
  description: The GetData method is used to retrieve a previously stored data value
    within an AreaTriggerAI instance. This method allows access to custom data that
    may have been set using a corresponding SetData method or through other internal
    mechanisms during the area trigger's lifecycle. The retrieved value is identified
    by a unique uint32 identifier, which serves as a key for accessing specific data
    fields. This functionality supports dynamic behavior modification and state tracking
    within area triggers, enabling complex interactions based on contextual data.
    The method is typically invoked during event handling or periodic updates to make
    decisions based on stored trigger states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 data value associated with the specified identifier.
    If no data has been set for the given ID, the behavior depends on implementation
    but typically returns zero or a default value indicating absence of data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Area Trigger Data
    code: "uint32 triggerState = areaTriggerAI->GetData(12345);\nif (triggerState\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Perform action based on trigger state\n    // Example: activate\
      \ a spell or change environment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTriggerAI interface and should only be called
    when the AI instance is properly initialized. The data storage mechanism relies
    on internal mapping between uint32 IDs and their corresponding values, which must
    be managed carefully to avoid conflicts or memory leaks.
  warnings: Ensure that the ID parameter corresponds to a valid data field previously
    set using SetData. Accessing an unset or invalid ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect logic flow depending on implementation details.
