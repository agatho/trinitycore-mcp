  signature: void NavMeshInterface::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all navigation mesh statistics to their initial state.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and resets all accumulated performance
    and usage metrics associated with the navigation mesh system. This includes clearing
    counters for pathfinding operations, memory allocations, and other diagnostic
    data that may have been collected during runtime. The method is typically used
    for performance testing, debugging, or when resetting the state of the navigation
    system to a clean baseline. It does not affect the actual navigation mesh data
    or functionality, only the statistical tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset navigation statistics before performance test
    code: 'NavMeshInterface* navMesh = NavMeshInterface::GetNavMeshInterface();

      navMesh->ResetStatistics();

      // Proceed with performance testing

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may temporarily interrupt ongoing statistical tracking. The reset operation
    is atomic and thread-safe, but calling it while other threads are actively using
    the navigation mesh system might lead to inconsistent statistics during the reset
    period.
