documentation:
  brief: Updates the aura application state for client synchronization.
  description: The ClientUpdate method synchronizes the aura application state with
    the client by sending relevant updates to players who are affected by the aura.
    This method is typically called when an aura's properties change, such as duration,
    stack count, or visual effects. It ensures that the client's UI accurately reflects
    the current state of the aura on the unit. The method handles both adding new
    aura applications and updating existing ones in the client's view. This is a core
    part of TrinityCore's aura system implementation for maintaining accurate visual
    feedback to players.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Client Update Call
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    auraApp->ClientUpdate(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Aura Application Before Removal
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    auraApp->ClientUpdate(true); // Mark for removal\n    unit->RemoveAuraApplication(auraApp);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the aura system when state
    changes occur. It's important to understand that calling ClientUpdate with remove=true
    does not immediately destroy the aura application object; it only signals to the
    client that the aura should be removed from display. The actual removal of the
    aura application from memory is handled separately.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper context may cause client desynchronization
    or visual glitches. It should generally only be called by the aura system itself
    or through appropriate aura management functions. Improper use can lead to incorrect
    aura states being displayed to players.
