  signature: void Creature::InitializeMovementCapabilities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes movement capabilities for the creature, setting up required data
    structures and flags for AI-driven navigation.
  description: The InitializeMovementCapabilities method prepares a Creature object
    for AI-based movement by initializing internal data structures related to pathfinding,
    movement types, and navigation flags. This method is typically called during creature
    creation or respawn to ensure that the creature's movement behavior is properly
    configured before it begins interacting with the world. It sets up default movement
    parameters such as speed, acceleration, and allowed movement types (ground, flying,
    swimming), and ensures that the creature's AI can correctly interpret and execute
    movement commands. The initialization process also includes setting up internal
    state variables that track whether the creature has been initialized for movement
    and what type of movement behavior is expected.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->InitializeMovementCapabilities();

      // Creature is now ready for AI movement'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Creature Creation Context
    code: "void OnCreatureCreate(Creature* creature)\n{\n    // Other initialization\
      \ logic\n    creature->InitializeMovementCapabilities();\n    // Movement is\
      \ now ready for AI to use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per creature instance during its lifecycle.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The initialization
    process does not guarantee that the creature will immediately begin moving, but
    rather prepares it for movement commands to be issued by the AI system.
  warnings: Do not call this method on creatures that are already in the world without
    proper synchronization, as it may interfere with existing movement state. This
    method should not be called from within movement callbacks or during active pathfinding
    operations.
