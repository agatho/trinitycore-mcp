  class: AuctionHouseObject

  signature: void AuctionHouseObject::SendAuctionOutbid(const AuctionPosting * auction,
    int newBidder, uint64 newBidAmount, int trans) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends an outbid notification to the previous bidder when a new bid is placed
    on an auction.
  description: The SendAuctionOutbid method is responsible for notifying the former
    highest bidder that their bid has been exceeded by a new, higher bid. This method
    is typically invoked within the auction house system when a new bid is processed
    and surpasses the current winning bid. It ensures that players are promptly informed
    of changes to auction dynamics, maintaining transparency in the bidding process.
    The notification includes details such as the new bidder's identity, the updated
    bid amount, and transaction information.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to the AuctionPosting object representing the auction that
      was outbid. Must not be null.
  - name: newBidder
    description: The player ID (GUID) of the new bidder who placed the higher bid.
  - name: newBidAmount
    description: The new bid amount in copper that exceeds the previous bid.
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier or context for the auction update, used to
      track the operation within the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendAuctionOutbid
    code: "AuctionPosting* auction = sAuctionMgr->GetAuction(12345);\nif (auction)\n\
      {\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->SendAuctionOutbid(auction, 67890, 500000, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet to the former bidder's client to update
    them on the new bid status. It is part of the auction house's internal logic and
    should be called only when a valid outbid occurs.
  warnings: Ensure that the auction pointer passed is valid and not null, otherwise
    calling this method could result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify
    that the new bidder ID and bid amount are accurate to prevent incorrect notifications.
