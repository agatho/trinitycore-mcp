documentation:
  brief: Updates the global cooldown timer for combat specializations based on the
    elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateGlobalCooldown method is responsible for managing the global
    cooldown (GCD) state within the context of combat specializations. It processes
    the time difference passed as a parameter to determine if the GCD has expired
    or needs updating. This method is typically called during game loop iterations
    to ensure that player actions respect the cooldown restrictions imposed by combat
    specializations. The GCD prevents players from spamming abilities too rapidly
    and ensures balanced gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sObjectMgr->GetWorldTick();\n   \
      \ player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateGlobalCooldown(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from within the main game update loop. It
    modifies internal state related to cooldown timers and should be called regularly
    to maintain accurate GCD behavior. The method does not directly interact with
    the player's action queue but rather updates the underlying cooldown tracking
    mechanism.
