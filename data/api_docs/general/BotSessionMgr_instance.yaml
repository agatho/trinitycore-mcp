documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotSessionMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotSessionMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global bot session management
    functionality from anywhere within the TrinityCore codebase. The returned pointer
    should be treated as a constant reference to the singleton instance and should
    not be deleted or managed manually. This design allows for centralized control
    of bot sessions, including their creation, tracking, and cleanup across the game
    server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotSessionMgr instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton instance; it never returns NULL under
    normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotSessionMgr singleton
    code: 'BotSessionMgr* sessionMgr = BotSessionMgr::instance();

      // Use sessionMgr to manage bot sessions

      sessionMgr->Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using the Meyers singleton
    pattern, which is guaranteed to be thread-safe in C++11 and later. The singleton
    instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
