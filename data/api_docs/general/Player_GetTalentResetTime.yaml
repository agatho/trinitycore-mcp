documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp when player's talent reset time expires
  description: This method retrieves the time_t value representing when the player's
    talent reset time will expire. It is used to determine the next available time
    for resetting talents, which typically occurs after a specified period or upon
    reaching certain level requirements. The returned value represents a Unix timestamp
    that can be compared against current time to determine if talents can be reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when talent reset
    will expire, or 0 if no reset time is set
  examples:
  - title: Check if talent reset is available
    code: "time_t resetTime = player->GetTalentResetTime();\nif (resetTime == 0 ||\
      \ resetTime <= time(NULL)) {\n    // Talent reset is available\n    // Do something\
      \ here\n}\nelse {\n    // Talent reset is not yet available\n    // Wait until\
      \ resetTime\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other talent-related functions
    to determine when a player can reset their talents. The value returned by this
    method may be influenced by game mechanics such as level requirements, quest completion,
    or specific game events.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining if a player can
    reset talents without checking against current time, as the return value represents
    future reset time rather than past reset time. Also note that this method may
    return 0 if no reset time has been set yet.
