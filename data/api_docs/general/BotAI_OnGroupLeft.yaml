  class: BotAI
  method: OnGroupLeft
  signature: void BotAI::OnGroupLeft()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot leaves a group in the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The OnGroupLeft method is invoked when a bot character exits a group,
    either voluntarily or due to being removed by another player. This method performs
    cleanup operations such as resetting group-related AI states, releasing any shared
    resources with group members, and updating internal tracking structures to reflect
    the change in group membership. It ensures that the bot's AI behavior adapts correctly
    to the new state where it is no longer part of a group, which may affect its decision-making
    processes, movement patterns, and interaction with other players or NPCs.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Logic
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnGroupLeft()\n{\n    // Reset group-specific flags\n   \
      \ m_isInGroup = false;\n    m_groupLeaderGuid.Clear();\n    \n    // Perform\
      \ cleanup tasks\n    CleanupGroupResources();\n    \n    // Log the event\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u has left the group.\", GetBot()->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from within the bot's AI update loop or triggered
    by an appropriate event handler when a group membership change occurs. It is expected
    to be thread-safe as it typically operates on local state rather than shared resources.
  warnings: Ensure that all group-specific data structures are properly reset before
    returning, otherwise the bot may continue to behave incorrectly even after leaving
    the group.
