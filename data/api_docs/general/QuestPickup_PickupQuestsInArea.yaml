  class: QuestPickup
  method: PickupQuestsInArea
  signature: void QuestPickup::PickupQuestsInArea(Player * bot, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates quest pickup for all available quests within a specified radius
    around the player.
  description: The PickupQuestsInArea method scans the area surrounding the provided
    player character and attempts to pick up any quests that are available for pickup.
    This function is typically used in botting or automation contexts where a player
    character needs to automatically collect nearby quest items or accept quests without
    manual interaction. The method iterates through all game objects within the specified
    radius, checking if they are quest givers or quest items eligible for pickup.
    It does not return any value but modifies the player's quest state by adding eligible
    quests to their active quest log.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character that will
      perform the quest pickup operation. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: radius
    description: Floating-point value specifying the search radius in yards around
      the player's current position. Defines how far the method will scan for quest-related
      objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      QuestPickup::PickupQuestsInArea(myBot, 10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Pickup with Radius Adjustment
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      float searchRadius = 25.0f;

      QuestPickup::PickupQuestsInArea(bot, searchRadius);

      // This will pick up quests within a 25-yard radius of the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in automated scripts or AI systems.
    It performs operations that may be flagged by anti-cheat systems if used inappropriately.
    The function relies on the underlying World of Warcraft quest system and will
    only pickup quests that are valid for the player's level and faction. Performance
    can be affected when using large radius values due to increased object scanning.
  warnings: Using this method in a live game environment may violate the game's terms
    of service and could result in account penalties. The function assumes all parameters
    are valid and does not perform null checks on the Player pointer. Improper use
    in automated bots can lead to detection by server-side anti-cheat mechanisms.
