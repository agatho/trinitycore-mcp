  class: MageAI
  method: RecordSpellCast
  signature: void MageAI::RecordSpellCast(uint32 spellId, ::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Records a spell cast event by the mage AI, including the spell ID and target
    unit.
  description: The RecordSpellCast method is used within the MageAI class to log or
    track when a mage casts a specific spell on a target. This functionality is typically
    employed for AI behavior management, cooldown tracking, or spell history analysis.
    The method accepts the unique identifier of the spell being cast and a pointer
    to the target unit. It does not return any value but updates internal state or
    logs relevant information for the AI's decision-making process. This method may
    be called during spell execution to maintain accurate records for strategic purposes
    such as preventing duplicate casts or managing spell priorities.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This value corresponds
      to the SpellEntry ID in the game's database and determines which spell is executed.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that serves as the target of the spell.
      Can be nullptr if no target is specified, though this may not be valid for all
      spells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Recording
    code: "void SomeMageAI::OnSpellCast(uint32 spellId, Unit* target)\n{\n    RecordSpellCast(spellId,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a Fireball Cast on Target
    code: "if (Unit* target = SelectBestTarget())\n{\n    RecordSpellCast(133, target);\
      \ // Fireball spell ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that tracks spell usage
    for optimizing behavior. It may interact with cooldown systems or spell prioritization
    logic. The internal implementation might involve storing spell cast times, target
    information, or updating AI state variables.
  warnings: Ensure the spellId is valid and corresponds to an actual spell in the
    database; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Also, be cautious about calling
    this method with a null target pointer unless the AI logic explicitly supports
    it.
