  signature: void MovementInfo::AddMovementFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a movement flag to the MovementInfo object, enabling specific movement
    behaviors for game entities.
  description: The AddMovementFlag method is used to set or enable a specific movement
    flag within the MovementInfo class. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server implementation to control how a player or creature moves, such
    as walking, running, flying, swimming, or other movement states. The method modifies
    internal state flags that are serialized and sent to clients for accurate movement
    representation. It is typically invoked during movement updates or when changing
    the entity's movement state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Flying Movement Flag
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Multiple Movement Flags
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING);

      movementInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      movementInfo.AddMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal flags that are used in network serialization.
    It's important to ensure that movement flags are properly synchronized with the
    actual movement state of the entity to avoid client-side desynchronization or
    incorrect visual behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of movement flags can cause clients to display erroneous
    movement animations or states. Always verify that flags align with the physical
    movement capabilities of the entity being controlled.
