  method: GetConfig
  signature: const SchedulerConfig & BotScheduler::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration settings for the bot scheduler instance.
  description: The GetConfig method provides access to the immutable configuration
    parameters that define how the BotScheduler operates. This includes settings such
    as scheduling intervals, priority levels, and operational constraints. The returned
    reference points to an internal configuration object that should not be modified
    directly, as changes may lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent scheduling
    logic. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where the
    scheduler instance is accessible.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the SchedulerConfig object containing all current
    configuration settings for this bot scheduler instance. This reference remains
    valid for the lifetime of the BotScheduler object.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Scheduler Configuration
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      const SchedulerConfig& config = scheduler.GetConfig();

      uint32 interval = config.GetUpdateInterval(); // Example usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading Configuration Values for Debugging
    code: "void DebugSchedulerConfig(BotScheduler* scheduler) {\n    const SchedulerConfig&\
      \ config = scheduler->GetConfig();\n    LOG_INFO(\"scheduler\", \"Update interval:\
      \ {} ms\", config.GetUpdateInterval());\n    LOG_INFO(\"scheduler\", \"Max bots:\
      \ {}\", config.GetMaxBots());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SchedulerConfig reference is guaranteed to be valid only while
    the BotScheduler instance exists. The configuration object should be treated as
    read-only, and modifications should be made through dedicated setter methods if
    available. This method does not perform any locking internally, but assumes that
    the underlying configuration data is properly synchronized if accessed concurrently.
