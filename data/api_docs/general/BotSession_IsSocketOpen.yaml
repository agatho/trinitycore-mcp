  method: IsSocketOpen
  signature: bool BotSession::IsSocketOpen() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session's socket connection is currently open and
    active.
  description: The IsSocketOpen method determines if the underlying network socket
    connection for a BotSession is established and ready for communication. This method
    is typically used to verify the connectivity status before attempting to send
    or receive data through the bot session. The socket may be considered open when
    it has successfully connected to the server and is not in a closed or error state.
    This check is essential for maintaining stable bot operations and preventing failed
    communications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the socket connection is open and active, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the connection has been closed,
    is in the process of closing, or encountered an error that resulted in disconnection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Socket Status Check
    code: "if (botSession.IsSocketOpen()) {\n    // Proceed with sending commands\
      \ or data\n    botSession.SendCommand(\"move forward\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ disconnected state\n    LogError(\"Bot session socket is closed\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight check on the socket's current state without
    attempting to communicate over the network. It is recommended to use this method
    before performing any operations that require an active connection to avoid exceptions
    or failed operations.
