  class: InterruptManager
  method: AssessBuffPriority
  signature: InterruptPriority InterruptManager::AssessBuffPriority(const SpellInfo
    * spellInfo, Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level of a spell buff for potential interruption.
  description: The AssessBuffPriority method determines the interrupt priority of
    a given spell buff based on its properties and the caster's state. It is used
    by the InterruptManager to decide whether a specific buff should be interrupted
    or allowed to continue. The method considers factors such as spell duration, damage
    type, and caster status to assign a priority level that influences the decision-making
    process in combat scenarios. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game
    balance and ensuring proper spell interaction mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that cast the spell. Must not be null
      and should represent a valid game entity.
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority enum value indicating the priority level of
    the buff. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL, depending on
    the spell's characteristics and caster state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in interrupt logic
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager.AssessBuffPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nif (priority >= InterruptPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Consider interrupting\
      \ this buff\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using priority to determine interruption strategy
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager.AssessBuffPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nswitch (priority) {\n    case InterruptPriority::LOW:\n        //\
      \ Allow buff to continue\n        break;\n    case InterruptPriority::HIGH:\n\
      \        // Attempt interruption with medium chance\n        break;\n    case\
      \ InterruptPriority::CRITICAL:\n        // Force immediate interruption\n  \
      \      break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat evaluation cycles and may be
    invoked multiple times per tick. The priority assessment considers both spell-specific
    attributes and caster state, including buffs/debuffs that might affect the spell's
    effectiveness or threat generation.
  warnings: Ensure that both spellInfo and caster parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes proper initialization
    of SpellInfo structures and valid Unit objects with complete state information.
