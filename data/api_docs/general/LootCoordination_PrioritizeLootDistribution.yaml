api:
  class: LootCoordination
  method: PrioritizeLootDistribution
  signature: void LootCoordination::PrioritizeLootDistribution(Group * group, int
    & items)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes loot distribution within a group based on specified criteria.
  description: The PrioritizeLootDistribution method adjusts the order and priority
    of loot items for distribution among group members. This method ensures that items
    are distributed fairly according to predefined rules, such as need-before-greed
    mechanics or player participation in the loot roll. It modifies internal state
    variables related to item distribution priorities within the LootCoordination
    system. The method operates on a provided Group object and updates an integer
    reference representing the number of items processed. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining balanced and fair loot allocation in World of Warcraft's group-based
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing members who will receive loot.
      Must be a valid group with at least one member, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer that tracks the number of items processed
      during loot prioritization. This value is updated by the method to reflect how
      many items were considered for priority distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      int processedItems = 0;

      LootCoordination::PrioritizeLootDistribution(group, processedItems);

      // ''processedItems'' now contains the number of items prioritized for distribution'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (!group)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Player not in a group\");\n    return;\n}\n\nint processedItems = 0;\nLootCoordination::PrioritizeLootDistribution(group,\
      \ processedItems);\nsLog->outString(\"Prioritized %d items for distribution\"\
      , processedItems);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state related to loot coordination and should
    only be called when the group is actively engaged in loot distribution. The integer
    reference 'items' may not accurately reflect all items if the group has no active
    loot or if certain conditions prevent prioritization.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid Group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the group contains at least one member before invoking this
    function. Do not call this method during ongoing loot rolls as it may interfere
    with existing distribution logic.
