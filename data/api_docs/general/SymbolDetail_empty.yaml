  signature: bool SymbolDetail::empty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the SymbolDetail object contains any symbols or data.
  description: The empty() method determines if the SymbolDetail instance is devoid
    of any symbols or associated data. This utility function is commonly used to validate
    the state of symbol collections before performing operations that require non-empty
    containers. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting and game logic systems,
    this method helps prevent errors when iterating over or processing symbol tables.
    The method performs a simple internal check on the underlying data structure and
    returns true if no symbols are present, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SymbolDetail object contains no symbols or data; returns
    false if it contains one or more symbols.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check SymbolDetail State
    code: "SymbolDetail symbolDetail;\nif (symbolDetail.empty()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ empty symbol detail case\n    printf(\"No symbols present in the detail object.\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Process symbols\n    printf(\"SymbolDetail contains\
      \ symbols.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using empty() Before Symbol Processing
    code: "SymbolDetail symbolDetail = GetPlayerSymbols(playerGuid);\nif (!symbolDetail.empty())\
      \ {\n    for (const auto& symbol : symbolDetail.GetSymbols()) {\n        ProcessSymbol(symbol);\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Log or handle the case where no symbols were found\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Player {} has no symbols to process.\", playerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The empty() method is typically a constant-time operation since it only checks
    the size or presence of elements in an internal container. It's safe to call from
    any thread context, assuming the SymbolDetail object itself is properly synchronized
    if accessed concurrently.
