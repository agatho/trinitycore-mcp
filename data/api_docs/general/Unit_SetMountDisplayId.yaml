  class: Unit
  method: SetMountDisplayId
  signature: void Unit::SetMountDisplayId(uint32 mountDisplayId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the display ID for a mount on the unit, allowing the unit to show the
    specified mount visually.
  description: This method sets the display ID for a mount on the Unit, which determines
    how the unit appears when mounted. The mount display ID is used to control visual
    representation of the mount in the game world, including the appearance of the
    mount itself and its associated animation effects. This method is commonly used
    for setting mount visuals for players or NPCs and affects the unit's visual state
    within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: mountDisplayId
    description: The display ID of the mount to be set, which corresponds to a specific
      visual representation in the game. This value must be valid and represent an
      actual mount entry in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Display Setting
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetVehicleBase();

      unit->SetMountDisplayId(12345);

      // Sets the mount display ID to 12345 for the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the visual appearance
    of the unit. The mount display ID must correspond to an actual mount entry in
    the game database; otherwise, the unit may appear with invalid or no visual representation.
  warnings: Setting a mount display ID that does not exist in the game database can
    result in visual artifacts or incorrect behavior. Care should be taken when setting
    mount IDs for NPCs or players as it may affect their visual state and gameplay
    mechanics.
