  class: LootDistribution
  method: SetGroupLootThreshold
  signature: void LootDistribution::SetGroupLootThreshold(Group * group, int threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot threshold for a specified group in the loot distribution system.
  description: The SetGroupLootThreshold method configures the minimum loot quality
    level required for items to be distributed to players within a specific group.
    This threshold determines which items are eligible for group loot, with lower
    values allowing more items to be distributed and higher values restricting distribution
    to only high-quality items. The method operates on the group's loot settings and
    affects how loot is processed during group loot distribution events. This functionality
    is crucial for managing loot fairness and quality within raid and dungeon groups.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the loot threshold is being
      set. Must be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: threshold
    description: Integer value representing the minimum loot quality threshold. Valid
      values typically range from 0 (lowest quality) to 4 (highest quality), though
      exact ranges may depend on game version and configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Group Loot Threshold
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    LootDistribution::SetGroupLootThreshold(myGroup,\
      \ 3);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Based on Group Type
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    if (group->isRaidGroup())\n\
      \        LootDistribution::SetGroupLootThreshold(group, 4);\n    else\n    \
      \    LootDistribution::SetGroupLootThreshold(group, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the group's internal loot distribution settings.
    Changes take effect immediately for subsequent loot distributions. The threshold
    value should align with the game's predefined loot quality levels to ensure proper
    functionality. This method is typically called during group creation, raid setup,
    or when adjusting group loot policies dynamically.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the group parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group pointer is valid and the threshold
    value is within acceptable bounds before calling this method. Improper use may
    result in incorrect loot distribution or game instability.
