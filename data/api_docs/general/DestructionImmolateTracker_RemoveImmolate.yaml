documentation:
  brief: Removes an immolate effect from a target specified by its GUID.
  description: The RemoveImmolate method is responsible for eliminating an immolate
    debuff from a specific game object or unit identified by its unique identifier
    (GUID). This method is typically used in the context of destruction class abilities
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It ensures that the immolate
    effect is properly cleared from the target, removing any ongoing damage or visual
    effects associated with it. The method likely interacts with internal tracking
    systems to maintain consistency in the game state and prevent duplicate or conflicting
    effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit or object from which
      the immolate effect should be removed. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing
      the entity's identifier in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Immolate from a Target
    code: 'DestructionImmolateTracker tracker;

      Unit* target = ...; // some unit with immolate effect

      tracker.RemoveImmolate(target->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal tracking systems to ensure that
    the immolate effect is properly removed from the target's state. It may also trigger
    cleanup of associated visual effects or damage ticks.
