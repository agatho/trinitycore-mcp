  brief: Initializes a new instance of the RestorationSwiftmendTracker class.
  description: The RestorationSwiftmendTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the RestorationSwiftmendTracker class. This class is likely used to track the
    state and behavior of Swiftmend, a healing spell in World of Warcraft's restoration
    shaman specialization. The constructor sets up internal data structures and state
    variables required for tracking the spell's effects, cooldowns, or other relevant
    properties within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that the tracker object
    is properly initialized before being used in gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Creating a new Swiftmend Tracker Instance
    code: 'RestorationSwiftmendTracker* tracker = new RestorationSwiftmendTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use in spell tracking logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal member variables such as spell
    cooldown timers, target tracking data, or effect duration counters. It may also
    register the tracker with the game's event system or spell handling framework
    to receive updates about spell casts and effects.
