  brief: Loads and initializes Wrath of the Lich King dungeon data into the dungeon
    behavior system
  description: The LoadWrathDungeons method is responsible for loading all dungeon
    configurations and data specific to the Wrath of the Lich King expansion into
    the DungeonBehavior class. This method typically reads from database tables or
    configuration files containing dungeon templates, spawn information, quest requirements,
    and other expansion-specific parameters. It prepares the dungeon behavior system
    to handle content related to the Lich King expansion including raid instances,
    heroic dungeons, and other content introduced in the 3.0.0 version of World of
    Warcraft. The method is usually called during server initialization or when expansion
    data needs to be dynamically loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadWrathDungeons();

      // Dungeon data is now available for use in the behavior system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to fetch dungeon templates and
    configurations. It may be called multiple times during server runtime if expansion
    content needs to be reloaded or updated. The method should only be called after
    the database connection is established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database initialization can result
    in failed dungeon loading or runtime errors. Ensure that all required database
    tables for Wrath of the Lich King content exist before invoking this method.
