documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information identifier for the bag instance
  description: The GetDebugInfo method retrieves a unique debug identifier associated
    with the Bag object. This identifier is typically used for debugging purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework to distinguish between different bag instances
    during development and troubleshooting. The method does not modify any internal
    state of the bag and provides a constant value that can be used for logging, tracking,
    or identifying specific bag objects in debug output.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the debug information identifier for this
    bag instance. This value is typically a unique identifier assigned during object
    creation or a hash-based representation used for debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Bag* myBag = player->GetBag(0);

      int debugInfo = myBag->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("misc", "Bag debug info: %d", debugInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development purposes.
    The returned value may vary between different TrinityCore versions or builds.
    It's recommended to use this method only in debug builds or when actively troubleshooting
    bag-related issues.
