documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Warlock AI for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateWarlockAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    an AI behavior specifically designed for Warlock class bots within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up the necessary AI components, including spell selection
    logic, target prioritization, and combat strategies tailored to the Warlock's
    unique abilities such as summoning pets, managing curses, and utilizing dark magic
    spells. The method ensures that the bot player is properly equipped with appropriate
    AI decision-making capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the game's
    existing AI system architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player reference,
    insufficient memory allocation, or unsupported class type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warlock AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = factory->CreateWarlockAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the bot\n    printf(\"Warlock AI created successfully\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to create Warlock AI,\
      \ error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is already initialized
    and valid. The AI implementation may require additional setup steps such as loading
    specific spell databases or configuring bot behavior parameters. The method should
    only be called for Player objects that are actually bots, not real players.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the player object is properly
    initialized and represents a valid bot before invoking this method. Additionally,
    repeated calls to this method on the same bot may cause memory leaks or inconsistent
    AI states if not handled carefully.
