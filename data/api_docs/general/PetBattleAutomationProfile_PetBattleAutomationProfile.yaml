documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PetBattleAutomationProfile instance with default settings.
  description: The PetBattleAutomationProfile constructor initializes a new automation
    profile for pet battles in World of Warcraft. This class is used to define rules
    and behaviors for automated pet battle actions, such as which moves to use, when
    to switch pets, and how to handle various battle scenarios. The constructor sets
    up default values for all profile parameters, ensuring that the automation system
    has a valid configuration to work with. This initialization typically occurs when
    creating a new automation profile for a player's pet battles or when resetting
    an existing profile to its default state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PetBattleAutomationProfile
    code: 'PetBattleAutomationProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default settings

      // ready to be configured for pet battle automation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the internal state of the profile object with default
    values. Developers should ensure that any necessary configuration is performed
    after construction before using the profile in automation scenarios.
