  class: LfgReward
  method: LfgReward
  signature: void LfgReward::LfgReward(uint32 _maxLevel, uint32 _firstQuest, uint32
    _otherQuest)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgReward object with specified maximum level and quest
    IDs for first and other rewards.
  description: The LfgReward constructor initializes a new instance of the LfgReward
    class with the provided maximum level and quest identifiers for both first and
    subsequent rewards. This class is used within TrinityCore's Looking for Group
    (LFG) system to define reward structures for dungeon and group content. The maximum
    level parameter determines the highest level at which players can receive these
    rewards, while the firstQuest and otherQuest parameters specify the quest IDs
    that provide rewards for the initial and subsequent entries into a given LFG activity.
    This constructor is typically called internally by the LFG system when loading
    reward configurations from database or configuration files.
  parameters:
  - name: _maxLevel
    description: The maximum player level at which this reward structure applies.
      Players above this level will not receive these rewards.
  - name: _firstQuest
    description: The quest ID that provides rewards for the first entry into an LFG
      activity with this reward structure.
  - name: _otherQuest
    description: The quest ID that provides rewards for subsequent entries (after
      the first) into an LFG activity with this reward structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize LfgReward for level 80 content
    code: 'LfgReward reward(80, 12345, 12346);

      // Creates a reward structure for level 80 players

      // First entry uses quest 12345

      // Subsequent entries use quest 12346'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize LfgReward with different quest IDs
    code: 'LfgReward reward(70, 98765, 98766);

      // Creates a reward structure for level 70 players

      // First entry uses quest 98765

      // Subsequent entries use quest 98766'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore LFG system
    and should not be called directly by external code. The class likely stores these
    values in private member variables for later retrieval during reward processing.
    The quest IDs provided must exist in the database or the LFG system may fail to
    properly award rewards.
  warnings: Incorrect quest IDs can result in players not receiving expected rewards.
    Ensure that the quest IDs passed to this constructor are valid and exist in your
    database. This class is part of TrinityCore's internal LFG implementation and
    may change between versions without notice.
