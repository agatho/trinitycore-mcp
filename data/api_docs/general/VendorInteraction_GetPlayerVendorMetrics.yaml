  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetPlayerVendorMetrics
  signature: VendorMetrics VendorInteraction::GetPlayerVendorMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves vendor interaction metrics for a specified player.
  description: The GetPlayerVendorMetrics method fetches detailed vendor interaction
    statistics for a given player identified by their GUID. These metrics typically
    include data such as the number of items purchased, total gold spent, and transaction
    history with vendors. This function is commonly used in game analytics, player
    behavior tracking, or for implementing custom vendor-related features within TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft servers. The method assumes that the player exists and has engaged
    in vendor interactions; otherwise, it may return default or empty metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A VendorMetrics object containing aggregated data about the player's vendor
    interactions, including purchase counts, gold spent, and other relevant statistics.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized VendorMetrics structure if no data is
    found for the specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      VendorMetrics metrics = vendorInteraction.GetPlayerVendorMetrics(playerGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO("vendor", "Player %u has spent %u gold with vendors.", playerGuid,
      metrics.totalGoldSpent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups or accesses cached player data
    structures. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths to
    avoid unnecessary overhead. The returned VendorMetrics object may not reflect
    real-time changes if caching is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an actual logged-in
    or existing player, as invalid GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    metrics. Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops without proper caching
    or batching strategies.
