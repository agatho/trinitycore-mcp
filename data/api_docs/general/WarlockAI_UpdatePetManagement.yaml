documentation:
  brief: Manages the pet's behavior and actions based on the warlock's current state
    and target.
  description: The UpdatePetManagement method is responsible for controlling how a
    warlock's summoned pet behaves during combat. It evaluates the warlock's current
    target, health status, and spell cooldowns to determine appropriate pet actions
    such as attacking, following, or casting spells. This method ensures that the
    pet acts in accordance with the warlock's tactical needs and maintains optimal
    positioning and threat generation. The method is typically called during the AI
    update cycle and integrates with the overall combat logic of the WarlockAI class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdatePetManagement();\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the pet's current state and the warlock's target information.
    It should only be called when the warlock has an active pet and is in combat mode.
    The method does not directly handle pet summoning or dismissal, but rather manages
    the behavior of an existing summoned pet.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid pet or in non-combat situations may
    lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the pet exists and is properly
    initialized before invoking this method.
