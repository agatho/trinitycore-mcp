  class: Guild
  method: GetAchievementMgr
  signature: const GuildAchievementMgr & Guild::GetAchievementMgr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the guild's achievement manager instance.
  description: The GetAchievementMgr method provides access to the GuildAchievementMgr
    object associated with this guild. This manager handles all achievement-related
    data and logic for the guild, including tracking completed achievements, managing
    achievement criteria progress, and handling achievement rewards. The returned
    reference is constant, meaning the caller cannot modify the achievement manager
    through this interface. This method is typically used by systems that need to
    query or display guild achievements without altering them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the GuildAchievementMgr object associated with
    this guild. This reference remains valid for the lifetime of the guild and provides
    access to all achievement-related functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Guild Achievement Manager
    code: 'Guild* myGuild = ...; // Assume a valid guild pointer

      const GuildAchievementMgr& achievementMgr = myGuild->GetAchievementMgr();

      // Use achievementMgr to query achievements or check progress

      uint32 completedCount = achievementMgr.GetCompletedAchievementsCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GuildAchievementMgr reference is tied to the guild's lifetime
    and should not be stored beyond the scope of the guild object. This method does
    not perform any locking or thread synchronization, so access from multiple threads
    requires external synchronization if needed.
