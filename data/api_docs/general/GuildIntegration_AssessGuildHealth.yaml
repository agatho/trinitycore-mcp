  signature: void GuildIntegration::AssessGuildHealth(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and updates the health status of a specified guild within the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  description: The AssessGuildHealth method performs a comprehensive evaluation of
    a guild's current health state based on various factors such as member activity,
    guild level, and participation in world events. This function is typically invoked
    during periodic maintenance routines or when specific triggers occur within the
    game logic. It updates internal guild statistics and may influence guild-related
    gameplay mechanics like rewards, permissions, or visibility in guild finder systems.
    The method requires a valid guild identifier to operate correctly and does not
    return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild to be assessed. Must correspond to
      an existing guild within the database; otherwise, the operation will have no
      effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AssessGuildHealth(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guild Event Handling
    code: "void OnGuildEvent(Guild* guild)\n{\n    if (guild)\n        GuildIntegration::AssessGuildHealth(guild->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should not cause significant
    performance degradation during normal operation. It internally accesses database
    tables related to guild membership and activity logs.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided guild ID corresponds to an actual guild in the
    database; otherwise, the function will silently fail without producing any error
    messages.
