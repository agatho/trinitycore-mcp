  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleLoadScreenOpcode
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleLoadScreenOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::LoadingScreenNotify
    & loadingScreenNotify)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the loading screen notification opcode sent by the client during
    map transitions.
  description: The HandleLoadScreenOpcode method processes incoming loading screen
    notifications from players' clients. This method is invoked when a player begins
    transitioning between maps or zones, and it typically updates the server-side
    state to reflect that the player is in a loading phase. The method ensures synchronization
    between client and server regarding map loading states, which is crucial for maintaining
    game consistency during transitions. It may also trigger related events such as
    updating player visibility or notifying other players of the transition.
  parameters:
  - name: loadingScreenNotify
    description: The packet containing information about the loading screen state
      sent by the client. This includes details like whether the loading screen is
      being shown, hidden, or updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleLoadScreenOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::LoadingScreenNotify&\
      \ loadingScreenNotify)\n{\n    // Process the loading screen state\n    if (loadingScreenNotify.Show)\n\
      \        SendPacket(loadingScreenNotify.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core session handling system and should be called
    only from within the WorldSession context. It's important to ensure that all related
    client state changes are properly synchronized with server-side data to avoid
    inconsistencies during map transitions.
