  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void FingersOfFrostTracker::ConsumeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a proc from the Fingers of Frost tracker, reducing its active procs.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for decrementing the internal
    counter that tracks active Fingers of Frost procs. This method is typically invoked
    when a proc effect is triggered or consumed, ensuring proper tracking of the spell's
    remaining charges or active effects. It may also handle cleanup operations such
    as removing temporary buffs or resetting timers associated with the proc state.
    The method does not accept any parameters and performs no direct game state changes
    beyond managing the proc counter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FingersOfFrostTracker tracker;

      tracker.ConsumeProc();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FingersOfFrostTracker object has been properly
    initialized and that there is at least one active proc to consume. It should only
    be called when a proc effect is actually consumed or resolved.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the existence of an active proc
    may lead to incorrect state management or unexpected behavior in the spell's cooldown
    or usage tracking.
