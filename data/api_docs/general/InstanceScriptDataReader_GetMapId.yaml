  method: GetMapId
  signature: int InstanceScriptDataReader::GetMapId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique map identifier associated with the current instance
    script context.
  description: The GetMapId method returns the integer identifier of the map where
    the current instance script is executing. This value corresponds to the MapID
    defined in the game's database and is essential for identifying which specific
    dungeon, raid, or world area the script is managing. The returned value typically
    matches the entry found in the `map` table of the TrinityCore database. This method
    is commonly used within instance scripts to perform map-specific logic, such as
    spawning creatures, managing objectives, or handling zone-based events. It is
    important to note that this method should only be called from within an active
    instance script context; otherwise, it may return an invalid or unexpected value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique map identifier (MapID) of the current
    instance. This corresponds to the ID field in the `map` table of the TrinityCore
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an instance script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        int mapId = GetMapId();\n        if (mapId\
      \ == 129)\n        {\n            // Handle specific dungeon logic for Zul'Gurub\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is const and safe to call from any context within an instance
    script. It relies on internal state tracking of the current map, which is automatically
    managed by the TrinityCore framework during instance creation and destruction.
