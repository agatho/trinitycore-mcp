  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: CanWalkBetween
  signature: bool PathfindingUtils::CanWalkBetween(const int & a, const int & b, Map
    * map)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a character can walk between two points in a given map.
  description: The CanWalkBetween method evaluates if there is a valid walking path
    between two specified points within a given map. It performs pathfinding calculations
    to check for obstacles, terrain, and other navigational constraints that would
    prevent a unit from moving directly from point A to point B. This function is
    commonly used in AI behavior, movement validation, and navigation logic for NPCs
    and players. The method requires valid map data and assumes the points are within
    the same map instance. It returns true if a walkable path exists, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: The starting point identifier or index for the first location in
      the map
  - name: b
    description: The ending point identifier or index for the second location in the
      map
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where both points are located; must be
      a valid, initialized map instance
  returns: Returns true if a walkable path exists between points 'a' and 'b' on the
    specified map, false otherwise. The method will also return false if either point
    is invalid or if the map pointer is null.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check walkability between two locations
    code: "Map* myMap = ...; // Assume valid map\nint startLoc = 100;\nint endLoc\
      \ = 200;\nbool isWalkable = PathfindingUtils::CanWalkBetween(startLoc, endLoc,\
      \ myMap);\nif (isWalkable)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CanWalkBetween in NPC AI decision making
    code: "class MyNPC : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (CanWalkBetween(m_targetX, m_targetY, GetMap()))\n\
      \        {\n            // Move towards target\n            DoMoveTo(m_targetX,\
      \ m_targetY);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Find alternative\
      \ path or wait\n            DoWait();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying pathfinding system of TrinityCore, which
    uses navmesh data for accurate navigation checks. Performance can be impacted
    by complex terrain or high-density obstacles in the map. The method does not account
    for dynamic objects that may block movement at runtime but are not part of the
    static navmesh.
  warnings: Ensure that both points 'a' and 'b' represent valid locations within the
    provided map's coordinate system. Passing invalid coordinates or null map pointers
    will result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. This function should
    not be used for real-time movement validation during active pathing, as it may
    not reflect dynamic changes in the environment.
