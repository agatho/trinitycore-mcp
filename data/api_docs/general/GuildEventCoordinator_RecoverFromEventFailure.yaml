  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::RecoverFromEventFailure(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover guild event state from a failed event execution.
  description: The RecoverFromEventFailure method is designed to handle cleanup and
    state restoration when a guild event fails during execution. This method likely
    resets internal event tracking, notifies relevant subsystems of the failure, and
    prepares the guild event coordinator for subsequent event processing. It may also
    trigger recovery mechanisms such as retry logic or rollback operations depending
    on the specific event type and configuration. The method operates on a specified
    event ID to determine which event's state needs to be recovered.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event that failed. This parameter
      determines which event's state will be recovered and reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Recovery Usage
    code: "void HandleGuildEventFailure(GuildEventCoordinator* coordinator, uint32\
      \ failedEventId) {\n    coordinator->RecoverFromEventFailure(failedEventId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Recovery with Error Logging
    code: "void ProcessGuildEventWithErrorHandling(GuildEventCoordinator* coordinator,\
      \ uint32 eventId) {\n    try {\n        // ... event execution logic ...\n \
      \   } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Guild event\
      \ %u failed: %s\", eventId, e.what());\n        coordinator->RecoverFromEventFailure(eventId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal state cleanup and may interact with
    database persistence to reset event tracking. It's expected to be called after
    an event execution has failed, typically as part of a broader error handling mechanism
    within the guild event system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper event failure context may lead to inconsistent
    state or unexpected behavior in the guild event coordinator. Ensure that eventId
    corresponds to a legitimately failed event before invoking this recovery mechanism.
