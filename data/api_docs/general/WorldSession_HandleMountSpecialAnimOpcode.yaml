  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleMountSpecialAnimOpcode
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleMountSpecialAnimOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::MountSpecial
    & mountSpecial)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the mount special animation opcode sent by the client.
  description: This method processes the MountSpecialAnimOpcode received from a client
    session, which is triggered when a player performs a special mount animation.
    The method likely validates the incoming packet data and initiates the corresponding
    visual effect on the player's character. It is part of the WorldSession's packet
    handling system and typically occurs during gameplay when a player mounts or dismounts
    using special mount animations such as those for flying mounts or unique pet animations.
    This method does not return any value but may trigger additional game state changes
    or network events.
  parameters:
  - name: mountSpecial
    description: A reference to the MountSpecial packet structure containing data
      about the special mount animation being performed by the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMountSpecialAnimOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::MountSpecial\
      \ & mountSpecial)\n{\n    // Process the mount special animation\n    // Validate\
      \ packet data\n    // Trigger visual effect on player character\n    // Send\
      \ updated state to other players in range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the WorldSession's packet handling
    loop. It should be thread-safe as it operates on session-specific data. The actual
    animation logic may involve sending updates to nearby players or triggering server-side
    effects.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode could lead to visual desynchronization
    between client and server, potentially causing incorrect mount animations or character
    state issues. Ensure all packet validation is performed before processing.
