  method: IsOptimalComposition
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::IsOptimalComposition() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current AI behavior composition meets optimal criteria
    for mob engagement.
  description: The IsOptimalComposition method evaluates the current state of adaptive
    AI behaviors within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager to determine if the active set
    of behaviors forms an optimal configuration for mob engagement. This method typically
    checks factors such as behavior balance, threat distribution, and overall tactical
    effectiveness. It is used internally by the AI system to decide when to switch
    between different behavioral strategies or maintain the current composition. The
    evaluation considers various parameters including player proximity, threat levels,
    and environmental conditions that influence optimal AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current AI behavior composition is considered optimal
    for mob engagement, false otherwise. An optimal composition typically indicates
    that the behaviors are well-balanced, appropriately responsive to threats, and
    aligned with the tactical goals of the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.IsOptimalComposition())\n{\n    // Continue\
      \ with current behavior composition\n    return;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Trigger\
      \ behavior reconfiguration\n    adaptiveBehaviorManager.RecalculateBehaviors();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during AI update cycles and should
    be optimized for performance. The definition of 'optimal' may vary based on game
    mechanics, difficulty settings, or specific mob types. Implementation details
    are tied to internal behavior scoring algorithms that weight various tactical
    factors.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method's return value for critical gameplay decisions
    without considering the broader AI context. The optimal composition may change
    rapidly in dynamic combat scenarios, so frequent checks might be necessary but
    could impact performance.
