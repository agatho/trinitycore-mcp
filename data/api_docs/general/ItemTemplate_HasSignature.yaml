documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template has a signature associated with it.
  description: The HasSignature method checks if an ItemTemplate object contains a
    valid signature. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, item signatures are used
    to identify unique crafted items or items with special properties that distinguish
    them from regular drops. This method returns true if the item template has been
    assigned a signature, and false otherwise. The signature is typically set during
    item creation or modification processes and can be used for tracking, identification,
    or game mechanic purposes such as preventing duplication or enabling special item
    behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template has a signature assigned; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (itemTemplate->HasSignature()) {\n    // Handle item with signature\n\
      \    printf(\"Item has a signature\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle item without\
      \ signature\n    printf(\"Item does not have a signature\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Signature
    code: "void ProcessItem(ItemTemplate* itemTemplate) {\n    if (itemTemplate->HasSignature())\
      \ {\n        // Apply special handling for signed items\n        ApplyUniqueEffects(itemTemplate);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Standard processing for unsigned items\n        ApplyStandardEffects(itemTemplate);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in item creation, modification, and validation
    logic. The signature field may be set during item generation or when an item is
    enchanted or modified by a player. Performance-wise, this is a simple boolean
    check and should not cause any noticeable overhead.
