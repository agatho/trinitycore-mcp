api:
  class: Creature
  method: GetCurrentEquipmentId
  signature: uint8 Creature::GetCurrentEquipmentId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current equipment ID of the creature, which determines the equipment
    set used for combat.
  description: The GetCurrentEquipmentId method retrieves the unique identifier that
    represents the current equipment set being used by the creature. This value is
    crucial for determining which specific equipment configuration the creature should
    use during combat, particularly in scenarios where multiple equipment sets are
    defined for a single creature. The method returns an integer value that corresponds
    to one of the predefined equipment IDs, typically ranging from 0 to 2, depending
    on how many equipment sets are configured for the creature. This ID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to select the appropriate equipment configuration during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the current equipment ID, which corresponds
    to one of the three possible equipment sets (0, 1, or 2) defined for the creature.
    The value indicates which equipment set is currently active and being used by
    the creature during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 equipmentId = creature->GetCurrentEquipmentId();\nif (equipmentId\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Creature is using first equipment set\n}\nelse if (equipmentId\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Creature is using second equipment set\n}\nelse if (equipmentId\
      \ == 2)\n{\n    // Creature is using third equipment set\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature equipment-related
    methods to determine which equipment configuration should be applied during combat.
    The value returned by this method directly influences the creature's behavior
    during combat and can affect the outcome of encounters.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining the actual equipment items
    being used, as it only returns the ID of the equipment set, not the actual items
    themselves. Additionally, this method may return 0 even if no equipment sets are
    defined for the creature, so developers should verify that the creature actually
    has equipment sets configured before relying on this value.
