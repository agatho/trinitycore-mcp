  brief: Clears quest objectives associated with a spell effect.
  description: The EffectQuestClear method is responsible for removing or clearing
    quest objectives that are linked to a specific spell effect. This method typically
    operates within the context of World of Warcraft's quest system, where spells
    may be used to trigger or complete quest objectives. It ensures that any quest-related
    data associated with the spell effect is properly reset, allowing players to progress
    through quests or reengage with quest givers without conflicts. The method may
    also handle cleanup of quest-related variables or states in preparation for subsequent
    quest actions.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell effect processing and may be
    part of a larger spell handling system. Developers should be aware that this method
    might be called in different contexts depending on the type of spell being processed,
    and it should be used carefully to avoid unintended quest state changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to quest state inconsistencies or
    prevent players from completing quests properly. It is important to ensure that
    quest-related data is correctly cleared before calling this method.
