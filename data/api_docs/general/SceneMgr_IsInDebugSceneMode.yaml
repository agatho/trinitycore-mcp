documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the scene manager is currently operating in debug mode.
  description: The IsInDebugSceneMode method checks if the scene manager is currently
    running in debug mode. This mode is typically enabled during development or debugging
    sessions to provide additional logging, visualization, or behavior modifications
    for scene-related operations. The method returns a boolean value indicating the
    current state of the debug flag within the scene manager. This functionality is
    primarily used by developers and administrators to enable enhanced debugging capabilities
    for scene-based systems in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scene manager is currently in debug mode; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Debug Scene Mode Status
    code: "if (sSceneMgr->IsInDebugSceneMode())\n{\n    // Perform debug-specific\
      \ actions\n    sLog->outString(\"Scene manager is in debug mode.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore framework to conditionally
    enable or disable certain debugging features during scene processing. The debug
    mode may affect performance and should not be enabled in production environments
    unless specifically required for troubleshooting.
