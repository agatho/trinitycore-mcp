  method: _RewardPlayer
  signature: void KillRewarder::_RewardPlayer(Player * player, bool isDungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards a player with experience, gold, and loot upon defeating a creature
    or completing a kill objective in a dungeon or regular encounter.
  description: The _RewardPlayer method is responsible for distributing rewards to
    a Player object after they have successfully killed a creature or completed a
    kill-based objective. These rewards typically include experience points, gold
    currency, and item drops based on the difficulty of the encounter and the player's
    role in the fight. The method distinguishes between dungeon and non-dungeon encounters,
    potentially adjusting reward values or applying specific dungeon-related modifiers.
    This function is usually invoked internally by the game's combat and quest systems
    when a kill event occurs, ensuring that players are appropriately compensated
    for their efforts.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object who has earned the reward. Must be
      a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: isDungeon
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the kill occurred within a dungeon
      environment. If true, rewards may be scaled or modified according to dungeon-specific
      rules such as group size, difficulty, and instance bonuses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat handler
    code: "void OnCreatureKilled(Creature* creature, Player* player)\n{\n    KillRewarder\
      \ rewarder;\n    rewarder._RewardPlayer(player, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dungeon kill reward with dungeon flag
    code: "void OnBossDefeated(BossCreature* boss, Group* group)\n{\n    for (auto&\
      \ member : group->GetMembers())\n    {\n        KillRewarder rewarder;\n   \
      \     rewarder._RewardPlayer(member->GetPlayer(), true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal systems such as the player's quest
    log, loot tables, and experience calculation logic. It may also trigger additional
    events or updates related to achievements or reputation. Developers should ensure
    that the Player pointer is valid before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the Player pointer can
    lead to crashes or memory corruption. The 'isDungeon' parameter directly affects
    reward scaling, so incorrect usage may cause players to receive inappropriate
    rewards.
