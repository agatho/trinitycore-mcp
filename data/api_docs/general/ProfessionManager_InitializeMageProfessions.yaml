documentation:
  brief: Initializes all mage-related professions and their associated skills for
    a player.
  description: The InitializeMageProfessions method sets up and configures all profession-related
    data specific to mages within the TrinityCore framework. This includes loading,
    initializing, or registering mage-specific crafting professions such as Enchanting,
    Engineering, and other relevant skills that are unique to the mage class. The
    method ensures that players with mage characters have access to their appropriate
    profession trees and associated abilities upon character initialization or login.
    It typically handles internal data structures and game state management required
    for these professions to function correctly within the game mechanics.

      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during character loading or login process
    to ensure mage-specific professions are properly initialized. It may interact
