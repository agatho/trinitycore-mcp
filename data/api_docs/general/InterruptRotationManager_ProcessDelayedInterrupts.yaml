  method: ProcessDelayedInterrupts
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::ProcessDelayedInterrupts()
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes any queued interrupt actions that were delayed due
    to timing or state constraints.
  description: The ProcessDelayedInterrupts method is responsible for handling interrupt
    actions that have been postponed, typically due to game state restrictions or
    timing requirements. This method iterates through a queue of delayed interrupts
    and executes them in the appropriate context, ensuring proper synchronization
    with the current combat or AI state. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the
    integrity of spell casting sequences and interrupt handling within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method assumes that all necessary preconditions for interrupt execution
    have been validated prior to invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_interruptManager->ProcessDelayedInterrupts();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the main game loop or when
    it's safe to process interrupts without causing race conditions. It is typically
    invoked during AI update cycles or spell processing phases.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate contexts may lead to undefined
    behavior, especially if interrupt handling requires specific state validation
    or synchronization.
