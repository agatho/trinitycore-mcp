  class: WorldSession
  method: KickPlayer
  signature: void WorldSession::KickPlayer(const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Kicks the player from the server with an optional reason message.
  description: The KickPlayer method terminates the connection of the associated player
    session, effectively removing them from the game world. This action is typically
    invoked by game masters or administrative systems to enforce rules, handle rule
    violations, or manage server resources. The method sends a kick message to the
    client before disconnecting the session. It does not perform any validation on
    the reason string and will use it as-is in the kick packet. The player's session
    state is immediately changed to disconnected, and all pending operations are cancelled.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: A string describing the reason for the kick. This message is sent
      to the client and displayed in their logout screen. Should be a human-readable
      explanation of why the player was kicked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Kick Usage
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->KickPlayer(\"\
      You have been banned for cheating.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Kick with Dynamic Reason
    code: "std::string reason = \"Account violation detected. Please contact support.\"\
      ;\nWorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->KickPlayer(reason);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from game master commands or automated moderation
    systems. It immediately terminates the session and cannot be undone once executed.
    The reason string is sent directly to the client without sanitization, so ensure
    it's properly formatted before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null session pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the player has an active session before invoking
    KickPlayer. Be cautious with dynamic strings passed as reasons, as they may contain
    special characters or be used in logging systems.
