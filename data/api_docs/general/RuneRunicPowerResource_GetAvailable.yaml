documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available runic power amount for a player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current amount of runic power
    that is available for use by a player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this value represents the player's active runic power resource, which is used
    to cast certain abilities and spells. The returned value typically ranges from
    0 to 1000, where 0 indicates no available runic power and 1000 represents full
    resource capacity. This method is commonly used in conjunction with other runic
    power management functions to determine spell casting eligibility and resource
    consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current amount of available runic power,
    typically ranging from 0 to 1000
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available runic power
    code: "uint32 availablePower = player->GetRuneRunicPowerResource()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (availablePower >= 500)\n{\n    // Player has sufficient runic power to cast\
      \ a spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_STRIKE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using available runic power in resource management
    code: "RuneRunicPowerResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneRunicPowerResource();\n\
      uint32 currentAvailable = runeResource->GetAvailable();\nuint32 maxAvailable\
      \ = runeResource->GetMax();\n\nif (currentAvailable > 0)\n{\n    // Calculate\
      \ percentage of resource available\n    float percentage = (float)currentAvailable\
      \ / (float)maxAvailable * 100.0f;\n    sLog->outString(\"Runic Power: %.2f%%\"\
      , percentage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current runic power state and does
    not account for any pending resource changes or animations. The value returned
    is directly tied to the player's current rune system state, which may be modified
    by various game events such as spell casting, ability usage, or resource regeneration.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a cached value and may not reflect immediate
    changes in runic power due to ongoing game mechanics. For real-time resource calculations,
    consider using additional methods like GetMax() or checking the player's current
    rune state before performing actions that consume resources.
