  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: GetRandomGenderForRace
  signature: uint8 BotCharacterDistribution::GetRandomGenderForRace(uint8 race)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a random gender value for the specified race.
  description: The GetRandomGenderForRace method selects and returns a valid gender
    (0 for male, 1 for female) appropriate for the given race. This method is typically
    used in bot character creation or randomization logic to ensure that generated
    characters have valid gender-race combinations. The implementation likely consults
    internal data structures or lookup tables that define which genders are available
    for each race in the game. It's important to note that not all races may support
    both genders, and this method ensures compliance with game rules and restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier (uint8) for which to retrieve a random gender.
      Valid values correspond to the standard World of Warcraft race IDs (e.g., 1
      = Human, 2 = Orc, etc.).
  returns: 'Returns a uint8 value representing the gender: 0 for male, 1 for female.
    The returned value is guaranteed to be valid for the specified race.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint8 gender = botDistribution->GetRandomGenderForRace(1); // Gets a random
      gender for Human race
    language: cpp
  - title: Character Creation Example
    code: 'uint8 race = 3; // Night Elf

      uint8 gender = botDistribution->GetRandomGenderForRace(race);

      // Use gender to create a random Night Elf character

      Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGender(gender);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game data tables that define valid
    gender-race combinations. Developers should be aware that certain races (like
    the Forsaken or Blood Elves) may have specific gender restrictions in some contexts,
    though generally all playable races support both genders.
  warnings: Ensure that the race parameter passed is a valid World of Warcraft race
    ID to avoid undefined behavior. While this method returns a valid gender, it does
    not validate whether the combination makes sense for character creation rules
    beyond basic gender-race compatibility.
