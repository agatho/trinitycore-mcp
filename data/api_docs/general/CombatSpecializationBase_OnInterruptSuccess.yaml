  method: OnInterruptSuccess
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::OnInterruptSuccess(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the successful interruption of a spell cast by the target unit.
  description: The OnInterruptSuccess method is invoked when a combat specialization
    successfully interrupts an enemy's spell casting. This method typically executes
    after a successful interrupt attempt, allowing custom behavior to be defined for
    what happens when a spell is interrupted. It is part of the combat specialization
    system in TrinityCore, which enables class-specific or specialization-based combat
    mechanics. The method receives a pointer to the target unit whose spell cast was
    interrupted, and can perform actions such as applying effects, modifying unit
    state, or triggering additional abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      was interrupted. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      unit in the game world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Success Handler
    code: "class MyCombatSpecialization : public CombatSpecializationBase {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnInterruptSuccess(Unit* target) override {\n        // Apply a debuff\
      \ to the interrupted target\n        target->AddAura(12345, target); // Example\
      \ aura ID\n        // Log the event\n        sLog->outString(\"Spell interrupted\
      \ on %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt with Conditional Logic
    code: "class MyCombatSpecialization : public CombatSpecializationBase {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnInterruptSuccess(Unit* target) override {\n        if (target &&\
      \ target->IsPlayer()) {\n            // Apply a different effect for players\n\
      \            target->AddAura(67890, target);\n        } else {\n           \
      \ // Apply a generic effect for NPCs\n            target->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 54321, true);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core interrupt logic of TrinityCore.
    Developers should ensure that any effects applied during this method do not cause
    recursion or infinite loops. The target parameter is guaranteed to be a valid
    Unit object at the time of invocation.
  warnings: Do not modify the target unit's state in a way that could invalidate the
    interrupt process or cause crashes. Avoid performing heavy operations within this
    method as it may affect performance during combat.
