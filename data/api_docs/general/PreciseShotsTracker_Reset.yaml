    when a player's shot ability is reinitialized or when the tracking system needs
    to be cleared before starting a new sequence of shots. The method ensures that
    any accumulated shot data or counters are cleared, allowing for accurate tracking
    of subsequent shots. It does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
