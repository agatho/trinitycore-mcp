  class: InteractionValidator
  method: ShouldBankItem
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ShouldBankItem(::Player * bot, ::Item * item)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item should be moved to the player's bank inventory.
  description: The ShouldBankItem method evaluates whether a given item in a player's
    inventory meets certain criteria that would make it suitable for placement in
    the bank. This decision is typically based on factors such as item type, value,
    rarity, and the bot's current inventory management strategy. The method is commonly
    used by AI systems or automated scripts to optimize inventory organization by
    transferring less critical items to the bank. It ensures that only appropriate
    items are considered for banking, maintaining the player's active inventory with
    essential gear while freeing up space.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or character whose
      inventory is being evaluated.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that is being assessed for potential banking.
  returns: Returns true if the item should be moved to the bank, false otherwise.
    The decision may depend on item properties such as value, type, and the bot's
    configured banking rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (validator.ShouldBankItem(bot, item)) {\n    // Move item to bank\n\
      \    bot->MoveItemToBank(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Inventory Management
    code: "for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_INVENTORY_SLOT; ++i) {\n    Item* item = bot->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0,\
      \ i);\n    if (item && validator.ShouldBankItem(bot, item)) {\n        bot->MoveItemToBank(item);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot behavior settings and inventory
    management configurations. It is part of a larger system for automated inventory
    optimization in TrinityCore-based bots or AI systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the item and bot pointers are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The decision logic may vary depending on the specific
    bot configuration or AI module being used.
