  signature: void KitingManager::AdaptPatternToSituation()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the kiting pattern based on current combat and environmental conditions.
  description: The AdaptPatternToSituation method dynamically modifies the kiting
    behavior of a unit in response to changing battlefield circumstances. It evaluates
    factors such as enemy positioning, available movement space, threat levels, and
    player capabilities to determine the most effective kiting strategy. This method
    is typically invoked during active combat scenarios where adaptive movement patterns
    are required for optimal survival and damage output. The implementation may consider
    variables like distance to target, line of sight, terrain features, and cooldown
    states of abilities that influence kiting effectiveness.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_unit->IsInCombat())\n        m_kitingManager->AdaptPatternToSituation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    regularly during active combat. It may trigger internal state changes that affect
    movement pathfinding and ability usage timing.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat context might lead to unexpected
    behavior or performance degradation due to unnecessary recalculations. Ensure
    proper locking mechanisms if used in multithreaded environments.
