  class: GroupCoordination
  method: CoordinateDispelling
  signature: void GroupCoordination::CoordinateDispelling(const int & debuffTypes)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates and manages the dispelling of debuffs within a group context.
  description: The CoordinateDispelling method is responsible for handling the coordination
    of debuff dispelling actions across members of a group in World of Warcraft. This
    method likely interfaces with the group's cooldown management, spell casting logic,
    and player state synchronization to ensure that debuffs are properly removed according
    to game rules and group coordination protocols. It may also handle priority ordering
    of dispels, validation of dispel targets, and communication of dispel events to
    other group members or the game server. The method operates within the GroupCoordination
    class which manages various group-based activities and interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: debuffTypes
    description: An integer parameter representing the types of debuffs to be dispelled.
      This value likely corresponds to a bitmask or enumeration defining specific
      debuff categories such as magic, curse, poison, disease, or physical debuffs.
      The exact mapping would depend on the internal implementation and game mechanics.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debuff Dispelling Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordination groupCoord;

      const int magicDebuffs = 1 << 0; // Bitmask for magic debuffs

      groupCoord.CoordinateDispelling(magicDebuffs);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Debuff Types Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordination groupCoord;

      const int allDebuffs = (1 << 0) | (1 << 1) | (1 << 2); // Magic, Curse, Poison

      groupCoord.CoordinateDispelling(allDebuffs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves synchronization with the game server to ensure
    all group members are aware of dispel actions. It may also implement cooldown
    tracking for dispel abilities to prevent spamming. The debuffTypes parameter should
    be validated against known debuff categories to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the debuffTypes bitmask could result in attempting
    to dispel invalid or unsupported debuff types, potentially causing errors or unexpected
    behavior in group coordination. This method should only be called when within
    a valid group context.
