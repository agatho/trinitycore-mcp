  class: BotProfiler
  method: GenerateCallStackReport
  signature: void BotProfiler::GenerateCallStackReport(const std::shared_ptr<ProfileCallFrame>
    & rootFrame, std::string & report)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a call stack report from the provided root frame and stores it
    in the given string reference.
  description: The GenerateCallStackReport method constructs a detailed textual representation
    of the call stack starting from the specified root frame. This functionality is
    typically used for profiling bot behavior within the TrinityCore framework, allowing
    developers to analyze execution paths and performance bottlenecks. The report
    includes information about each frame in the call stack such as function names,
    line numbers, and timing data if available. It is designed to be thread-safe and
    does not modify the original frame structure. This method assumes that the provided
    rootFrame is valid and properly initialized with relevant profiling data.
  parameters:
  - name: rootFrame
    description: A shared pointer to the root frame of the call stack to be reported.
      Must not be null and should contain valid profiling data for accurate reporting.
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated call stack report will
      be stored. The string is overwritten with the new report content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<ProfileCallFrame> root = std::make_shared<ProfileCallFrame>();

      std::string report;

      botProfiler.GenerateCallStackReport(root, report);

      // report now contains the formatted call stack information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for debugging and performance analysis purposes.
    The call stack frames must be properly populated with timing and function data
    before calling this method. It may include additional metadata like timestamps
    or memory usage if supported by the underlying profiling infrastructure.
