  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetProcRemainingTime
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetProcRemainingTime(uint32 procId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for a specific proc effect.
  description: The GetProcRemainingTime method retrieves the duration remaining for
    a specified proc effect associated with the combat specialization. This method
    is typically used to determine how much time is left before a proc effect expires
    or resets. The returned value represents the time in milliseconds, which can be
    used for UI display, cooldown tracking, or game logic decisions. The method assumes
    that the procId corresponds to a valid active proc within the combat specialization's
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: procId
    description: The unique identifier of the proc effect for which to retrieve the
      remaining time. This ID should correspond to an active proc in the combat specialization's
      internal tracking system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the milliseconds remaining for the
    specified proc effect. If the procId does not correspond to an active proc, the
    method may return 0 or an undefined value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 remainingTime = combatSpec->GetProcRemainingTime(12345);\nif (remainingTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proc is still active, use remainingTime for UI or logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Proc expires in %u ms\\n\", remainingTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Tracking
    code: "uint32 procId = 54321;\nuint32 timeLeft = combatSpec->GetProcRemainingTime(procId);\n\
      if (timeLeft == 0)\n{\n    // Proc has expired or is not active\n    printf(\"\
      Proc is no longer active\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Update cooldown display\n\
      \    cooldownDisplay->SetRemainingTime(timeLeft);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of proc effects. It should
    only be called when the combat specialization is properly initialized and has
    active procs. The method may return 0 if the specified procId is not found or
    has already expired.
  warnings: Ensure that the procId parameter corresponds to a valid proc within the
    combat specialization's scope. Using an invalid procId may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect time values.
