  class: CollectionMgr
  method: SetAppearanceIsFavorite
  signature: void CollectionMgr::SetAppearanceIsFavorite(uint32 itemModifiedAppearanceId,
    bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a specific item appearance is marked as favorite for the player.
  description: The SetAppearanceIsFavorite method toggles the favorite status of a
    given item appearance ID for the player's collection. This functionality allows
    players to mark certain appearances (such as cosmetic items, mounts, pets, or
    gear skins) as favorites, which can be used for quick access or organization within
    the game's UI. The method operates on the itemModifiedAppearanceId parameter,
    which uniquely identifies a specific appearance variant of an item. When apply
    is true, the appearance is added to the favorites list; when false, it is removed
    from the favorites list. This action typically affects the player's collection
    data and may trigger UI updates or database persistence.
  parameters:
  - name: itemModifiedAppearanceId
    description: A unique identifier for a specific item appearance variant. This
      ID corresponds to an entry in the ItemModifiedAppearance table and represents
      how an item looks (e.g., color, model variation) rather than the base item itself.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the favorite status.
      If true, the appearance is marked as a favorite; if false, it is removed from
      favorites.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Mark an Appearance as Favorite
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->SetAppearanceIsFavorite(12345, true); // Mark appearance ID 12345
      as favorite'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove an Appearance from Favorites
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->SetAppearanceIsFavorite(67890, false); // Remove appearance ID
      67890 from favorites'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's saved collection data in the
    database and may trigger UI refreshes to reflect the updated favorite status.
    It should only be called when the player has access to the relevant appearance,
    otherwise it might silently fail or have no effect.
  warnings: Ensure that itemModifiedAppearanceId is valid before calling this method;
    invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. This method
    does not validate whether the player owns the appearance, so calling it on unowned
    appearances may result in unexpected UI states.
