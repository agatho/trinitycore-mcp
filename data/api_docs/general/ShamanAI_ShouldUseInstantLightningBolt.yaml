  class: ShamanAI
  method: ShouldUseInstantLightningBolt
  signature: bool ShamanAI::ShouldUseInstantLightningBolt() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the shaman should use the Instant Lightning Bolt spell
    based on current combat conditions and resource availability.
  description: This method evaluates various factors such as available mana, target
    distance, and combat state to decide if using the Instant Lightning Bolt ability
    is optimal. It considers the shaman's current situation including whether they
    have sufficient resources and if the spell would be effective in the current scenario.
    The decision-making process involves checking for valid targets, ensuring enough
    mana for the spell, and confirming that the spell is not on cooldown or otherwise
    restricted by game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the shaman should use Instant Lightning Bolt; false otherwise.
    The method returns false when mana is insufficient, target is out of range, or
    other conditions prevent optimal usage of the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (shamanAI->ShouldUseInstantLightningBolt()) {\n    // Execute Instant\
      \ Lightning Bolt\n    shamanAI->DoCastVictim(SPELL_INSTANT_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldUseInstantLightningBolt())\
      \ {\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_INSTANT_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the shaman's combat decision-making system and should
    be called regularly during AI updates. The implementation likely checks against
    internal state variables such as mana level, target status, and spell cooldowns
    to make an informed decision about spell usage.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the shaman has a valid target
    and is in combat state. Calling it outside of proper combat conditions may lead
    to unexpected behavior or failed spell casts.
