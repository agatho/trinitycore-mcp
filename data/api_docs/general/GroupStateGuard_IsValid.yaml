documentation:
  brief: Checks if the group state guard is valid and active
  description: The IsValid method determines whether the GroupStateGuard object represents
    a currently valid group state. This guard is typically used to ensure that group
    operations are performed only when the group is in a consistent and valid state.
    The method performs internal validation checks on the group's state, including
    verifying that the group exists, is not destroyed, and that all members are properly
    initialized. It returns true if the group state is considered valid for further
    operations, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group state guard represents a valid and active group
    state, false if the group is invalid or has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (groupStateGuard.IsValid()) {\n    // Safe to perform group operations\n\
      \    group->SendUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Group state is invalid, skip operations\n\
      \    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Group state invalid, skipping update\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in group member management
    code: "void Player::UpdateGroupState() {\n    if (!groupStateGuard.IsValid())\
      \ {\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Perform safe group operations\n  \
      \  group->BroadcastPacket(packet);\n    group->UpdateMemberStats();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GroupStateGuard is designed to prevent invalid group operations that
    could lead to crashes or inconsistent state. It's particularly important when
    dealing with asynchronous operations where the group state might change between
    the time of check and execution. This guard typically performs lightweight validation
    checks rather than expensive operations.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for critical safety checks in performance-sensitive
    code paths, as it may perform internal state verification that could impact performance.
    The validity check is only as reliable as the underlying group state management
    system.
