  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void CooldownEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the cooldown event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI instance from the
    cooldown event bus, effectively disconnecting it from receiving any further cooldown-related
    events. This is typically used when a bot is being destroyed or deactivated to
    prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions. The method
    operates on a list or collection of subscribers maintained by the CooldownEventBus
    class, removing the provided subscriber if it exists in that collection.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the cooldown
      event bus. Must not be null; passing a null pointer may result in undefined
      behavior or crashes.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... bot initialization and subscription code ...

      cooldownBus.Subscribe(myBot);

      // ... later in the code ...

      cooldownBus.Unsubscribe(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the subscriber has previously been subscribed to
    the event bus via the Subscribe method. It's important to ensure that all subscriptions
    are properly unsubscribed before deleting a BotAI instance to avoid dangling pointers
    or access violations.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the subscriber parameter may lead to undefined
    behavior. Additionally, calling Unsubscribe on an already unsubscribed BotAI instance
    might cause issues if the implementation does not check for duplicate removals.
