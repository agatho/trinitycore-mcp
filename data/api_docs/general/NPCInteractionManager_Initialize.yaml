  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the NPC interaction manager system, setting up internal data
    structures and registering necessary event handlers for NPC dialogue and quest
    interactions.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the NPCInteractionManager class for
    operation by constructing internal lookup tables, registering event listeners
    for player-NPC interactions, and initializing any required subsystems. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when a new instance of the manager
    needs to be activated. It ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and
    that the system is ready to handle incoming NPC interaction requests from players.
    The initialization process may involve loading configuration data, setting up
    callback functions, and preparing caches for efficient lookup of NPC behavior
    scripts. This method should only be called once per instance unless followed by
    a Reset or Shutdown call.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager interactionManager;

      interactionManager.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no thread synchronization internally, so it should be
    called from a single-threaded context during initialization. The manager will
    not process any NPC interactions until this method is successfully invoked.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper shutdown may lead to
    resource leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that all previous instances are properly
    cleaned up before reinitializing.
