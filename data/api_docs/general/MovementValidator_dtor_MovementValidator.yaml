documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MovementValidator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~MovementValidator destructor is automatically invoked when a MovementValidator
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, or references held
    by the validator. In the context of TrinityCore's movement system, this may involve
    releasing locks, clearing cached movement data, or notifying other subsystems
    about the validator's destruction. The destructor is typically called as part
    of normal object lifecycle management and does not require explicit invocation
    by developers.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    MovementValidator validator;\n    // ... use\
      \ validator ...\n} // destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'MovementValidator* validator = new MovementValidator();

      // ... use validator ...

      delete validator; // triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It should not be called directly unless performing explicit
    object deletion. The destruction process may involve internal cleanup routines
    that are not exposed to public API.
