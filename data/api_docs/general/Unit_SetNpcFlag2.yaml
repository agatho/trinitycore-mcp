documentation:
  brief: Sets the NPC flags2 for a unit, controlling advanced NPC behavior and interaction
    settings.
  description: This method allows developers to set the NPCFlags2 value for a Unit
    object, which determines various advanced NPC behaviors including quest interaction,
    vendor interactions, and other specialized game mechanics. The NPCFlags2 value
    is used in conjunction with other NPC flag values to control how NPCs interact
    with players and what actions they can perform. This method is typically used
    during NPC creation or modification to define specific behaviors for non-player
    characters within the World of Warcraft environment.

    code: 'Unit* npc = new Unit();

      pc->SetNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2::NPC_FLAG_VENDOR);

    language: cpp
  - title: Setting multiple NPC flags2
    code: 'Unit* npc = new Unit();

      pc->SetNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2::NPC_FLAG_VENDOR | NPCFlags2::NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal NPC flags value of a unit. It
    should be used carefully as it affects how NPCs behave in relation to player interactions,
    questing, and other game mechanics. The method is typically called during NPC
    initialization or modification.
