documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the temporary summon will be dismissed when the owner
    mounts a flying creature.
  description: This method checks if the temporary summon is configured to automatically
    dismiss itself when its owner (player) mounts a flying mount. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, certain summoned creatures such as pets or guardians
    may have logic that causes them to disappear when the player begins riding a flying
    mount. This behavior is typically used for summoned companions that are not meant
    to accompany the player while flying, like ground-based pets or specific quest-related
    summons. The method returns true if dismissal on flying mount is enabled for this
    summon, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the temporary summon will be dismissed
    when the owner mounts a flying creature. Returns true if the summon is set to
    dismiss on flying mount, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Summon Dismisses on Flying Mount
    code: "if (tempSummon->IsDismissedOnFlyingMount()) {\n    // Handle logic for\
      \ dismissing summon\n    tempSummon->UnSummon();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Summon Behavior Based on Mount Status
    code: "Player* player = tempSummon->GetOwner()->ToPlayer();\nif (player && player->IsFlying())\
      \ {\n    if (tempSummon->IsDismissedOnFlyingMount()) {\n        tempSummon->UnSummon();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with summon management systems
    and mount-related event handling. The behavior can be controlled via summon templates
    or AI settings in the database or through script logic.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's result for critical gameplay
    mechanics, as summon dismissal logic may vary depending on specific summon types
    or custom implementations.
