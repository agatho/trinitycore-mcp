  class: ExampleManager
  method: ProcessTask
  signature: bool ExampleManager::ProcessTask(const Task & task)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a given task and returns true if successful, false otherwise
  description: The ProcessTask method handles the execution of a specified task within
    the ExampleManager class. It validates the task parameters, performs necessary
    operations based on the task type, and returns a boolean indicating success or
    failure. This method is typically used in the context of managing asynchronous
    operations or queued tasks within the TrinityCore framework. The method may involve
    database interactions, world state updates, or other game logic depending on the
    task definition. Precondition checks ensure that the task is valid before processing
    begins.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: The Task object to be processed. This parameter contains all necessary
      information about the task including its type, data, and execution context.
      The task must be properly initialized and contain valid data for successful
      processing.
  returns: True if the task was successfully processed, false if the task failed during
    processing or validation. A return value of false typically indicates an error
    condition such as invalid task parameters, missing dependencies, or execution
    failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Task Processing
    code: "ExampleManager manager;\nTask myTask;\nmyTask.type = TASK_TYPE_UPDATE;\n\
      myTask.data = \"some_data\";\nbool result = manager.ProcessTask(myTask);\nif\
      \ (result)\n{\n    // Task processed successfully\n    printf(\"Task completed\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Task failed to process\n    printf(\"\
      Task processing failed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Task Processing
    code: "ExampleManager manager;\nTask invalidTask;\ninvalidTask.type = TASK_TYPE_INVALID;\n\
      bool result = manager.ProcessTask(invalidTask);\nif (!result)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ the error case\n    printf(\"Invalid task type encountered\\n\");\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Process successful task\n    printf(\"Task processed successfully\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from multiple
    threads simultaneously. The implementation should handle concurrent access properly,
    especially when dealing with shared resources or global state updates. Performance
    considerations include minimizing database queries and avoiding blocking operations
    within the processing loop.
  warnings: Do not call this method with uninitialized or corrupted Task objects as
    it may lead to undefined behavior. Always validate task parameters before passing
    them to this method. Be aware that certain task types might have side effects
    on game state, so ensure proper error handling is in place.
