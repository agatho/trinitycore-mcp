documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot joins a group in the EnhancedBotAI system
  description: The OnGroupJoined method is triggered when a bot successfully joins
    a group within the EnhancedBotAI framework. This method is responsible for initializing
    group-related behaviors, updating internal state tracking, and potentially notifying
    other subsystems about the new group composition. The method typically performs
    setup operations such as registering the bot with group management systems, synchronizing
    group-specific data, and preparing the bot to participate in group activities
    like raids or dungeons. It serves as a critical integration point for maintaining
    consistent AI behavior across group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the group identifier that the
      bot has joined. This value is used internally by the EnhancedBotAI system to
      track and manage group membership.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot initialization
    code: "void MyBot::Initialize()\n{\n    // Simulate joining a group\n    int groupId\
      \ = 12345;\n    m_AI->OnGroupJoined(&groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling group join with error checking
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupJoined(int* group)\n{\n    if (!group || *group\
      \ <= 0)\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid group ID provided to OnGroupJoined\"\
      );\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Proceed with group initialization logic\n\
      \    m_currentGroup = *group;\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot joined group %d\",\
      \ *group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when a bot's group membership changes. Developers should ensure that any custom
    logic implemented in this method does not block or delay execution, as it may
    affect overall AI responsiveness. The group parameter is expected to be a valid
    identifier that has already been registered with the group management system.
  warnings: Do not modify the group pointer value directly within this method, as
    it may cause inconsistencies in group tracking. Also, avoid performing heavy computations
    or blocking operations inside this handler to prevent performance degradation
    of the AI system.
