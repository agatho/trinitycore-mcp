  class: MonkAI
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void MonkAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for Monk abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages the internal cooldown tracking for
    a Monk AI character, processing the time elapsed since the last update to determine
    which abilities are now available for use. This method is typically called during
    the AI's update cycle and ensures that abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout
    Kick, and other cooldown-based skills are properly managed according to game mechanics.
    It handles decrementing internal timers and updating the state of the Monk's ability
    availability.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers based on real-time progression.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Cooldowns Call
    code: "void Update() override\n{\n    // Assuming this is part of a Monk AI update\
      \ loop\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n    {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \        // Other logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\n    // Proceed with normal AI\
      \ logic\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n        return;\n\n\
      \    // Use abilities based on cooldown state\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. It is essential for proper ability usage timing and
    prevents players from spamming abilities that have cooldowns.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context as it relies
    on accurate time delta values for proper cooldown calculation. Incorrect diff
    values will lead to inaccurate cooldown states.
