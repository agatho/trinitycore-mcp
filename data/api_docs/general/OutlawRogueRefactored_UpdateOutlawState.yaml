  method: UpdateOutlawState
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::UpdateOutlawState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the outlaw rogue's state based on current combat conditions and ability
    availability.
  description: The UpdateOutlawState method manages the internal state of an Outlaw
    Rogue class instance, determining which abilities or actions are currently available
    or active. This includes evaluating cooldowns, resource levels (such as energy
    or combo points), and combat context to ensure the rogue behaves according to
    the outlaw specialization's mechanics. The method is typically called during the
    AI update cycle or in response to specific game events that may alter the rogue's
    tactical state. It ensures that the rogue's behavior aligns with the rules of
    the Outlaw specialization, such as enabling or disabling certain abilities like
    Sinister Strike, Backstab, or Pistol Shot based on available resources and conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.UpdateOutlawState();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat AI Loop
    code: "void OutlawRogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    m_rogue.UpdateOutlawState();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked frequently during combat updates and should
    be optimized for performance. It may interact with internal state tracking variables
    such as ability cooldowns, combo point counts, and target status. Developers should
    ensure that any external dependencies (like player resource changes) are properly
    synchronized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling UpdateOutlawState() outside of a valid combat or AI update context
    might lead to inconsistent behavior or incorrect state transitions. Ensure that
    the rogue's current target and resources are in a consistent state before invoking
    this method.
