  class: GameObject
  method: GetWorldEffectID
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetWorldEffectID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the world effect ID associated with the game object.
  description: The GetWorldEffectID method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to a specific world effect or visual effect applied to the game object. This ID
    is typically used to determine which effect should be triggered when the object
    is interacted with, such as during quest events or when certain conditions are
    met. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    to manage the behavior and appearance of game objects within the World of Warcraft
    environment. It provides a way to access the underlying world effect data without
    direct manipulation of the object's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the world effect ID associated with this
    game object, which can be used to identify specific visual or functional effects
    applied to the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 worldEffectID = gameObject->GetWorldEffectID();\nif (worldEffectID\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the world effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    like GetGOData() or GetGOInfo() to retrieve complete information about a game
    object. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method,
    but it should be used carefully when iterating through large numbers of objects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the world effect
    ID may not be set or may be zero, as this could lead to incorrect behavior or
    missing effects in certain interactions.
