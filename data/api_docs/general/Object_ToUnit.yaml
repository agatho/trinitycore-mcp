documentation:
  brief: Converts an Object to a Unit pointer, allowing access to unit-specific properties
    and methods.
  description: The ToUnit method serves as a type conversion utility that allows developers
    to safely cast an Object instance to a Unit pointer when the Object is known to
    be a Unit. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore development
    to access unit-specific functionality such as combat behavior, AI logic, and unit-based
    attributes. The method performs a dynamic_cast operation internally, ensuring
    type safety while maintaining performance. It should only be called when the Object
    instance is confirmed to be a Unit, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior
    or null pointer dereferences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to a Unit object if the Object is indeed a Unit;
    otherwise returns nullptr. The returned pointer can be used to access unit-specific
    methods and properties without needing to perform additional type checking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = object->ToUnit();\nif (unit)\n{\n    // Unit is valid, proceed\
      \ with unit-specific operations\n    unit->GetHealth();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = object->ToUnit();\nif (unit && unit->IsAlive())\n{\n    //\
      \ Perform actions on alive unit\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_HOSTILE);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle null case or non-alive unit\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with dynamic_cast and should
    be avoided when possible to maintain performance. The method assumes that the
    Object instance is actually a Unit, so developers must ensure proper type checking
    before calling this method. It's recommended to use static_cast where appropriate
    for better performance.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-Unit objects may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always verify that the Object is a Unit before calling ToUnit, especially
    when dealing with dynamic objects such as those created through AI logic or summoned
    creatures.
