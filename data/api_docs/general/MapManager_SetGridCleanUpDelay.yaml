  class: MapManager
  method: SetGridCleanUpDelay
  signature: void MapManager::SetGridCleanUpDelay(uint32 t)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the grid cleanup delay for the map manager.
  description: The SetGridCleanUpDelay method configures the time interval (in milliseconds)
    that determines how long a grid remains active after all players have left it
    before being cleaned up. This is an important performance optimization in TrinityCore's
    map management system, as it prevents unnecessary memory allocation for grids
    that are no longer in use. The delay value affects how quickly inactive grids
    are removed from memory, balancing between resource usage and potential performance
    overhead from frequent grid creation/destruction cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The cleanup delay time in milliseconds. This value controls how long
      a grid will remain loaded in memory after the last player has left it before
      being eligible for cleanup.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Grid Cleanup Delay to 30 Seconds
    code: MapManager::Instance()->SetGridCleanUpDelay(30000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Grid Cleanup for Low-Resource Environment
    code: MapManager::Instance()->SetGridCleanUpDelay(60000); // 1 minute delay
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global grid cleanup behavior across all maps managed
    by the MapManager instance. The default value is typically set during server initialization
    based on configuration settings. Changing this value at runtime will immediately
    affect future grid cleanup operations, but already loaded grids will continue
    to follow their existing lifecycle.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause excessive grid creation/destruction
    cycles, leading to performance degradation. Setting it too high may result in
    unnecessary memory consumption as inactive grids remain loaded for extended periods.
