  signature: bool Spell::HasGlobalCooldown() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell has a global cooldown active.
  description: This method checks if the current spell instance has a global cooldown
    (GCD) applied, which is a fundamental gameplay mechanic in World of Warcraft.
    The GCD prevents players from casting another spell immediately after using one,
    typically lasting 1.5 seconds. This method returns true when the spell is currently
    subject to a global cooldown and false when it's not. It's commonly used for validation
    purposes during spell casting and cooldown management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has a global cooldown active, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell is currently restricted by the GCD mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->HasGlobalCooldown())\n{\n    // Do something\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cooldown-related
    methods to manage spell timing and prevent immediate re-casting. The implementation
    relies on internal spell state tracking rather than external data.
