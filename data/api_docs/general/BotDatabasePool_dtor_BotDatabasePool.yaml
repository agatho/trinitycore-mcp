  method: ~BotDatabasePool
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::~BotDatabasePool()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotDatabasePool instance and cleans up all associated database
    connections and resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotDatabasePool class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all database connections managed by this pool. It ensures that all
    active connections are closed, resources are freed, and any pending transactions
    are handled appropriately. This method is automatically invoked when a BotDatabasePool
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this destructor plays a crucial role in preventing memory leaks and
    maintaining database connection integrity when bot instances are terminated or
    destroyed.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotDatabasePool
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotDatabasePool pool;\n    // Use the pool...\n\
      \    // pool is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotDatabasePool
    code: 'BotDatabasePool* pool = new BotDatabasePool();

      // Use the pool...

      delete pool; // Triggers ~BotDatabasePool destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations in a thread-safe manner. It's
    important to ensure that no other threads are actively using connections from
    this pool when the destructor is called, as it may lead to undefined behavior
    or connection corruption.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly on an already destroyed object will result
    in undefined behavior. Additionally, if any database operations are still pending
    when the destructor is invoked, those operations might be abruptly terminated
    without proper cleanup.
