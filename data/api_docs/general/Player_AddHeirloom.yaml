documentation:
  brief: Adds a heirloom item to the player's collection
  description: The AddHeirloom method allows a player to add a specific heirloom item
    to their inventory. This method is typically used for adding heirloom items that
    are not normally obtainable through regular gameplay, such as those from custom
    content or special events. The method takes an itemId parameter which specifies
    the unique identifier of the heirloom item to be added, and flags parameter which
    defines the conditions under which the item should be added. It's important to
    note that this method does not automatically send the item to the player's inventory;
    rather, it sets up the necessary conditions for the item to be properly added.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the heirloom item to be added. This should
      correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: flags
    description: The flags that define how the heirloom item should be added. This
      could include conditions like whether the item is bound, or if it's added with
      specific enchantments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Heirloom Addition
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddHeirloom(12345, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Heirloom Addition with Flags
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddHeirloom(67890, 1);

      // This adds a heirloom with specific flags, such as binding or enchantment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in custom scripts or event handling code. It's
    important to ensure that the itemId provided actually exists in the game database
    and that the flags parameter is correctly set for proper item behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid items being added to the
    player's inventory, which may cause issues with game mechanics or character progression.
    Always verify that the itemId is valid before calling this method.
