  signature: void BattlePetManager::LoadPetDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the battle pet database into memory for use within
    the BattlePetManager.
  description: The LoadPetDatabase method is responsible for initializing and loading
    the battle pet database from the game's data sources into memory. This method
    ensures that all available battle pets are registered and accessible for player
    interaction, including their stats, abilities, and other properties. It typically
    executes during server startup or when the BattlePetManager is initialized, preparing
    the system to handle pet-related operations such as summoning, battling, and management.
    The method does not require any parameters and performs its operation internally
    using internal data structures and database connections managed by TrinityCore's
    core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlePetManager* petManager = sBattlePetMgr;

      petManager->LoadPetDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during server initialization
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for dynamic database
    reloading. It may involve significant I/O operations depending on the number of
    battle pets in the database.
  warnings: Invoking this method manually while pets are already in use can lead to
    undefined behavior or data corruption. The method is designed to be called once
    during initialization and should not be repeated unless necessary for hot-reloading.
