documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another SpellInterruptAction object to this object.
  description: The move assignment operator for SpellInterruptAction transfers ownership
    of resources from the source object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate SpellInterruptAction objects
    need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method ensures
    that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move
    operation, and it returns a reference to the current object for chaining operations.
    In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this operator may be used when managing
    spell interrupt actions during spell casting or aura application processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current SpellInterruptAction object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'SpellInterruptAction action1;

      SpellInterruptAction action2 = std::move(action1); // Uses move assignment

      // action1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<SpellInterruptAction> actions;

      actions.emplace_back();

      actions.back() = std::move(anotherAction); // Move assignment into container

      // anotherAction is left in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator follows the standard move semantics pattern. The source object
    should not be used after a move operation, as its state becomes undefined. Performance-wise,
    this operation typically has O(1) complexity and avoids expensive deep copying
    of internal data structures.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object must not
    be accessed or used in any way, as it will be left in an unspecified but valid
    state. Using the moved-from object can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
