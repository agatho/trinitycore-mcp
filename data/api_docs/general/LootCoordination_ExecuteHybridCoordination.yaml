  signature: void LootCoordination::ExecuteHybridCoordination(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Executes hybrid loot coordination logic for a group and item.
  description: The ExecuteHybridCoordination method handles the core logic for coordinating
    loot distribution within a group using a hybrid approach that combines both rolling
    and round-robin mechanisms. This method is typically invoked when a group member
    rolls for an item, and it determines whether to proceed with a standard loot roll
    or switch to a different coordination strategy based on group settings and item
    properties. It manages the internal state of the loot coordination system and
    ensures proper distribution according to the configured rules.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group involved
      in loot coordination. Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being coordinated for distribution. Must represent a valid loot item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      // ... populate item with loot data ...

      coordination.ExecuteHybridCoordination(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot coordination system and should not
    be called directly from external modules. It assumes that proper group membership
    checks have already been performed. The method modifies internal state variables
    related to loot distribution.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer or invalid item reference
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all preconditions are met
    before invoking this method.
