  brief: Initializes a quest turn-in process for a player
  description: The QuestTurnIn constructor initializes the necessary components to
    handle a quest completion event. This method sets up internal state tracking for
    the quest turn-in process, including validating the player's eligibility to turn
    in the quest and preparing required data structures. The method is typically invoked
    when a player interacts with a quest giver to complete a quest. It handles prerequisite
    checks such as quest completion status, item requirements, and player level validation
    before proceeding with the turn-in sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Initialization
    code: 'QuestTurnIn turnIn;

      turnIn.QuestTurnIn(); // Initializes the quest turn-in process'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    a player attempts to turn in a quest. Developers should not directly invoke this
    constructor unless implementing custom quest handling logic. The initialization
    includes setting up internal state variables and preparing for potential quest
    reward distribution.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of QuestTurnIn without proper context may lead to
    undefined behavior or incomplete quest completion. This constructor should only
    be used within the proper quest turn-in flow managed by TrinityCore's core systems.
