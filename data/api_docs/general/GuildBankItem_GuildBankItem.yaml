documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildBankItem object with default values.
  description: The GuildBankItem constructor initializes a new instance of the GuildBankItem
    class, setting up internal data structures and default property values for a guild
    bank item. This method is typically called when creating a new guild bank item
    entry in the database or when loading existing items from storage. The constructor
    ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their default states,
    including item GUID, slot positions, and stack counts. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, this constructor plays a crucial role in maintaining
    data integrity for items stored within guild bank tabs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuildBankItem instance
    code: 'GuildBankItem* item = new GuildBankItem();

      // The item is now initialized with default values

      item->SetItemID(12345);

      item->SetStackCount(10);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or load data from
    storage. It only initializes the object's internal state. When working with actual
    guild bank items, you typically need to call additional methods like LoadFromDB()
    or SetItemID() to populate the item with meaningful data.
