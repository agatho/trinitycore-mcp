documentation:
  brief: Updates all damage done modifiers for the unit, recalculating total damage
    bonuses and penalties.
  description: The UpdateAllDamageDoneMods method recalculates and applies all damage
    modification factors for the specified Unit. This includes buffs, debuffs, gear
    bonuses, and any other active modifiers that affect the amount of damage a unit
    can deal. The method ensures that the unit's total damage output reflects all
    current active effects in the game state. It is typically called when damage modifiers
    change, such as after applying or removing buffs, switching gear, or when combat
    state changes occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = ...;

      target->UpdateAllDamageDoneMods();'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Combat Context
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat())\n{\n    player->UpdateAllDamageDoneMods();\n\
      \    // Damage modifiers are now updated for combat calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive as it recalculates all damage modifiers.
    It should be called sparingly and only when necessary, such as after significant
    modifier changes. The method internally iterates through all active effects that
    modify damage done.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance degradation.
    Avoid calling it in tight loops or high-frequency update contexts unless absolutely
    necessary. Ensure the unit is valid before calling to prevent crashes.
