documentation:
  brief: Generates combo points for the feral druid character
  description: The GenerateComboPoints method is responsible for creating and assigning
    combo points to a feral druid player character. This method typically gets invoked
    when the druid performs abilities that generate combo points, such as Shred, Rake,
    or other combo point-generating attacks. The amount of combo points generated
    is determined by the input parameter 'amount'. This functionality is integral
    to the feral druid's gameplay mechanics, as combo points are required for executing
    finisher abilities like Ferocious Bite and Rip. The method updates the internal
    combo point counter within the druid's state and may trigger visual feedback or
    animations in the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of combo points to generate. Valid values are typically
      between 1 and 5, representing the standard combo point range in World of Warcraft.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combo Point Generation
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.GenerateComboPoints(1); // Generates 1 combo point'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Maximum Combo Points
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.GenerateComboPoints(5); // Generates maximum possible combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the druid's internal combo point tracking
    system and may update UI elements or send packets to the client. The implementation
    should ensure that combo points do not exceed the maximum allowed (5) and that
    the generation respects game rules such as cooldowns or resource limitations.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is validated to prevent invalid values
    from causing unexpected behavior. This method may be called in rapid succession
    during high-intensity combat, so performance considerations should be taken into
    account for frequent calls.
