  class: CreatureAI
  method: OnSpellClick
  signature: void CreatureAI::OnSpellClick(int * param0, bool param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature is clicked by a player casting a spell.
  description: The OnSpellClick method is invoked in CreatureAI when a player interacts
    with a creature using a spell that triggers a click interaction. This typically
    occurs during quest interactions or when a spell like 'Spirit Heal' or 'Resurrection'
    is cast on the creature. The method allows custom AI behavior to be defined for
    such events, enabling developers to implement specific responses or actions when
    a player clicks on the creature with certain spells. It serves as an extension
    point for adding custom logic without modifying core TrinityCore systems.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the spell ID of the spell used
      to click the creature.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the spell click was successful (true)
      or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void CustomCreatureAI::OnSpellClick(int* spellId, bool success)\n{\n  \
      \  if (success && *spellId == 12345)\n    {\n        // Perform custom action\
      \ when spell ID 12345 clicks the creature\n        DoCast(SPELL_CUSTOM_EFFECT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Interaction
    code: "void QuestGiverAI::OnSpellClick(int* spellId, bool success)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!success) return;\n    \n    switch (*spellId)\n    {\n        case SPELL_RESURRECTION:\n\
      \            // Handle resurrection request\n            if (HasQuest(QUEST_ID))\n\
      \                CompleteQuest(QUEST_ID);\n            break;\n        case\
      \ SPELL_SPIRIT_HEAL:\n            // Provide healing or quest progress\n   \
      \         DoCast(SPELL_HEALING_EFFECT);\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI interface and must be overridden in
    custom AI classes. The spell ID passed may vary depending on the specific spell
    used for interaction. Ensure that any actions taken within this method do not
    cause infinite loops or performance issues, especially if called frequently during
    gameplay.
  warnings: Do not modify the spellId parameter directly as it's a pointer to a value
    from the game engine. Be cautious with complex logic inside this function since
    it can be invoked rapidly during player interactions. Avoid calling methods that
    might block or delay execution for extended periods.
