  brief: Initializes a new HostileEventBus instance as a copy of an existing one
  description: The HostileEventBus constructor performs a deep copy of another HostileEventBus
    instance, establishing a new event bus that mirrors the state and configuration
    of the source. This method is typically used when creating duplicate event handling
    mechanisms for different contexts or scopes within the game's AI system. The copied
    instance maintains all registered event handlers and their associated callbacks
    from the original bus, ensuring consistent behavior across multiple subsystems.
    This constructor is essential for maintaining proper event propagation in TrinityCore's
    hostile creature AI systems where events need to be broadcasted to various interested
    parties.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an existing HostileEventBus instance
    code: 'HostileEventBus originalBus;

      // ... register event handlers ...

      HostileEventBus newBus(originalBus); // Creates a copy of the original bus'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the internal event handler list,
    meaning that while the structure is duplicated, any shared resources referenced
    by the handlers may still be shared between instances. Developers should ensure
    proper resource management when using copied event buses.
  warnings: Be cautious when copying HostileEventBus instances if they contain event
    handlers with non-thread-safe operations or shared mutable state, as modifications
    to one instance might affect the other.
