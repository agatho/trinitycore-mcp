  method: IsSitState
  signature: bool Unit::IsSitState() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the unit is in a sitting state.
  description: "This method determines if the unit is currently in a sit state, which\
    \ occurs when the unit's animation state is set to sitting. The function returns\
    \ true if the unit is sitting and false otherwise. This is commonly used in game\
    \ mechanics to check for player or NPC sitting states during various interactions\
    \ such as\u5750ting, resting, or performing actions that require a seated position."
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently sitting, false otherwise. The return
    value represents the current animation state of the unit where it is in a sitting
    pose.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsSitState()) {\n    // Unit is sitting\n    // Do something\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the unit's current animation state and may not reflect
    the actual physical position if the unit is in a different state. It should be
    used in conjunction with other methods that check for specific states.
  warnings: This method does not account for all possible sitting states; it only
    checks for the basic sitting state. Additional checks might be needed for more
    complex scenarios involving different types of sitting.
