  signature: void TerrainInfo::LoadMapAndVMapImpl(int32 gx, int32 gy)
documentation:
  brief: Loads map and VMap data for the specified grid coordinates.
  description: The LoadMapAndVMapImpl method is responsible for loading terrain and
    virtual map (VMap) data for a specific grid position within the World of Warcraft
    world. This method ensures that all necessary map tiles and their associated collision
    data are available for gameplay mechanics such as movement, line-of-sight calculations,
    and object placement. It typically operates on grid coordinates (gx, gy) which
    represent the X and Y positions of the map tile in the game's coordinate system.
    The method is part of the internal terrain management system and is usually invoked
    automatically when a player or object enters a new grid area.
  parameters:
  - name: gx
    description: The X grid coordinate representing the horizontal position of the
      map tile to load.
  - name: gy
    description: The Y grid coordinate representing the vertical position of the map
      tile to load.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading map data for a specific grid
    code: 'TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo();

      int32 gridX = 10;

      int32 gridY = 15;

      terrain->LoadMapAndVMapImpl(gridX, gridY);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when a player or
    object enters a new grid area. It may block until the data is loaded, depending
    on implementation details. The method assumes valid grid coordinates and does
    not perform bounds checking.
  warnings: Calling this method directly with invalid grid coordinates can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the grid coordinates are within valid
    map boundaries before invoking this method.
