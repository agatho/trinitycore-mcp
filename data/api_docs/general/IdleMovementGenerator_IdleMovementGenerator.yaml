documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the IdleMovementGenerator class.
  description: The IdleMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that is used to manage idle behavior for units in the game world. This generator
    typically handles situations where a unit has no active movement or pathfinding
    tasks and should remain stationary. It sets up internal state variables required
    for tracking idle status and ensures proper initialization of the movement generator's
    base functionality. The class is part of TrinityCore's AI system and is commonly
    used by creatures that are not currently engaged in combat, patrolling, or following
    a specific path.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an IdleMovementGenerator instance
    code: 'IdleMovementGenerator* idleGen = new IdleMovementGenerator();

      // The generator is now initialized and ready to be used by a unit''s AI system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic structure for an idle movement generator.
    The actual behavior of idle movement is determined by other methods in the class
    and how it's integrated into a unit's AI state machine.
