  signature: void SmartScript::ResetBaseObject()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the base object state in the SmartScript system to its initial condition.
  description: The ResetBaseObject method clears or reinitializes the internal state
    of a SmartScript instance, typically used when an AI script needs to be restarted
    or reset after execution. This method ensures that all previously set flags, counters,
    and state variables are cleared, allowing the script to begin execution from a
    clean slate. It is commonly invoked during AI behavior transitions, script reloads,
    or when an NPC's AI state must be fully reset without destroying the object itself.
    The operation does not affect the underlying GameObject or Creature data but resets
    only the SmartScript's internal tracking mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void OnReset() {\n    m_SmartScript->ResetBaseObject();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Script Restart
    code: "void RestartAI() {\n    m_SmartScript->ResetBaseObject();\n    m_SmartScript->StartScript();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the SmartScript system during
    state transitions. It should not be invoked manually unless explicitly required
    for custom AI logic or testing purposes.
  warnings: Calling ResetBaseObject while a script is actively running may lead to
    undefined behavior or inconsistent AI states. Ensure that this method is only
    used when the script is in a safe, inactive state.
