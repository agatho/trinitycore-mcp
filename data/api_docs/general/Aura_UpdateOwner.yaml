  class: Aura
  method: UpdateOwner
  signature: void Aura::UpdateOwner(uint32 diff, WorldObject * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the aura's owner object with new data.
  description: The UpdateOwner method updates the aura's owner object with new data,
    typically used during game tick processing to ensure the aura remains synchronized
    with its owner. This method is part of the core aura management system in TrinityCore
    and handles the synchronization of aura effects with their respective owners during
    gameplay. It performs updates on the aura's owner reference based on time passed
    and current state.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed since last update in milliseconds, used to determine
      how much time has passed for updating the aura
  - name: owner
    description: The WorldObject that owns this aura, typically a player or creature,
      which will be updated with new data
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Aura* aura = new Aura();

      WorldObject* owner = new Player();

      uint32 diff = 1000;

      aura->UpdateOwner(diff, owner);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Aura* aura = new Aura();

      WorldObject* owner = new Player();

      uint32 diff = 1000;

      aura->UpdateOwner(diff, owner);

      // This method is typically called during game tick processing

      // to ensure proper synchronization of aura effects with owner'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core aura management system and should be called
    during game tick processing. It ensures that the aura remains synchronized with
    its owner object, particularly in terms of time-based updates. Performance considerations
    include ensuring that this method is not called too frequently or unnecessarily.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method as it may cause issues if
    the owner object is deleted or becomes invalid during the update process. Also,
    improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect synchronization
    of aura effects.
