    * criteria) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the criteria data set associated with a given criteria object.
  description: The GetCriteriaDataSet method fetches the CriteriaDataSet that corresponds
    to the specified criteria. This method is typically used within the context of
    achievement tracking and criterion evaluation in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework. It allows access to detailed information about how a specific criterion
    is structured and what data it requires for evaluation. The returned pointer points
    to an immutable data set, ensuring thread safety when reading criterion configurations.
    This method does not modify any internal state and can be safely called from multiple
    threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the CriteriaDataSet associated with the given criteria.
    Returns nullptr if no matching criteria data set is found or if the input criteria
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const Criteria* criteria = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nconst CriteriaDataSet*\
      \ dataSet = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaDataSet(criteria);\nif (dataSet)\n{\n \
      \   // Use the data set for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation based on criteria ID. It is recommended
    to cache results if the same criteria are accessed frequently to avoid repeated
    lookups. The returned CriteriaDataSet should not be modified as it represents
    static configuration data.
  warnings: Ensure that the input criteria pointer is valid before calling this method,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. Do not attempt to modify the returned CriteriaDataSet
    as it is const and intended for read-only access.
