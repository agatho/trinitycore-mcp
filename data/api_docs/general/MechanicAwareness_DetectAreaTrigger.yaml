  method: DetectAreaTrigger
  signature: MechanicInfo MechanicAwareness::DetectAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger * trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and returns mechanic information for a specified area trigger.
  description: The DetectAreaTrigger method is used to analyze an AreaTrigger object
    and extract detailed mechanic information associated with it. This functionality
    is crucial in TrinityCore's AI and game logic systems, where understanding the
    effects and properties of area triggers (such as those used in spells, quests,
    or environmental interactions) is essential. The method processes the provided
    area trigger and returns a MechanicInfo structure that encapsulates relevant data
    about the trigger's mechanics, such as its type, duration, and potential impact
    on affected units. This allows for dynamic gameplay behaviors and responses based
    on the detected trigger properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MechanicInfo object containing detailed information about the
    area trigger's mechanics. The structure typically includes data such as the mechanic
    type, duration, and other relevant properties that define how the trigger affects
    game entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MechanicInfo info = awareness.DetectAreaTrigger(trigger);\nif (info.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the detected mechanic information\n    printf(\"Detected\
      \ mechanic type: %d\\n\", info.GetType());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI processing or spell effect handling
    in TrinityCore. It assumes that the provided AreaTrigger pointer is valid and
    properly initialized. The returned MechanicInfo object should be checked for validity
    before use to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the AreaTrigger parameter is not null before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in a crash. Also, be aware
    that the returned MechanicInfo may contain default or invalid values if the trigger
    does not have associated mechanic data.
