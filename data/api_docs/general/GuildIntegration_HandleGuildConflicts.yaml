  brief: Processes and resolves guild-related conflicts for a given player
  description: The HandleGuildConflicts method is responsible for identifying and
    resolving any active conflicts or disputes within a guild that may affect a specific
    player. This method typically checks for issues such as guild member disputes,
    conflicting guild permissions, or pending guild actions that require resolution.
    It operates on the provided player reference to determine the appropriate conflict
    resolution path. The method may trigger in-game notifications or updates to guild
    state based on conflict resolution outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system. This parameter is used to identify which player's
      guild conflicts should be processed and resolved.
  returns: null

    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.HandleGuildConflicts(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or when a guild event
    occurs that may trigger conflict resolution. It's important to ensure the player
    ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active guild member.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent player ID may result in undefined behavior
    or failed conflict resolution attempts. Ensure proper validation of the player
    reference before calling this method.
