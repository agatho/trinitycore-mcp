documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for paladin defensive abilities in PvP combat.
  description: The GetPaladinDefensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the
    remaining cooldown duration for a paladin's defensive abilities within PvP encounters.
    This method is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to determine when a paladin
    can next use defensive spells such as Divine Shield, Blessing of Protection, or
    other cooldown-based defensive measures. The returned value represents the time
    in milliseconds until the next available defensive ability usage. This functionality
    is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios where timing and resource management
    significantly impact combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cooldown time in milliseconds for paladin defensive
    abilities. Returns 0 if no cooldown is active or if the player is not a paladin.
    A negative value may indicate an error condition or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldown = ai->GetPaladinDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldown <= 0)\n{\n    // Paladins can use defensive abilities now\n   \
      \ player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_DIVINE_SHIELD, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Player Check
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nif (ai)\n{\n    int cooldown\
      \ = ai->GetPaladinDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n    if (cooldown > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Wait for cooldown to expire before using defensive ability\n   \
      \     uint32 waitTime = cooldown / 1000; // Convert to seconds\n        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Defensive ability on cooldown for %u seconds\", waitTime);\n    }\n    else\
      \ if (player->HasAura(SPELL_DIVINE_SHIELD))\n    {\n        // Defensive ability\
      \ is active, check if it needs refreshing\n        // Implementation logic here\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and may return inaccurate
    values if the player's combat state is not properly initialized. The returned
    cooldown value should be interpreted in the context of the current PvP encounter
    and player class specialization. Performance-wise, this method should be called
    sparingly during active combat to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: This method assumes the player object has a valid PvPCombatAI instance
    attached. Calling this on a non-paladin character may return unexpected results
    or cause undefined behavior. Always verify that the player is in a PvP context
    before relying on these cooldown values for gameplay decisions.
