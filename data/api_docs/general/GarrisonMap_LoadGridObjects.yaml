  class: GarrisonMap
  method: LoadGridObjects
  signature: void GarrisonMap::LoadGridObjects(int * grid, const int & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Loads game objects for a specified grid cell within the garrison map.
  description: The LoadGridObjects method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all game objects (such as buildings, units, or interactive elements) that exist
    within a specific grid cell of the garrison map. This method ensures that the
    objects are properly registered with the map's object manager and are ready to
    be interacted with by players or AI systems. It typically gets invoked when a
    player enters a new grid area or when the map is initialized for a particular
    garrison instance. The method operates on a grid-based system where each cell
    contains a set of objects that need to be loaded into memory for gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the grid coordinates (typically
      x, y) of the area to load. The array should contain at least two elements corresponding
      to grid X and Y values.
  - name: cell
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the specific cell within
      the grid that should be loaded. This parameter is used to determine which subset
      of objects in the grid needs to be initialized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for loading a single grid cell
    code: 'int grid[2] = {5, 10};

      int cell = 3;

      GarrisonMap* garrisonMap = ...; // Assume valid pointer

      // Load objects in grid (5, 10), cell 3

      garrisonMap->LoadGridObjects(grid, cell);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading multiple cells after player movement
    code: "void OnPlayerMove(GarrisonMap* map, int newX, int newY) {\n    int grid[2]\
      \ = {newX, newY};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {\n        // Load surrounding\
      \ cells\n        map->LoadGridObjects(grid, i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison system's internal object management and
    should only be called during appropriate initialization or transition phases.
    It assumes that the grid coordinates are valid and within the bounds of the garrison
    map. The method may trigger additional loading logic for dependent objects such
    as NPCs, buildings, or interactive items.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid grid coordinates can result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the grid array is properly initialized before
    passing it to the function. Also, avoid calling LoadGridObjects concurrently from
    multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
