    spell-related logic to distinguish between primary and secondary professions,
    which affects gameplay mechanics like skill progression and crafting requirements.

  notes: This method relies on internal spell data structure and may be affected by
    updates to the TrinityCore database. It should be used carefully when checking
    spell properties during gameplay.
  warnings: This method does not account for all possible spell types; it only checks
    for primary profession spells specifically, so care must be taken when using it
    in conjunction with other spell classification methods.
