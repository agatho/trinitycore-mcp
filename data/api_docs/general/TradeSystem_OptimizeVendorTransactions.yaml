  class: TradeSystem
  method: OptimizeVendorTransactions
  signature: void TradeSystem::OptimizeVendorTransactions(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes vendor transaction processing for a given player by cleaning up
    and reorganizing their trade data.
  description: The OptimizeVendorTransactions method is designed to improve performance
    and data consistency within the trading system for a specific player. It performs
    internal cleanup operations on the player's vendor-related trade data, such as
    removing outdated or redundant transaction entries, consolidating similar transactions,
    and ensuring proper state management. This method is typically invoked during
    periodic maintenance or when significant changes occur in a player's trading activity
    to prevent performance degradation and data bloat. The optimization process ensures
    that subsequent vendor interactions are more efficient and that the trade system
    maintains accurate records without unnecessary overhead.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      TradeSystem::OptimizeVendorTransactions(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it performs intensive data processing
    operations. It may temporarily lock trade-related data structures, so calling
    it during high-traffic periods could impact performance. The optimization process
    is non-destructive and preserves all valid transaction history.
  warnings: Do not call this method in high-frequency loops or during active trading
    sessions without considering the potential for temporary performance degradation.
    Ensure that player data is properly synchronized before invoking this function
    to avoid inconsistencies.
