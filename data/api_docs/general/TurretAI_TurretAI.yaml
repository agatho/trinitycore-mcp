  class: TurretAI
  method: TurretAI
  signature: void TurretAI::TurretAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a turret AI instance for the specified creature with the given
    script ID.
  description: The TurretAI constructor initializes a turret AI behavior for a Creature
    object. This method sets up the necessary internal state and configuration for
    the turret to function within the TrinityCore framework. It typically configures
    the AI to follow specific turret behaviors such as targeting enemies, firing projectiles,
    or maintaining a fixed orientation. The scriptId parameter allows for different
    turret behaviors or configurations to be applied based on the script assigned
    to the creature. This constructor is usually called during the creation of turret
    creatures in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will be controlled by this AI
      instance. Must not be null and should represent a valid turret creature in the
      game world.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier used to determine the specific behavior or script
      configuration for this turret AI. This ID maps to predefined turret behaviors
      within the TrinityCore scripting system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TurretAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* turret = ...; // Get reference to turret creature

      int scriptId = 12345;

      TurretAI* ai = new TurretAI(turret, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: TurretAI with Dynamic Script ID
    code: 'Creature* turret = ...; // Get reference to turret creature

      int scriptId = turret->GetEntry(); // Use creature entry as script ID

      turret->SetAI(new TurretAI(turret, scriptId));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a creature's lifecycle. The AI instance will automatically manage the turret's
    behavior based on the provided script ID. Ensure that the creature parameter is
    valid and represents a proper turret type before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same creature without
    properly cleaning up previous AI instances to avoid memory leaks or undefined
    behavior. The scriptId should correspond to an existing turret script in the database,
    otherwise unexpected behavior may occur.
