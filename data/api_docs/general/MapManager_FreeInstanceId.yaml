  class: MapManager
  method: FreeInstanceId
  signature: void MapManager::FreeInstanceId(uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Frees a previously allocated instance ID for reuse in the MapManager's instance
    ID pool.
  description: The FreeInstanceId method releases a specific instance ID back into
    the available pool of IDs within the MapManager. This allows the system to reuse
    instance IDs that are no longer in use, preventing ID exhaustion and ensuring
    efficient memory management. The method is typically called when an instance is
    destroyed or becomes inactive, allowing its associated ID to be reassigned to
    new instances. It is important to ensure that all references to the freed instance
    ID are properly cleaned up before calling this method to avoid dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Freeing an Instance ID After Instance Destruction
    code: "void OnInstanceDestroy(uint32 instanceId)\n{\n    // Clean up any remaining\
      \ data for the instance\n    CleanupInstanceData(instanceId);\n    \n    //\
      \ Free the instance ID back to the pool\n    sMapMgr->FreeInstanceId(instanceId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with valid, previously allocated instance
    IDs. Calling it with an invalid or already-freed ID may lead to undefined behavior.
    The MapManager maintains internal tracking of used and free instance IDs, so calling
    this method is essential for proper resource management.
  warnings: Never call FreeInstanceId on an instance ID that is still actively being
    used by any active instance or related systems. Doing so can cause crashes or
    data corruption when the system attempts to access freed resources.
