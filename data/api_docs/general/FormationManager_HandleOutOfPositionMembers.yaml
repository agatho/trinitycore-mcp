  signature: void FormationManager::HandleOutOfPositionMembers()
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles members of a formation that are out of their designated
    positions.
  description: The HandleOutOfPositionMembers method is responsible for identifying
    and managing units within a formation that have moved outside of their expected
    positional boundaries. This method typically iterates through all members of the
    formation, evaluates their current location against their assigned formation position,
    and performs corrective actions such as repositioning or resetting their movement
    behavior. It plays a crucial role in maintaining proper group positioning during
    combat or movement scenarios, ensuring that units remain in their designated roles
    within the formation. The method is often invoked automatically by the AI system
    or triggered manually during specific tactical situations.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_formationManager)\n        m_formationManager->HandleOutOfPositionMembers();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may have performance
    implications when dealing with large formations. It assumes that formation data
    has already been initialized and that units are properly registered within the
    formation. The method does not directly modify unit positions but rather triggers
    appropriate movement behaviors or resets.
  warnings: Invoking this method inappropriately (e.g., during critical combat sequences)
    may cause unexpected movement behavior. Ensure that the formation manager and
    its members are properly initialized before calling this method, as it may crash
    if units are not correctly registered.
