documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotPerformanceMonitor class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the performance monitoring utility exists
    throughout the application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access
    global performance tracking functionality for AI bots within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned reference provides access to all performance monitoring capabilities
    including bot execution time measurement, resource usage tracking, and performance
    statistics collection.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BotPerformanceMonitor instance. This reference
    can be used to call other methods on the monitor for collecting or managing performance
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Monitor
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor& monitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance();

      monitor.StartTracking("bot_name");

      // ... bot logic ...

      monitor.StopTracking("bot_name");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieving Performance Statistics
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor& monitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance();\nstd::map<std::string,\
      \ uint32> stats = monitor.GetPerformanceStats();\nfor (const auto& entry : stats)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Bot \" << entry.first << \" took \" << entry.second\
      \ << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it uses a static local variable approach for
    singleton creation. The instance is created on first access and persists for the
    lifetime of the application. This pattern ensures lazy initialization and prevents
    race conditions during construction.
  warnings: The singleton instance should not be manually deleted or destroyed, as
    this will lead to undefined behavior. All access to performance monitoring functionality
    should go through this Instance() method to maintain consistency and proper resource
    management.
