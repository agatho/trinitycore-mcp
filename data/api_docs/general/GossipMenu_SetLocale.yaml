documentation:
  brief: Sets the locale for the gossip menu to determine localized text display.
  description: The SetLocale method configures the locale constant for a GossipMenu
    instance, which controls how localized text is displayed to players. This method
    ensures that when a player interacts with the gossip menu, the appropriate language-specific
    strings are shown based on their client's locale settings. The locale parameter
    should be one of the predefined LocaleConstant values that correspond to supported
    game languages. This method typically gets called during the initialization or
    setup phase of a gossip menu before it is presented to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Gossip Menu Locale to English
    code: 'GossipMenu menu;

      menu.SetLocale(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      // The gossip menu will now display text in English'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Gossip Menu Locale Based on Player Language
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is available

      GossipMenu menu;

      menu.SetLocale(player->GetSession()->GetSessionDbLocaleIndex());

      // Sets the locale based on the player''s session language setting'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the display of localized strings within the gossip
    menu. It does not change any underlying data or behavior, but rather controls
    text presentation. The locale must be a valid LocaleConstant value; otherwise,
    the default locale may be used.
  warnings: Ensure that the specified locale is supported by the game client to avoid
    displaying untranslated or fallback text. Using an invalid locale constant might
    result in undefined behavior or default locale fallbacks.
