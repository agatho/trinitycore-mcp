  class: QuestCompletion
  method: UpdateQuestProgress
  signature: void QuestCompletion::UpdateQuestProgress(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest progress for a player character within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The UpdateQuestProgress method is responsible for refreshing and synchronizing
    the current state of quest progress for a specified player. This function typically
    handles the logic required to ensure that quest objectives, rewards, and completion
    status are accurately reflected in the player's active quest log. It may also
    trigger related quest events or notifications to maintain consistency between
    the client and server states. The method operates on a single Player object and
    modifies internal quest tracking data without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose quest progress needs to be updated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent an active player in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.UpdateQuestProgress(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal quest system of TrinityCore,
    updating both local and database states. It may be called automatically by the
    core when certain conditions are met or manually during custom AI logic implementation.
