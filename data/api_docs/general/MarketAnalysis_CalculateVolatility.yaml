  brief: Calculates the volatility of market prices for an item
  description: The CalculateVolatility method computes a volatility metric based on
    historical price data for items in the game's auction house system. This metric
    represents how much the price of an item fluctuates over time, which is essential
    for balancing the economy and providing players with insights into market stability.
    The method analyzes price variations to determine the degree of uncertainty or
    risk associated with an item's value. It typically uses statistical measures such
    as standard deviation or variance to quantify these fluctuations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated volatility of item prices.
    Higher values indicate greater price instability, while lower values suggest more
    stable pricing. The exact scale and interpretation may depend on the internal
    implementation but generally ranges from 0.0 (completely stable) to higher positive
    values indicating increasing volatility.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Volatility Calculation
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      float volatility = analyzer.CalculateVolatility();

      printf("Market volatility: %.2f\n", volatility);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires sufficient historical price data to produce meaningful
    results. It may cache previous calculations for performance optimization. The
    calculation might be affected by time periods, sample sizes, or specific market
    conditions.
  warnings: The method signature appears to have an incorrect parameter type (const
    int & prices) which should likely be a container of prices or a reference to a
    data structure containing price history rather than a single integer. This could
    lead to runtime errors if not properly handled.
