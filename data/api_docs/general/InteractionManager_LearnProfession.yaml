  class: InteractionManager

  signature: bool InteractionManager::LearnProfession(Player * bot, Creature * trainer,
    uint32 skillId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a player a profession skill from a trainer creature.
  description: The LearnProfession method facilitates the process of a bot learning
    a new profession skill from a trainer NPC. It validates that the specified skill
    is a valid profession, checks if the player has sufficient skill points or requirements
    to learn it, and handles the necessary game state updates including skill level
    progression and quest completion if applicable. This method interacts with the
    TrinityCore's core skill and quest systems to ensure proper learning mechanics
    are followed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to learn
      the profession.
  - name: trainer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC trainer offering
      the profession skill.
  - name: skillId
    description: The unique identifier for the skill to be learned, typically corresponding
      to a profession such as Engineering (skill ID 433), Leatherworking (skill ID
      165), etc.
  returns: Returns true if the profession was successfully learned by the player;
    otherwise returns false if the learning process failed due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient requirements, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LearnProfession
    code: "if (interactionManager->LearnProfession(bot, trainer, 433)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ learned Engineering\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"You have learned\
      \ Engineering!\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to learn profession\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to learn profession.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and trainer are within interaction range,
    and that the trainer actually offers the specified skill. The implementation may
    also depend on the bot's current skill levels and available skill points.
  warnings: Ensure that the skillId corresponds to a valid profession before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid or non-profession skill ID will likely result
    in failure without proper error handling.
