  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 CombatStateAnalyzer::GetUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the last update time of the combat state analyzer in milliseconds.
  description: The GetUpdateTime method retrieves the timestamp of the last update
    performed by the CombatStateAnalyzer. This value represents the number of milliseconds
    since the system started, which is commonly used for tracking time-based events
    and determining when combat states were last modified. The returned value can
    be used to calculate elapsed time between updates or to synchronize combat-related
    logic with the game's internal timing system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds since the system
    started when the combat state was last updated. This timestamp is typically used
    for time-based comparisons and synchronization within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Last Update Time
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      uint32 lastUpdate = analyzer.GetUpdateTime();

      printf("Last combat state update was at %u ms\n", lastUpdate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Update Time for Combat State Monitoring
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nuint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\nuint32\
      \ lastUpdate = analyzer.GetUpdateTime();\nif (currentTime - lastUpdate > 5000)\
      \ {\n    // Combat state hasn't been updated in 5 seconds\n    printf(\"Combat\
      \ state may be stale\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat state tracking
    mechanisms. The returned timestamp should be compared against current system time
    using appropriate time difference calculations to determine if the combat state
    has become outdated.
