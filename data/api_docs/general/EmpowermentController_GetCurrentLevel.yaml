  method: GetCurrentLevel
  signature: EmpowermentLevel EmpowermentController::GetCurrentLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current empowerment level of the controller.
  description: The GetCurrentLevel method returns the EmpowermentLevel enum value
    representing the current state or degree of empowerment for the EmpowermentController
    instance. This method is typically used in game mechanics where entities can have
    varying levels of empowered states, such as buffed stats, enhanced abilities,
    or special conditions. The returned value indicates what level of empowerment
    is currently active and may influence behavior, calculations, or visual effects
    within the game system. This method does not modify any internal state and is
    purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An EmpowermentLevel enum value indicating the current empowerment state
    of the controller. Possible values depend on the specific implementation but generally
    represent discrete levels such as NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or MAX.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "EmpowermentLevel level = controller->GetCurrentLevel();\nif (level == EmpowermentLevel::HIGH)\n\
      {\n    // Apply high empowerment effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Level for Conditional Logic
    code: "auto level = controller->GetCurrentLevel();\nswitch (level)\n{\n    case\
      \ EmpowermentLevel::NONE:\n        // No empowerment active\n        break;\n\
      \    case EmpowermentLevel::LOW:\n        // Apply low empowerment bonuses\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other levels\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and thread-safe, assuming the underlying EmpowermentController
    state is properly synchronized. It should be used efficiently as it's likely called
    frequently in performance-critical code paths such as game loop updates or ability
    checks.
