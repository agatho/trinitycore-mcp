documentation:
  brief: Sets the taxi benchmark mode for the player's current session.
  description: The HandleSetTaxiBenchmark method processes a client packet to enable
    or disable the taxi benchmark mode in World of Warcraft. This feature allows players
    to test and optimize their taxi route paths by recording and analyzing travel
    times between flight points. The method updates the session state to reflect whether
    benchmarking is active, which affects how taxi-related data is logged and processed
    for performance analysis.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      WorldPackets::Misc::SetTaxiBenchmark packet;

      packet.Mode = true; // Enable benchmark mode

      session->HandleSetTaxiBenchmark(packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the WorldSession's internal state related to
    taxi path optimization. It is typically invoked when a player interacts with the
    taxi benchmark UI element in the game client.
