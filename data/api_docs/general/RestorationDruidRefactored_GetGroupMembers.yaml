documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of members in the player's group
  description: The GetGroupMembers method returns an integer representing the total
    count of players currently in the same group as the RestorationDruidRefactored
    instance. This includes the player themselves and any other group members, whether
    they are in the same map or not. The method is commonly used by Druid AI logic
    to determine group composition for spell targeting, healing priorities, or buff
    distribution. It performs a check to ensure the player is actually in a group
    before counting members, returning 0 if no group exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of group members, including the
    player. Returns 0 if the player is not in a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Size
    code: "int memberCount = druid.GetGroupMembers();\nif (memberCount > 1)\n{\n \
      \   // Perform group-based healing or buffing logic\n    DoGroupHealing();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Group Size for Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "int members = druid.GetGroupMembers();\nif (members >= 5)\n{\n    // Cast\
      \ a group-wide heal\n    druid.CastSpell(SPELL_GROUP_HEAL);\n}\nelse if (members\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast a smaller area heal\n    druid.CastSpell(SPELL_AREA_HEAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore group management system
    and will accurately reflect changes in group membership such as players leaving
    or joining. It does not account for players who are in different zones or instances,
    only those in the same logical group.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic depending on this value handles the case where the
    return value is 0 (no group). Also note that this method may return unexpected
    results if called during group creation/destruction phases.
