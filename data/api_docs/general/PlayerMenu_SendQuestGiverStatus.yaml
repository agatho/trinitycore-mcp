  class: PlayerMenu
  method: SendQuestGiverStatus
  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendQuestGiverStatus(QuestGiverStatus questStatus, int
    npcGUID) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends the quest giver status to the player's client for a specified NPC.
  description: The SendQuestGiverStatus method is used to communicate the current
    quest status of an NPC to the player's client. This status determines what quest-related
    options are displayed in the quest window, such as whether the player can accept,
    turn in, or has completed a quest. The method takes a QuestGiverStatus enum value
    and an NPC GUID to identify which NPC's status should be updated. This is typically
    called when a player interacts with an NPC to open the quest menu, ensuring that
    the client displays the correct UI elements based on the player's quest progress
    and the NPC's available quests.
  parameters:
  - name: questStatus
    description: The QuestGiverStatus enum value indicating the current status of
      the quest giver. Valid values include QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_NONE, QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE,
      QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_AVAILABLE, QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_REWARD_REP, etc., which control
      what options are shown in the client's quest window.
  - name: npcGUID
    description: The integer GUID of the NPC whose quest status is being sent. This
      identifies the specific NPC object in the game world for which the quest status
      should be updated on the player's client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when a player interacts with an NPC
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      playerMenu->SendQuestGiverStatus(QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_AVAILABLE, npc->GetGUID().GetCounter());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending quest status based on player's quest progress
    code: "if (player->HasQuestForGO(npc->GetEntry()))\n{\n    playerMenu->SendQuestGiverStatus(QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_REWARD_REP,\
      \ npc->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}\nelse\n{\n    playerMenu->SendQuestGiverStatus(QUEST_GIVER_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE,\
      \ npc->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly sends a packet to the client and should only be called
    when the quest status is actually changing. It does not perform any validation
    on the questStatus parameter; invalid values may cause unexpected behavior in
    the client UI. The NPC GUID must correspond to an actual NPC object in the world
    for the update to take effect.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or with invalid NPC GUIDs can
    result in incorrect UI states or client-side errors. Ensure that questStatus is
    a valid enum value from the QuestGiverStatus enumeration. This method should not
    be called during network packet processing as it may cause recursion issues.
