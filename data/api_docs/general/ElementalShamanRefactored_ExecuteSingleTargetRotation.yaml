  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void ElementalShamanRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the elemental shaman's single-target combat rotation logic.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core combat behavior
    for an elemental shaman AI when targeting a single enemy. This method evaluates
    the current combat state, manages spell casting priorities, and applies elemental
    spell rotation strategies based on game mechanics such as mana management, cooldowns,
    and damage output optimization. It typically integrates with the broader AI framework
    to determine which spells to cast next in sequence for maximum effectiveness against
    a single target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the combat system. This parameter is used to access and manipulate the
      target object for spell targeting and damage calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: 'ElementalShamanRefactored shaman;

      int targetId = 42;

      shaman.ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Management System
    code: "void CombatManager::UpdateElementalShaman()\n{\n    ElementalShamanRefactored\
      \ shaman;\n    if (currentTarget != nullptr)\n    {\n        int targetIndex\
      \ = currentTarget->GetGUID();\n        shaman.ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetIndex);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ElementalShamanRefactored class has been properly
    initialized with valid spell data and combat state. The target parameter must
    point to a valid target object within the game world for proper execution. Performance
    considerations include minimizing redundant checks during rotation evaluation.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the target pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target exists and is valid before calling this method.
    This method does not perform any safety checks on the target's validity internally.
