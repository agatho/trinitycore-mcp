  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::HandleDefensiveCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the application and management of defensive cooldowns for a destruction
    warlock.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method manages the activation, tracking,
    and execution of defensive abilities that are on cooldown for a destruction warlock
    class. This includes checking if defensive spells such as Dark Regeneration or
    Soulstone are available, handling their cooldown states, and ensuring proper timing
    and usage within the combat rotation. The method integrates with the core TrinityCore
    AI system to maintain optimal defensive spell usage while respecting game balance
    and cooldown mechanics. It is typically invoked during combat updates or specific
    trigger events to ensure defensive cooldowns are properly managed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void DestructionWarlockRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n        // Other combat logic\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making process and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. It relies on internal cooldown tracking and spell
    availability checks, so it must be invoked after all relevant state changes have
    been processed.
  warnings: Improper invocation timing may lead to defensive spells being used incorrectly
    or at suboptimal times. Ensure that this method is only called when the warlock
    is in combat and has valid targets.
