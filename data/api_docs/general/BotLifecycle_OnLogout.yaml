documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state management when a bot player logs out of the game
  description: The OnLogout method is invoked when a bot player exits the game session,
    performing necessary cleanup operations such as releasing resources, saving bot
    state, and updating internal tracking structures. This method ensures that bot
    behavior is properly terminated and that any associated data is correctly persisted
    or discarded. It typically runs during the logout sequence to maintain game integrity
    and prevent memory leaks or inconsistent states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in logout handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->IsBot())\n\
      \    {\n        BotLifecycle::OnLogout();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore framework during player
    logout events. Developers should not invoke this method directly unless implementing
    custom logout logic. The implementation assumes that all necessary state has been
    prepared for cleanup before execution.
