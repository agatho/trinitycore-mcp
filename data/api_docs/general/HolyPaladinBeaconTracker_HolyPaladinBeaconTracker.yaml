documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the HolyPaladinBeaconTracker class for tracking
    beacon effects.
  description: The HolyPaladinBeaconTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the tracker used to monitor and manage the beacon effect applied by Holy Paladins.
    This tracker is responsible for maintaining information about which targets are
    currently under the influence of a beacon, ensuring proper application and removal
    of the beacon's healing bonuses. The class likely handles internal state tracking
    for beacon targets, cooldowns, and interaction with the Paladin's healing mechanics.
    It is typically instantiated when a Holy Paladin casts the Beacon of Light spell
    or when the system needs to begin tracking beacon effects on party/raid members.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of beacon tracker
    code: 'HolyPaladinBeaconTracker* beaconTracker = new HolyPaladinBeaconTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track beacon effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or data loading.
    It simply sets up the basic tracking structure for beacon effects. The actual
    beacon tracking logic likely occurs through other methods in the class rather
    than during construction.
