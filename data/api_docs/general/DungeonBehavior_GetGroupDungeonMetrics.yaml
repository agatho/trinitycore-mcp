  method: GetGroupDungeonMetrics
  signature: DungeonMetrics DungeonBehavior::GetGroupDungeonMetrics(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves dungeon metrics for a specified group within the dungeon behavior
    system.
  description: The GetGroupDungeonMetrics method fetches performance and completion
    statistics for a specific group participating in a dungeon. This function is typically
    used by the dungeon management system to track group progress, completion times,
    and other relevant metrics during dungeon encounters. The returned DungeonMetrics
    object contains data such as elapsed time, number of players, difficulty settings,
    and completion status. This method assumes that the group has been properly initialized
    within the dungeon behavior context and that the dungeon instance is active.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DungeonMetrics object containing detailed statistics about the group's
    dungeon performance including completion time, player count, difficulty level,
    and success status. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure if no metrics
    are available for the specified group.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Group Dungeon Metrics
    code: "DungeonMetrics metrics = dungeonBehavior->GetGroupDungeonMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (metrics.IsValid())\n{\n    std::cout << \"Group completed dungeon in \"\
      \ << metrics.GetElapsedTime() << \" seconds.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group is actively participating
    in a dungeon instance. The DungeonMetrics object returned may contain default
    values if the group has not yet completed any significant actions within the dungeon.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive group ID will likely
    return an invalid metrics structure. Ensure that the group exists and is properly
    registered with the dungeon behavior system before calling this method.
