documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SpatialHostileCache instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpatialHostileCache class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to maintain
    the cache of hostile units within a specific spatial area. This method ensures
    proper resource deallocation when the cache object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this cache is typically
    used by AI systems to quickly access nearby hostile targets for decision-making
    processes such as threat assessment and target selection. The destructor does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of SpatialHostileCache
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      // ... populate cache with hostile units ...

      // When cache goes out of scope, destructor is automatically called

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when the
    object's scope ends. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process may involve
    iterating through cached entries to properly release references or clear internal
    data structures.
