  signature: uint64 Guild::GetMemberAvailableMoneyForRepairItems(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the available money a guild member can use for repairing items.
  description: This method retrieves the amount of gold that a specific guild member
    has available for repairing items. It considers the member's current inventory
    and bank contents, excluding any items that are currently being used or equipped.
    This value is typically used in conjunction with the guild's repair system to
    determine how much a player can contribute towards repairing guild-owned items.
    The method performs a calculation based on the player's total gold, subtracting
    any amounts already allocated for repairs or other guild-related transactions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild member whose available
      repair money is being queried.
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total amount of gold that the specified
    guild member can use for repairing items. Returns 0 if the member does not exist
    or has no available funds.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Available Repair Money for a Guild Member
    code: "uint64 availableMoney = guild->GetMemberAvailableMoneyForRepairItems(playerGuid);\n\
      if (availableMoney > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with repair transaction\n    // ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Player Can Afford Repair Before Proceeding
    code: "uint64 playerMoney = guild->GetMemberAvailableMoneyForRepairItems(playerGuid);\n\
      uint64 repairCost = 10000; // Example cost\nif (playerMoney >= repairCost)\n\
      {\n    // Allow the repair to proceed\n    // ...\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Inform\
      \ player they don't have enough funds\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations involving the player's inventory and
    bank, which could impact performance if called frequently. It is recommended to
    cache this value when possible rather than calling it repeatedly during a single
    transaction.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual guild member; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined. This method should not be used directly for modifying
    player gold amounts without proper validation and transaction handling.
