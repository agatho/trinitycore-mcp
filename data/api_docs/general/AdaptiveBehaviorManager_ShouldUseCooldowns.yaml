  method: ShouldUseCooldowns
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseCooldowns() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager should utilize cooldowns
    for ability usage.
  description: The ShouldUseCooldowns method evaluates the current state and context
    of an AI-controlled unit to decide if cooldown mechanics should be applied when
    selecting abilities. This method is typically used in adaptive AI systems where
    the decision-making process considers factors such as combat phase, resource availability,
    or strategic objectives. The result influences whether abilities are delayed based
    on their cooldown timers, affecting overall tactical behavior and performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if cooldowns should be considered during ability selection;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseCooldowns()) {\n    // Apply cooldown\
      \ logic for ability usage\n    unit->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Use abilities immediately without cooldown checks\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger adaptive AI system that dynamically
    adjusts behavior based on game state. It may be called frequently during combat
    updates and should ideally be lightweight to avoid performance impact.
