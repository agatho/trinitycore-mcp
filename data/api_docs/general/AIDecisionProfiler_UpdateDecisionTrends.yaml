documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI decision trends by analyzing recent decision patterns and
    storing statistical data for performance monitoring.
  description: The UpdateDecisionTrends method is responsible for collecting and processing
    recent AI decision data within the TrinityCore framework. It analyzes the frequency,
    outcomes, and timing of AI decisions made by NPCs to build trend statistics. These
    trends are typically used for debugging, performance optimization, and understanding
    AI behavior in various game scenarios. The method likely aggregates data from
    multiple sources including decision logs, execution times, and outcome tracking
    to generate meaningful statistical insights about AI decision-making patterns.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_aiDecisionProfiler.UpdateDecisionTrends();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI execution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during AI update cycles to maintain
    up-to-date trend statistics. It may have performance implications if called too
    frequently without batching updates, and should be considered when optimizing
    AI-heavy areas of the game world.
