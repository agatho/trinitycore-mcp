documentation:
  brief: Respawns a game object, making it available for interaction again after being
    destroyed.
  description: The Respawn method restores a GameObject to its active state, allowing
    players to interact with it again after it has been destroyed. This method is
    typically used when a GameObject needs to be reset or reactivated, such as during
    quest completion or when a game object's respawn timer expires. The method updates
    the GameObject's state and makes it visible to players in the world. It does not
    reset the GameObject's health or other attributes, which must be handled separately.
