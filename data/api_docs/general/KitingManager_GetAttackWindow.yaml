  class: KitingManager
  method: GetAttackWindow
  signature: float KitingManager::GetAttackWindow(KitingType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the attack window duration for a specified kiting
    type.
  description: The GetAttackWindow method retrieves the time window during which an
    attacker can successfully land a melee or ranged attack against a target, based
    on the kiting type provided. This value is crucial for determining combat timing
    and accuracy in World of Warcraft's mechanics. The method accounts for various
    factors such as player speed, weapon speed, and target movement to compute a precise
    attack window. It is typically used by AI systems and combat logic to determine
    optimal attack timing and to ensure realistic combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the attack window duration in seconds.
    This value indicates how long an attacker has to land a successful hit after initiating
    an attack, based on the specified kiting type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float window = kitingManager.GetAttackWindow(KitingType::Normal);

      // Returns the attack window for normal kiting behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Kiting Types
    code: 'float fastWindow = kitingManager.GetAttackWindow(KitingType::Fast);

      float slowWindow = kitingManager.GetAttackWindow(KitingType::Slow);

      // Compare attack windows for different kiting behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal calculations based on player attributes,
    weapon statistics, and combat mechanics. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific kiting type (e.g., fast, slow, normal) and could be influenced
    by game updates or patches.
