  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const SpellDetectionConfig & InterruptAwareness::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell detection configuration used for interrupt awareness.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a constant reference to the SpellDetectionConfig
    object that defines how spell interrupts and awareness are handled within the
    InterruptAwareness system. This configuration includes parameters such as detection
    range, interrupt thresholds, and awareness flags that govern when and how spells
    can be interrupted or detected by players or NPCs. The returned configuration
    is read-only and should not be modified directly, as changes would affect all
    components using this shared configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the SpellDetectionConfig object containing the
    current spell detection settings for interrupt awareness.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Spell Detection Configuration
    code: 'const SpellDetectionConfig& config = interruptAwareness.GetConfig();

      float detectionRange = config.detectionRange;

      bool canInterrupt = config.canInterruptSpells;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to a shared configuration object. Modifications
    to this configuration should be done through dedicated setter methods or configuration
    management systems rather than direct member access to avoid unintended side effects
    across the system.
