    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the strategy for accepting a quest based on the bot's GUID
  description: The GetQuestAcceptanceStrategy method evaluates the quest acceptance
    behavior for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically used
    in automated questing systems to determine how a bot should respond when presented
    with a quest offer. It considers various factors such as quest requirements, bot
    class, level, and available quest data to return an appropriate strategy. The
    returned strategy guides the bot's decision-making process for accepting or declining
    quests.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player for which to determine
      the quest acceptance strategy
  returns: Returns a QuestAcceptanceStrategy enum value that indicates how the bot
    should handle quest acceptance. Possible values may include ACCEPT_QUEST, DECLINE_QUEST,
    or DEFER_QUEST depending on the evaluation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine quest acceptance strategy
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nQuestAcceptanceStrategy strategy = questPickup->GetQuestAcceptanceStrategy(botGuid);\n\
      if (strategy == QuestAcceptanceStrategy::ACCEPT_QUEST)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ quest acceptance logic\n    printf(\"Bot should accept the quest\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using strategy to make automated quest decisions
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nQuestAcceptanceStrategy\
      \ strategy = questPickup->GetQuestAcceptanceStrategy(botGuid);\nswitch (strategy)\n\
      {\n    case QuestAcceptanceStrategy::ACCEPT_QUEST:\n        // Accept the quest\n\
      \        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(quest, player,\
      \ true);\n        break;\n    case QuestAcceptanceStrategy::DECLINE_QUEST:\n\
      \        // Decline the quest\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(quest,\
      \ player, false);\n        break;\n    case QuestAcceptanceStrategy::DEFER_QUEST:\n\
      \        // Defer decision for later\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex logic that evaluates quest prerequisites,
    bot capabilities, and quest data. It may cache results or perform database lookups
    to determine the appropriate strategy. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot player. Invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or exceptions. This method
    might not be suitable for real-time performance-critical applications due to potential
    database queries or complex evaluation logic.
