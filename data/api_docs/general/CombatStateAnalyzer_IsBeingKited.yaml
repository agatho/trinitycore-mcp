documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently being kited by an enemy target.
  description: The IsBeingKited method evaluates the combat state of a unit to determine
    if it is currently being kited. Kiting is a gameplay mechanic where an enemy unit
    maintains distance while attacking, typically by moving away from the player's
    attack range. This method analyzes various factors such as movement patterns,
    attack timing, and target positioning to detect kiting behavior. The result is
    used by AI systems to adjust combat strategies and decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is being kited by an enemy target, indicating
    that the target is maintaining distance while attacking. Returns false if the
    unit is not being kited or if the combat state cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (analyzer.IsBeingKited()) {\n    // Switch to ranged attack mode\n \
      \   unit->SetCombatStyle(COMBAT_STYLE_RANGED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining with other combat state checks
    code: "if (analyzer.IsBeingKited() && !analyzer.IsInMeleeRange()) {\n    // Adjust\
      \ behavior for kiting scenario\n    unit->GetAI()->DoFlee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on recent combat data and movement tracking. It may return
    false positives or negatives if the unit's movement is erratic or if combat state
    information is not fully updated. The implementation considers factors like attack
    frequency, distance changes, and target positioning over a short time window.
  warnings: The method should not be used as the sole indicator for combat decisions
    due to potential false readings during rapid movement or when targets are in complex
    terrain. Always combine with other combat state checks for more reliable behavior
    prediction.
