api:
  class: Guild
  method: SendLoginInfo
  signature: void Guild::SendLoginInfo(WorldSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Sends guild login information to the specified session.
  description: The SendLoginInfo method is responsible for transmitting guild-related
    login data to a connected WorldSession. This typically includes guild name, guild
    leader information, and other relevant guild details that are required for the
    client to properly display the guild's presence in the game world. The method
    is usually invoked during a player's login process when their session is established,
    ensuring that the client has up-to-date guild information. It handles serialization
    of guild data and sends it through the network to the specific session provided.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      to which the guild login information will be sent. This parameter must not be
      null and should correspond to an active player session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Login Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGuild())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetGuild()->SendLoginInfo(player->GetSession());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core during session initialization
    or when a player joins a guild. It's important to ensure that the session passed
    is valid and active before calling this method, as sending data to an invalid
    session may cause client-side issues or network errors.
