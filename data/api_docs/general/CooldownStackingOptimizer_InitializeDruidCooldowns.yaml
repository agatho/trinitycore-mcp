  brief: Initializes Druid cooldowns for the CooldownStackingOptimizer class.
  description: The InitializeDruidCooldowns method sets up and configures all relevant
    Druid spell cooldowns within the CooldownStackingOptimizer system. This method
    is responsible for establishing baseline cooldown data structures, registering
    Druid-specific abilities, and preparing the optimizer to handle cooldown management
    for Druid classes in World of Warcraft. It typically runs during class initialization
    or when a new Druid character is loaded into the system. The method ensures that
    all Druid cooldowns are properly tracked and managed according to game mechanics
    and balancing requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeDruidCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a Druid's cooldown management system. It assumes that the underlying cooldown
    tracking infrastructure is already set up and ready to receive Druid-specific
    data.
