  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetSpawnGroupsForMap(uint32 mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of spawn group identifiers associated with the specified
    map.
  description: The GetSpawnGroupsForMap method returns a constant pointer to an array
    of integers representing the spawn groups that are active or defined for the given
    map ID. This functionality is used within TrinityCore's object spawning and management
    system to determine which spawn groups should be considered when loading creatures,
    game objects, or other entities on a specific map. The returned array is managed
    internally by the ObjectMgr class and must not be modified by callers. It is important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the provided map ID exists
    in the database; it simply returns the associated spawn group data if available.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing spawn group identifiers
    for the specified map. The caller should treat this as read-only and must not
    modify or free the memory. If no spawn groups are defined for the map, the method
    may return a null pointer or an empty array depending on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Groups for Map
    code: "uint32 mapId = 0; // Example: Eastern Kingdoms\nconst int* spawnGroups\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnGroupsForMap(mapId);\nif (spawnGroups != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; spawnGroups[i] != -1; ++i) // Assuming -1 marks end of\
      \ list\n    {\n        printf(\"Spawn Group ID: %d\\n\", spawnGroups[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that are populated during
    server startup or map loading. The returned array is only valid for the duration
    of the current session and should not be cached across different contexts. Performance-wise,
    this method typically performs a lookup in an internal hash map or similar structure,
    making it relatively fast but dependent on map data initialization.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the contents of the returned array as it is managed
    internally by ObjectMgr. Also, ensure that the map ID passed to this method corresponds
    to a valid loaded map; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or return unexpected
    results.
