    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player should accept a group invitation from a specified
    inviter.
  description: The ShouldAcceptInvitation method evaluates whether the current player
    should accept a group invitation based on various game rules and settings. It
    typically checks conditions such as whether the inviter is in the player's friend
    list, if the player has reached maximum group size limits, or if there are any
    restrictions imposed by the server configuration. This method is crucial for maintaining
    proper group dynamics and ensuring that players can only join groups under appropriate
    circumstances. The method does not take any parameters beyond the internal state
    of the GroupInvitationHandler class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player should accept the invitation, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that all checks have passed and the invitation
    is acceptable according to game rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Handling Logic
    code: "if (groupInvitationHandler.ShouldAcceptInvitation(inviterGuid)) {\n   \
      \ // Accept the group invitation\n    player.AcceptGroupInvite();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Decline the group invitation\n    player.DeclineGroupInvite();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group invitation processing to determine
    if a player should be allowed to join a group. It may involve checking internal
    state variables such as the inviter's GUID and comparing against player settings
    or server rules.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring that an invitation has
    been issued. The method assumes that it is being called in a valid context where
    an invitation exists, and calling it outside of this context may lead to undefined
    behavior.
