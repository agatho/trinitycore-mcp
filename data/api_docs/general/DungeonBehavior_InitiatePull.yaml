  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: InitiatePull
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::InitiatePull(Group * group, const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a pull event for a group within a dungeon environment, spawning
    the specified number of enemies.
  description: The InitiatePull method is responsible for starting a combat encounter
    in a dungeon scenario by spawning a predetermined number of enemy units for a
    given group. This method typically serves as part of the dungeon's AI behavior
    system, managing the transition from idle state to active combat. It handles the
    creation and positioning of enemies within the dungeon environment, ensuring that
    the group faces appropriate opposition based on the dungeon's difficulty and current
    phase. The method is generally called when a group enters a specific area or triggers
    an event that initiates combat. Precondition includes having a valid Group object
    and a positive integer representing enemy count. Postcondition involves the group
    being engaged in combat with newly spawned enemies.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that will initiate the pull. Must be
      a valid group with members present. The group's current location and dungeon
      context determine where enemies are spawned.
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer specifying the number of enemy units to spawn
      for this pull. Value must be positive and within the bounds defined by the dungeon's
      enemy spawning configuration. Represents the combat difficulty level for this
      encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pull Initiation
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(guid);\nif (dungeonGroup)\n\
      {\n    int enemyCount = 3;\n    dungeonBehavior->InitiatePull(dungeonGroup,\
      \ enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Pull Based on Group Size
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(guid);\nif (dungeonGroup)\n\
      {\n    int enemyCount = dungeonGroup->GetMembersCount() * 2;\n    dungeonBehavior->InitiatePull(dungeonGroup,\
      \ enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the dungeon's spawn point system and may
    trigger additional events such as sound effects, visual effects, or quest updates.
    The actual spawning of enemies is probably deferred to a later update cycle to
    avoid immediate combat issues. It's recommended that this method be called only
    when the group is in a valid dungeon instance and not during transitions.
  warnings: Calling InitiatePull with a zero or negative enemy count may result in
    undefined behavior or no enemies being spawned. Ensure the Group pointer is valid
    before calling, as passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash. This method
    should only be invoked within appropriate dungeon contexts to prevent incorrect
    enemy spawning outside of intended areas.
