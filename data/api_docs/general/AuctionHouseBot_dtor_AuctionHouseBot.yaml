  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::~AuctionHouseBot()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionHouseBot instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionHouseBot class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures, canceling any active auctions, and ensuring
    proper shutdown of the auction house bot functionality. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when an AuctionHouseBot instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It ensures that no dangling pointers or leaked memory occur during the destruction
    of the auction house bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    AuctionHouseBot bot;\n    // ... use bot ...\n\
      } // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot* bot = new AuctionHouseBot();

      // ... use bot ...

      delete bot; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object cleanup. Ensure that
    all auction operations are properly terminated before destruction to prevent data
    inconsistencies.
  warnings: Directly calling the destructor on a stack-allocated object will result
    in undefined behavior. Always let the compiler manage the lifetime of objects
    unless you're explicitly handling dynamic allocation.
