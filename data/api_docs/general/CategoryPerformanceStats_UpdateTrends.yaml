documentation:
  brief: Updates performance trend data for category statistics within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The UpdateTrends method is responsible for recalculating and refreshing
    performance metrics related to specific categories within the game's statistical
    tracking system. This method typically aggregates recent player activities, server
    load data, or other relevant metrics to maintain up-to-date trend information
    that can be used for analysis, reporting, or in-game feature adjustments. It may
    involve processing queued events, updating internal counters, and storing updated
    values in memory or persistent storage. The method is generally invoked periodically
    by the game's performance monitoring subsystem or triggered manually during specific
    administrative operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats;

      stats.UpdateTrends();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to ensure that performance trends
    reflect current data. Depending on implementation, it may involve locking mechanisms
    or background processing to avoid impacting game performance during high-traffic
    periods.
