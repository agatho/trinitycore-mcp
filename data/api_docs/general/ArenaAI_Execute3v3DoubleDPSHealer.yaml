  class: ArenaAI
  method: Execute3v3DoubleDPSHealer
  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute3v3DoubleDPSHealer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 3v3 double DPS healer AI behavior for a specified player in
    an arena match.
  description: The Execute3v3DoubleDPSHealer method implements the artificial intelligence
    logic for a specific role in a 3v3 arena battle, specifically designed for a healer
    who also functions as a damage dealer. This method determines the appropriate
    actions for the AI-controlled player based on game state, target selection, and
    ability usage. It typically involves managing health potions, healing allies,
    and applying damage-dealing abilities while maintaining optimal positioning and
    resource management. The method is part of the ArenaAI class which governs AI
    behavior in arena environments.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This value is used to determine which specific player's
      AI logic should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Execute3v3DoubleDPSHealer
    code: 'ArenaAI ai;

      int playerIndex = 0;

      ai.Execute3v3DoubleDPSHealer(&playerIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the arena match loop and assumes that
    the player has been properly initialized with appropriate AI settings. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific arena type (3v3, 5v5) and game version.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player index within
    the arena team; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should only
    be called during active arena matches when AI control is enabled.
