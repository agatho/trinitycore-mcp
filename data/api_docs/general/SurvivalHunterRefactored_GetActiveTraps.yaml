  signature: int SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetActiveTraps() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active traps currently deployed by the survival hunter.
  description: The GetActiveTraps method retrieves the number of traps that are currently
    active and placed in the world by the survival hunter. This includes all trap
    types such as Frost Traps, Immolation Traps, Explosive Traps, and others. The
    method is typically used to determine how many traps are currently active for
    gameplay mechanics like trap management, cooldown tracking, or resource allocation.
    It does not distinguish between different trap types, but simply counts all active
    traps. This count may be zero if no traps have been placed or if all placed traps
    have expired or been destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of active traps currently deployed by
    the hunter. Returns 0 if no traps are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int activeTraps = hunter->GetActiveTraps();\nif (activeTraps > 0) {\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Hunter has \" << activeTraps << \" active traps.\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"No active traps.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Trap Management Logic
    code: "void CheckTrapLimit(SurvivalHunterRefactored* hunter) {\n    int currentTraps\
      \ = hunter->GetActiveTraps();\n    if (currentTraps >= 4) {\n        // Prevent\
      \ placing more traps\n        std::cout << \"Maximum trap limit reached.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    } else {\n        // Allow placing a new trap\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Can place a new trap. Currently have \" << currentTraps << \"/4.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only considers traps that are currently active and placed in
    the world. Traps that are in cooldown or have been destroyed will not be counted.
    The implementation likely iterates through the hunter's trap list to count those
    with an active state.
  warnings: The return value may change immediately after calling this method if a
    trap expires or is destroyed by an enemy. It is recommended to cache the result
    if it's used in multiple places within a single game tick.
