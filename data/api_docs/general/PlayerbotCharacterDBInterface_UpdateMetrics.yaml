  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::UpdateMetrics(uint32 responseTimeMs,
    bool isSync, bool hadError)
documentation:
  brief: Updates performance metrics for player bot character database operations.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method records timing and status information for
    database operations performed by player bots. It tracks response times, synchronization
    status, and error conditions to help monitor the health and performance of bot
    character data access. This method is typically called internally by the player
    bot system when completing database transactions, allowing administrators and
    developers to analyze database performance and identify potential bottlenecks
    or issues with bot character data handling.
  parameters:
  - name: responseTimeMs
    description: The time taken to complete the database operation in milliseconds.
      This value represents the duration from when the operation started until it
      completed or failed.
  - name: isSync
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the database operation was performed
      synchronously (true) or asynchronously (false). Synchronous operations block
      execution until completion, while asynchronous operations may return immediately.
  - name: hadError
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the database operation encountered
      any errors during execution. When true, it signifies that an error occurred
      during the operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      // Simulate a database operation with timing and status

      uint32 responseTime = 45;

      bool isSync = true;

      bool hadError = false;

      dbInterface.UpdateMetrics(responseTime, isSync, hadError);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Tracking Example
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      // Simulate an erroneous database operation

      uint32 responseTime = 120;

      bool isSync = false;

      bool hadError = true;

      dbInterface.UpdateMetrics(responseTime, isSync, hadError);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely aggregates performance data for monitoring purposes and
    may be used by internal logging or analytics systems. The implementation should
    be thread-safe as it might be called from multiple bot threads concurrently. Performance
    metrics collected through this method can help identify slow database operations
    that might affect player bot responsiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that responseTimeMs is accurately measured to avoid skewed performance
    data. Be cautious when calling this method with invalid timing values, as they
    may distort overall performance statistics. The method should not be called in
    high-frequency loops without proper batching or throttling.
