  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureQuestCurrencies()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature quest currency requirements from the database into memory
    for use during quest validation.
  description: The LoadCreatureQuestCurrencies method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with quest currency requirements associated with creatures. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that quest systems can properly validate whether players have the required
    currencies to complete quests involving specific creatures. It reads data from
    the creature_questrelation table (or similar) in the database, mapping creature
    entries to their respective quest currency requirements such as gold, reputation,
    or item-based currencies. The loaded data is used by the quest system when checking
    if a player can interact with a creature to start or complete a quest that requires
    specific currencies.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureQuestCurrencies();\n    // ... continue with other\
      \ loading operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. It is thread-safe
    as it operates on internal data structures that are not shared across threads
    during initialization.
