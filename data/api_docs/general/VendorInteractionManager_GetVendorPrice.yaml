  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: GetVendorPrice
  signature: uint64 VendorInteractionManager::GetVendorPrice(Creature * vendor, uint32
    itemId, uint32 vendorSlot, uint32 quantity) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the price of an item from a vendor based on item ID, vendor slot,
    and quantity.
  description: The GetVendorPrice method calculates and returns the cost of purchasing
    a specific item from a vendor in World of Warcraft. It takes into account the
    vendor's pricing structure, potential discounts, item quality, and other game
    mechanics such as player reputation or faction modifiers. The method is typically
    used during vendor interactions to determine how much gold a player must pay for
    an item. This function requires valid inputs for the vendor creature, item ID,
    and vendor slot; otherwise, it may return incorrect or default values. It does
    not modify any state and is purely informational.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor from which
      the item is being purchased. Must be a valid vendor creature with proper vendor
      data loaded.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item for which the price is being retrieved.
      This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: vendorSlot
    description: Index position of the item within the vendor's inventory list. Used
      to identify a specific item slot in the vendor's trade list.
  - name: quantity
    description: Number of items the player intends to purchase. Affects the total
      price calculation, especially for items sold in stacks.
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the total gold cost required to buy
    the specified quantity of the item from the vendor. If invalid parameters are
    provided or no pricing data exists, it may return zero or an unexpected value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint64 price = vendorManager->GetVendorPrice(vendorCreature, 12345, 0, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculating Price for Multiple Items
    code: 'uint32 quantity = 5;

      uint64 totalPrice = vendorManager->GetVendorPrice(vendorCreature, 12345, 0,
      quantity);

      // totalPrice now holds cost for 5 items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal vendor data structures and assumes that the
    vendor has valid item entries loaded. Performance is generally fast since it only
    performs lookups and calculations without complex operations or database access.
    The function is const, meaning it does not alter any member variables of the VendorInteractionManager
    class.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are validated before calling this method
    to avoid incorrect pricing results. Passing invalid vendor pointers or item IDs
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return values. Be cautious when using
    quantity > 1 for items that do not support stacking, as this could result in unexpected
    pricing logic.
