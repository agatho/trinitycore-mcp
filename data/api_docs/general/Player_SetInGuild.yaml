  class: Player
  method: SetInGuild
  signature: void Player::SetInGuild(int guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's guild ID to the specified value.
  description: The SetInGuild method assigns a specific guild ID to a player, effectively
    linking the player to a particular guild within the game world. This method is
    typically used during character creation or when changing guild membership. It
    updates internal player data structures to reflect the new guild association and
    may trigger related updates such as guild rank assignment or faction changes.
    The method does not validate whether the guild ID exists or is valid; it simply
    sets the value in the player's data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild to assign to the player. This
      value should correspond to a valid guild entry in the database, though the method
      does not perform validation checks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetInGuild(12345);

      // Player is now associated with guild ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's internal data structure. It should
    be used carefully during character creation or when changing guilds, as it may
    affect other systems like faction relationships or guild permissions. The method
    does not perform any database operations; it only updates in-memory data.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid guild IDs, as it will result
    in undefined behavior. It is recommended to validate the guild ID before calling
    this method to ensure proper operation.
