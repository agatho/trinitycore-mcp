  class: StormkeeperTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 StormkeeperTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Stormkeeper effect.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Stormkeeper
    buff or debuff currently applied to the target. This method is typically used
    in spell or aura handling logic to determine the intensity or duration of effects
    that scale with stacking. The returned value represents how many times the effect
    has been applied or refreshed, which may influence damage, healing, or other mechanics
    depending on the specific implementation. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe for read-only access during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of stacks applied to the
    Stormkeeper effect. A return value of zero indicates that no stacks are currently
    active.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Stormkeeper Stacks Before Applying Damage
    code: "uint32 stacks = target->GetAura(12345)->GetStacks();\nif (stacks > 0)\n\
      {\n    uint32 damage = baseDamage * stacks;\n    target->DealDamage(caster,\
      \ damage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the aura or effect being queried is properly initialized
    and tracked by the TrinityCore system. It should only be called on valid targets
    that have the Stormkeeper effect applied.
  warnings: Calling this method on a target without the Stormkeeper effect may return
    an undefined value if not properly validated. Always ensure the aura exists before
    calling GetStacks to avoid unexpected behavior.
