  method: GetSlot
  signature: int * BattlePetMgr::GetSlot(BattlePetSlot slot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a pointer to the BattlePet slot data for the specified slot index.
  description: The GetSlot method retrieves a pointer to an integer representing the
    BattlePet slot data for a given slot index. This method is typically used within
    the BattlePet system to access or modify specific pet slots in a player's battle
    pet collection. The returned pointer allows direct manipulation of the slot data,
    which may represent the pet's ID, status, or other metadata associated with that
    particular slot. The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform
    bounds checking internally, so callers must ensure the slot index is within acceptable
    range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the BattlePet slot data. Returns nullptr
    if the specified slot is invalid or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a BattlePet Slot
    code: "int* slotPtr = battlePetMgr->GetSlot(BATTLEPET_SLOT_1);\nif (slotPtr !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    *slotPtr = 12345; // Set the pet ID in slot 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a raw pointer to internal data, so modifications should
    be done carefully. The returned pointer is only valid as long as the BattlePetMgr
    instance remains alive and the slot has not been cleared or reallocated.
  warnings: Direct manipulation of the returned pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    if the underlying data structure changes or becomes invalid. Always validate that
    the slot index is valid before calling this method.
