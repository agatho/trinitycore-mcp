  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetAveragePerformance
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetAveragePerformance(uint32_t botGuid, uint32_t
    lastEpisodes) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average performance metric for a specified bot
    over a given number of recent episodes.
  description: The GetAveragePerformance method computes the mean performance value
    for a specific bot identified by its GUID. It evaluates the bot's performance
    across the most recent episodes, as defined by the lastEpisodes parameter. This
    functionality is typically used in AI learning analytics to assess how well a
    bot has been performing over time. The method assumes that performance data for
    the bot is already collected and stored internally within the LearningAnalytics
    system. The calculation considers only the specified number of latest episodes,
    making it useful for tracking recent trends or evaluating the impact of recent
    training adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose average performance is
      to be calculated. Must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: lastEpisodes
    description: Number of recent episodes to include in the average calculation.
      Must be a positive integer representing the count of latest episodes to consider.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated average performance metric for
    the specified bot over the given number of recent episodes. Returns 0.0 if no
    performance data is available or if the bot GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Average Performance for a Bot
    code: 'float avgPerformance = analytics.GetAveragePerformance(12345, 10);

      // Calculates average performance for bot with GUID 12345 over the last 10 episodes.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle Potential Zero Return Values
    code: "float avgPerformance = analytics.GetAveragePerformance(67890, 5);\nif (avgPerformance\
      \ == 0.0f)\n{\n    // Handle case where no performance data exists for the bot\n\
      \    std::cout << \"No performance data available for bot 67890\" << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Average performance: \" << avgPerformance <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that store bot performance
    metrics. The accuracy of the result depends on the completeness and correctness
    of these stored values. Performance calculations may be cached or computed on-the-fly
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot in the system, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. The method does not
    validate the lastEpisodes parameter beyond it being positive; providing a value
    larger than available episodes will return the average of all available data.
