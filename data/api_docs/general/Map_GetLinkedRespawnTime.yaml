  signature: time_t Map::GetLinkedRespawnTime(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the respawn time of a linked object in the map.
  description: This method returns the respawn time of a linked object within the
    map, which is typically used to determine when a linked creature or GameObject
    will respawn after being destroyed. The method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to manage linked respawns for creatures and game objects
    that are tied to specific respawn conditions. It allows developers to query the
    exact time when a linked object will reappear, which is essential for maintaining
    proper game mechanics and ensuring correct behavior during instance encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the time_t value representing the respawn time of the linked object.
    If no linked respawn exists or the object has been destroyed, it returns 0 indicating
    that no respawn time is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\n time_t respawnTime = map->GetLinkedRespawnTime(12345);\n\
      \ if (respawnTime > 0)\n {\n     // Object will respawn at this time\n }\n else\n\
      \ {\n     // No linked respawn exists\n }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with linked creature or GameObject
    respawn systems. It requires that the object GUID corresponds to a valid linked
    respawn within the map's data structure. Performance considerations include checking
    for valid GUIDs before calling this method, as invalid GUIDs may result in undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be called on objects without proper linked respawn
    information; calling it on invalid GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, ensure that the map object is valid and initialized before calling this
    method.
