documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Beast Mastery Hunter bot with the specified player.
  description: The BeastMasteryHunter constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BeastMasteryHunter AI class, setting up the bot's behavior and capabilities based
    on the provided player object. This method configures the hunter's pet management,
    ability usage, and tactical decision-making for optimal Beast Mastery gameplay.
    The initialization process includes setting up the hunter's target selection logic,
    cooldown tracking, and spell prioritization according to the Beast Mastery specialization.
    This constructor is typically called when creating a new AI-controlled Beast Mastery
    Hunter character within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      BeastMasteryHunter hunterBot(bot);

      // The hunter bot is now initialized with Beast Mastery capabilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new AI-controlled
    Beast Mastery Hunter. The player object must be properly initialized before passing
    it to this constructor. The method assumes the player has the Beast Mastery talent
    specialization and appropriate pet training.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on player characters that are controlled
    by real players, as it will overwrite their existing behavior. Ensure the player
    object is valid and properly allocated before initialization.
