  signature: void LFGQueue::~LFGQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LFGQueue instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~LFGQueue destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the LFGQueue object. This includes removing any queued
    players, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method is automatically
    invoked when an LFGQueue instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    The destructor ensures proper resource management to prevent memory leaks and
    maintain system stability during large-scale player queue operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LFGQueue instance
    code: 'LFGQueue* queue = new LFGQueue();

      // ... use the queue ...

      delete queue; // Triggers ~LFGQueue destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction in scope
    code: "void CreateAndDestroyQueue()\n{\n    LFGQueue queue;\n    // ... perform\
      \ operations with queue ...\n    // ~LFGQueue automatically called here when\
      \ queue goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The LFGQueue class likely maintains internal
    linked lists or containers of player data, which must be properly cleared during
    destruction to avoid memory leaks.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless you're implementing a custom
    container or smart pointer. Calling ~LFGQueue directly on an object that hasn't
    been allocated with 'new' can lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure no other
    threads are accessing the queue during destruction to prevent race conditions.
