  class: PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry
  method: GetType
  signature: PlayerDataElementType PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the data element type associated with this character entry.
  description: The GetType method returns the PlayerDataElementType enumeration value
    that identifies the specific type of data element represented by this PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry
    instance. This is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to categorize and
    process different kinds of player data elements, such as stats, equipment, or
    achievements. The returned value determines how the entry should be interpreted
    and handled within the player data system. This method is typically called during
    data serialization, synchronization, or when querying specific types of character
    information.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A PlayerDataElementType enumeration value indicating the type of this
    character data element. Possible values include but are not limited to: PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_STATS,
    PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_EQUIPMENT, PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_ACHIEVEMENTS, etc.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry entry;\nPlayerDataElementType type = entry.GetType();\n\
      if (type == PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_STATS)\n{\n    // Handle stat data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Type Checking in Data Processing
    code: "void ProcessCharacterEntry(PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry const& entry)\n\
      {\n    switch (entry.GetType())\n    {\n        case PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_STATS:\n\
      \            // Process stat data\n            break;\n        case PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_EQUIPMENT:\n\
      \            // Process equipment data\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Handle unknown type\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify the object state. It's
    designed to be called frequently during data processing loops, so performance
    should be optimal. The returned enumeration value directly corresponds to the
    internal type definition used throughout the TrinityCore player data subsystem.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerDataElementCharacterEntry instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized object may result in
    undefined behavior. This method should not be used for runtime type identification
    without proper validation of the entry's validity.
