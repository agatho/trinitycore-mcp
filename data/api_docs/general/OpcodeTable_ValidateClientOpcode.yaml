  signature: bool OpcodeTable::ValidateClientOpcode(OpcodeClient opcode, const char
    * name) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a client opcode is recognized and properly registered within
    the opcode table.
  description: The ValidateClientOpcode method checks whether a given client opcode
    is valid and has been correctly registered in the opcode table. This function
    ensures that all incoming client messages are from known, supported opcodes to
    maintain game integrity and prevent invalid packet handling. It typically performs
    internal lookups against a predefined set of valid opcodes and returns true if
    the opcode exists, false otherwise. The method is commonly used during server
    initialization or packet processing to verify opcode legitimacy before further
    handling.
  parameters:
  - name: opcode
    description: The client opcode value to validate against the internal opcode table.
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the name of the opcode for
      logging or debugging purposes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified client opcode is valid and registered in
    the opcode table; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (opcodeTable.ValidateClientOpcode(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN, \"CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN\"\
      )) {\n    // Opcode is valid, proceed with handling\n} else {\n    // Invalid\
      \ opcode detected\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in packet processing
    code: "void HandlePacket(WorldPacket& packet) {\n    OpcodeClient opCode = static_cast<OpcodeClient>(packet.GetOpcode());\n\
      \    if (!opcodeTable.ValidateClientOpcode(opCode, \"Unknown Opcode\")) {\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Received invalid client opcode: %u\", opCode);\n \
      \       return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal packet handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, which
    may involve hash table or map-based searches. It's recommended to call this function
    only when necessary to avoid performance overhead during high-frequency packet
    processing.
  warnings: Do not use this method for validating user input directly from packets
    without prior sanitization; it should be used primarily for verifying opcode integrity
    in the context of server-side logic.
