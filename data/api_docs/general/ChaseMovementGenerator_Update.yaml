  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool ChaseMovementGenerator::Update(Unit * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the chasing movement behavior of a unit towards its target.
  description: The Update method in ChaseMovementGenerator handles the logic for moving
    a unit (such as a creature) towards its current target. It calculates the necessary
    movement adjustments, checks for valid target states, and determines whether the
    chase should continue or terminate. This method is typically called during each
    update cycle of the game loop to maintain continuous pursuit behavior. The method
    returns true if the movement was successfully updated, and false if the chase
    should be stopped or if there are issues with the target or movement state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is performing the chasing movement.
      This represents the entity (creature, NPC, etc.) that will move towards its
      target.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer value representing the time elapsed since the last update
      in milliseconds. Used to calculate movement speed and timing for smooth pursuit
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the chase movement was successfully updated and the unit
    continues to pursue its target. Returns false if the chase should be terminated,
    such as when the target is no longer valid, out of range, or when the unit has
    reached its destination.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n \
      \       return;\n\n    if (m_chaseGenerator->Update(me, diff))\n    {\n    \
      \    // Continue chasing\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Stop chasing\n\
      \        m_chaseGenerator = nullptr;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling chase termination conditions
    code: "bool ChaseMovementGenerator::Update(Unit* unit, int32 diff)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!unit || !unit->GetVictim())\n        return false;\n\n    // Check if target\
      \ is still valid\n    if (unit->GetVictim()->IsDead() || !unit->GetVictim()->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return false;\n\n    // Perform movement update logic here\n    //\
      \ ... movement calculations ...\n\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and integrates with the
    movement generator framework. It relies on the unit's current target being valid
    and accessible. The method may be called multiple times per game tick, so performance
    considerations are important for smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null.
    Passing an invalid or destroyed unit pointer can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Also, be cautious about modifying target state within the update loop
    as it may affect the return value and subsequent behavior.
