documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specialization entry represents a pet specialization.
  description: The IsPetSpecialization method checks if the current ChrSpecializationEntry
    instance corresponds to a pet specialization. In World of Warcraft, certain specializations
    are designed specifically for player pets rather than players themselves. This
    method returns true if the specialization is intended for use with a pet, and
    false otherwise. The check typically involves examining internal flags or data
    fields within the specialization entry that indicate its association with pet
    abilities or roles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specialization is designated for a pet; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = sChrSpecializationStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (spec && spec->IsPetSpecialization()) {\n    // Handle pet specialization\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This is a pet specialization\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures within the ChrSpecializationEntry
    class. It's important to ensure that the entry being checked is valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
