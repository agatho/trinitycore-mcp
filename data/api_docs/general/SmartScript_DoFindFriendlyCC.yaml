  class: SmartScript
  method: DoFindFriendlyCC
  signature: void SmartScript::DoFindFriendlyCC(int & creatures, float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds friendly creatures within a specified range and updates the creature
    count.
  description: The DoFindFriendlyCC method searches for friendly creatures in proximity
    to the current SmartScript context. It updates the provided integer reference
    with the number of friendly creatures found within the given range. This method
    is typically used in AI scripts to assess the surrounding environment for allies,
    which can influence decision-making processes such as casting area-of-effect spells
    or initiating group actions. The method operates within the TrinityCore's SmartAI
    framework and relies on the current creature's position and the specified range
    to determine valid targets.
  parameters:
  - name: creatures
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the count of friendly
      creatures found within the specified range.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) to search for friendly creatures.
      Must be a positive value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in SmartAI script
    code: 'int friendlyCount = 0;

      float searchRange = 10.0f;

      DoFindFriendlyCC(friendlyCount, searchRange);

      // friendlyCount now contains the number of friendly creatures within 10 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to trigger conditional behavior
    code: "int friendlyCount = 0;\nfloat searchRange = 25.0f;\nDoFindFriendlyCC(friendlyCount,\
      \ searchRange);\nif (friendlyCount >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast a group buff or summon\
      \ allies\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartScript AI system and should only be called
    from within valid SmartAI contexts. The range parameter affects performance, as
    larger ranges require more computational resources to evaluate. The method does
    not consider line-of-sight or obstacles when determining proximity.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'creatures' reference is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Large range values may impact server
    performance during AI evaluation. This method does not account for creature invisibility
    or stealth states.
