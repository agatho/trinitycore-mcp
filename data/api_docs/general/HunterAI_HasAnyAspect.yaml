  signature: bool HunterAI::HasAnyAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the hunter has any aspect active.
  description: The HasAnyAspect method determines whether the hunter character currently
    has any aspect applied to their gameplay. In World of Warcraft's Hunter class,
    aspects are passive abilities that modify the hunter's behavior or provide bonuses.
    This method is typically used by the AI system to make decisions about when to
    apply or remove aspects based on combat situations. The check includes all standard
    hunter aspects such as Aspect of the Hawk, Aspect of the Monkey, Aspect of the
    Pack, etc., but excludes temporary or buff-based effects that are not classified
    as aspects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any aspect is currently active on the hunter; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the hunter's current state includes one
    or more of the standard hunter aspects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->HasAnyAspect()) {\n    // Hunter already has an aspect\
      \ active\n    // Do not apply another aspect\n} else {\n    // Apply an aspect\
      \ to the hunter\n    player->CastSpell(player, 13165, true); // Aspect of the\
      \ Hawk\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the hunter's aura state or spell application status
    for specific aspect spells. It may be used in conjunction with other AI logic
    to avoid overlapping or conflicting aspect applications.
