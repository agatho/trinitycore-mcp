  class: ContentTuningEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int ContentTuningEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the content tuning entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer representing the bitmask of
    flags defined for a specific ContentTuningEntry. These flags typically define
    various properties or behaviors related to content tuning such as difficulty levels,
    expansion restrictions, or other game-specific modifiers. The returned value can
    be used in bitwise operations to check for specific flag states. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's content management system to determine how
    certain game content should behave or be restricted based on player progression
    or server settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined bitmask of all flags set for this
    ContentTuningEntry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag,
    allowing bitwise checks to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a specific flag is set
    code: "ContentTuningEntry* entry = sContentTuningStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & CONTENT_TUNING_FLAG_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC))\n{\n\
      \    // Handle heroic difficulty content\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flags to filter content
    code: "for (auto const& entry : sContentTuningStore)\n{\n    if (entry->GetFlags()\
      \ & CONTENT_TUNING_FLAG_EXPANSION_RESTRICED)\n    {\n        // Skip expansion-restricted\
      \ content\n        continue;\n    }\n    // Process allowed content\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in game constants
    or enums. Developers should be aware that flag values may change between game
    versions and should verify their usage against current TrinityCore documentation
    or source code. The bitmask approach allows for efficient storage and checking
    of multiple boolean properties within a single integer value.
  warnings: Be cautious when performing bitwise operations on the returned flags without
    proper validation, as incorrect bit masking can lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure
    that flag constants used in comparisons match those defined in the current TrinityCore
    version or game client.
