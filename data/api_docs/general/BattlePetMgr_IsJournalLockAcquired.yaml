documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the battle pet journal lock is currently acquired by the player.
  description: The IsJournalLockAcquired method determines if the player has acquired
    a lock on their battle pet journal. This lock typically prevents certain modifications
    or interactions with the journal while it's active, such as preventing pets from
    being added or removed during specific game events or transactions. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this lock. This functionality
    is relevant in scenarios where the player's battle pet data needs to be protected
    from concurrent modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battle pet journal is currently locked, false otherwise.
    A locked journal usually prevents modifications or interactions until the lock
    is released.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Journal is Locked Before Modifying
    code: "if (!player->GetBattlePetMgr()->IsJournalLockAcquired()) {\n    // Safe\
      \ to modify battle pet journal\n    player->GetBattlePetMgr()->AddBattlePet(...);\n\
      } else {\n    // Journal is locked, avoid modifications\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Battle pet journal is currently locked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the BattlePetMgr to enforce data
    consistency and prevent race conditions when modifying battle pet collections.
    It may be tied to specific game events or UI states where journal modifications
    are temporarily disabled.
