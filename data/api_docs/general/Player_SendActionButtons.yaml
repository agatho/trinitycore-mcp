  brief: Sends action buttons to the player's client
  description: This method sends the player's action buttons to their client, allowing
    them to display the current set of action buttons in their action bar. It is used
    internally by TrinityCore to synchronize the player's action button state with
    their client. The method typically handles the sending of action button data including
    their positions and states, ensuring that the player's action bar reflects the
    correct configuration based on their current state.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when action
    button states need to be updated. It may involve sending data through the client's
    network connection, and should be used carefully to avoid performance issues.
