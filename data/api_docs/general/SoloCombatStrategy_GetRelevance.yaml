  signature: float SoloCombatStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of the solo combat strategy for
    a given bot AI context.
  description: The GetRelevance method evaluates how applicable or effective the SoloCombatStrategy
    is for a specific bot AI instance. It considers various factors such as the bot's
    current health, available mana, target type, and combat situation to determine
    a relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher score indicates that the strategy
    should be prioritized for execution, while a lower score suggests it may not be
    suitable or effective at that moment. This method is typically called during AI
    decision-making processes to dynamically select the most appropriate combat behavior
    based on real-time conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relevance of this strategy
    for the given bot AI context. A score of 0.0 means the strategy is not relevant
    at all, while a score of 1.0 indicates maximum relevance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Logic
    code: "float relevance = strategy->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.5f) {\n\
      \    // Execute solo combat strategy\n    ai->ExecuteStrategy(strategy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Relevance to Compare Multiple Strategies
    code: "SoloCombatStrategy* strategy1 = new SoloCombatStrategy();\nSoloCombatStrategy*\
      \ strategy2 = new SoloCombatStrategy();\nfloat relevance1 = strategy1->GetRelevance(ai);\n\
      float relevance2 = strategy2->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance1 > relevance2)\
      \ {\n    ai->ExecuteStrategy(strategy1);\n} else {\n    ai->ExecuteStrategy(strategy2);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI decision loops
    and should ideally be optimized for performance. The relevance calculation may
    involve checking multiple conditions including player stats, target distance,
    threat level, and available abilities. It's important to note that this method
    does not modify any internal state of the strategy object.
  warnings: The returned relevance score is context-dependent and may vary significantly
    based on the current AI state. Do not assume a fixed relevance value across different
    combat situations. Calling this method in a tight loop without proper caching
    or optimization could impact performance.
