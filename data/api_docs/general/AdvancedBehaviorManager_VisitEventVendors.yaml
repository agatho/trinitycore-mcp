documentation:
  brief: Processes and interacts with event vendors based on the specified world event
    type.
  description: The VisitEventVendors method is responsible for managing interactions
    with event vendors within the game world. It iterates through all active event
    vendors associated with the provided WorldEventType, performing necessary actions
    such as updating vendor inventory, handling quest interactions, or triggering
    event-specific behaviors. This method ensures that players can engage with seasonal
    or special event vendors correctly during ongoing world events. The method typically
    operates during event activation periods and may involve checking player conditions,
    event timers, or quest progress before allowing vendor interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Visit Holiday Event Vendors
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.VisitEventVendors(WORLD_EVENT_HOLIDAY);

      // This call processes all vendors associated with holiday events.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Process All Active Event Vendors
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* manager = sAdvancedBehaviorManager;

      manager->VisitEventVendors(WORLD_EVENT_ALL);

      // Processes all event vendors regardless of specific type.

      // Useful for initializing or resetting event vendor states.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during world event initialization or periodic
    updates. It may involve database queries to fetch vendor data and could be performance-sensitive
    if many vendors exist for an event. The implementation assumes that the WorldEventType
    parameter is valid and that event vendors have been properly registered with the
    system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper event registration may result in undefined
    behavior or missing vendor interactions. Ensure that the WorldEventType passed
    is supported by the current game state and that vendor data is correctly loaded
    before invoking this method.
