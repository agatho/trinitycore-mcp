documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ShadowDanceTracker class with default values.
  description: The ShadowDanceTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ShadowDanceTracker class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures
    required for tracking shadow dance-related events, cooldowns, or effects within
    the TrinityCore framework. It is typically invoked when creating a new tracker
    object to monitor player abilities or NPC behaviors related to shadow dance mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. The constructor ensures that all member variables are properly
    initialized to their default states, preparing the object for subsequent method
    calls and gameplay interactions.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ShadowDanceTracker instance
    code: 'ShadowDanceTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track shadow dance events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or external
    lookups. It simply sets up the basic internal state of the tracker object. Developers
    should ensure that any necessary setup for tracking specific shadow dance mechanics
    is handled through dedicated methods rather than in the constructor.
