api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: SellAllJunk
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SellAllJunk(Player * bot, Creature * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Sells all junk items in the bot's inventory to the specified vendor.
  description: The SellAllJunk method iterates through the player's inventory and
    identifies all items that are considered 'junk' (typically items with low value
    or no use). It then attempts to sell these items to the provided vendor creature.
    The method handles the transaction process, including updating the player's inventory
    and currency. This functionality is commonly used in automated bot systems to
    manage inventory and optimize gold accumulation. The method requires that the
    player be within interaction range of the vendor and that the vendor accepts the
    items being sold.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose inventory
      will be processed for selling junk items.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor to whom junk
      items will be sold.
  returns: Returns true if at least one junk item was successfully sold, or false
    if no junk items were found or if the selling process failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SellAllJunk
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nbool result = bot->GetInteractionManager()->SellAllJunk(bot,\
      \ vendor);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Junk items were sold\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Successfully sold junk items.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No junk items found or\
      \ selling failed\n    sLog->outString(\"No junk items to sell or sale failed.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor is within valid trading range and supports
    the selling of junk items. It may perform multiple transactions if there are many
    junk items to sell, which could impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and vendor pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes. The method does not check for vendor capacity or item
    stacking limits, which might lead to unexpected behavior in certain edge cases.
