  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: GetCurrentSpawnInterval
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::GetCurrentSpawnInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current spawn interval value used by the adaptive spawn throttler.
  description: The GetCurrentSpawnInterval method retrieves the currently active spawn
    interval in milliseconds. This value determines how frequently spawns occur within
    the adaptive spawning system, which is designed to dynamically adjust spawn rates
    based on server load and player activity. The returned interval may vary over
    time as the throttler adapts to environmental conditions. This method is typically
    used for monitoring or debugging purposes to understand the current adaptive behavior
    of the spawn system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current spawn interval in milliseconds.
    This value indicates how long the system will wait between spawning events, with
    higher values resulting in less frequent spawns and lower values leading to more
    frequent spawns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      uint32 interval = throttler.GetCurrentSpawnInterval();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Current spawn interval: %u ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Spawn Rate
    code: "void MonitorSpawnRate(AdaptiveSpawnThrottler& throttler)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ currentInterval = throttler.GetCurrentSpawnInterval();\n    if (currentInterval\
      \ > 5000)\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"server\", \"High spawn interval detected: %u\
      \ ms\", currentInterval);\n    else if (currentInterval < 1000)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"Low spawn interval detected: %u ms\", currentInterval);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    value may change dynamically as the adaptive throttler adjusts to server conditions.
    This method does not modify internal state, making it safe for frequent calls
    during runtime.
  warnings: The interval value returned by this method should not be used directly
    to control spawn timing logic, as it's intended for monitoring and debugging rather
    than as a control mechanism. Changes in the interval may occur without explicit
    calls to setter methods.
