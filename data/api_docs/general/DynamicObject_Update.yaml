  class: DynamicObject
  method: Update
  signature: void DynamicObject::Update(int p_time)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dynamic object's state and position based on the time delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    a DynamicObject, typically handling movement, duration tracking, and visual updates.
    This method is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that dynamic objects
    such as area effects, traps, or spell visualizations are properly maintained and
    removed when their duration expires. It processes time-based changes and ensures
    that the object's behavior remains synchronized with the game world's progression.
  parameters:
  - name: p_time
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to calculate movement, duration expiration, and other time-dependent
      behaviors of the dynamic object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      int deltaTime = 100; // milliseconds

      dynObj->Update(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update in Game Loop Context
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& obj : m_dynamicObjects)\n\
      \    {\n        obj->Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the core game loop and should not be
    called directly unless implementing custom behavior. The time delta parameter
    must be accurately calculated to ensure proper timing of effects.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or negative time values may cause unexpected
    behavior, such as premature removal or incorrect positioning of dynamic objects.
