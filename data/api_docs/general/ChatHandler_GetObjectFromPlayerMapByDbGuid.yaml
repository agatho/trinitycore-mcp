  signature: GameObject * ChatHandler::GetObjectFromPlayerMapByDbGuid(int lowguid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a GameObject from the player's map using its database GUID.
  description: The GetObjectFromPlayerMapByDbGuid method searches for and returns
    a GameObject instance within the current player's map based on the provided low
    GUID, which corresponds to the GameObject's entry in the database. This method
    is typically used in game command implementations or scripting contexts where
    access to specific GameObjects is required. The returned pointer may be null if
    no matching GameObject exists in the player's current map or if the GameObject
    has been destroyed.
  parameters:
  - name: lowguid
    description: The low GUID value representing the database identifier of the GameObject
      to retrieve.
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject instance if found in the player's current map;
    otherwise, returns nullptr if no such GameObject exists or is accessible.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a GameObject by its Database GUID
    code: "GameObject* go = handler->GetObjectFromPlayerMapByDbGuid(12345);\nif (go)\n\
      {\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Found GameObject: %s\", go->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    handler->SendSysMessage(\"GameObject not found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the player's current map and may
    not return GameObjects that are located in different maps or zones. It is primarily
    intended for use in command handlers where the player's active map context is
    relevant.
