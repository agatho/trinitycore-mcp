  method: ClearInteraction
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::ClearInteraction()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all active NPC interaction data and resets the interaction state.
  description: The ClearInteraction method is responsible for resetting the internal
    state of an NPCInteractionManager instance, removing any ongoing or stored interaction
    data with NPCs. This typically involves clearing cached player-NPC dialogue states,
    quest progress information, and any temporary interaction flags that may have
    been set during previous interactions. The method ensures a clean slate for new
    interactions by nullifying all references to active conversations or pending actions
    related to NPC interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager interactionManager;

      interactionManager.ClearInteraction();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Interaction Before New Dialogue
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    NPCInteractionManager&\
      \ manager = sObjectAccessor->GetNPCInteractionManager(player);\n    manager.ClearInteraction();\n\
      \    // Proceed with new interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new NPC interaction sequence
    to ensure no stale data interferes with the current dialogue or quest state. It
    is typically invoked internally by the core when a player exits an NPC interaction
    context.
  warnings: Calling ClearInteraction while an NPC interaction is actively in progress
    may result in unexpected behavior or loss of ongoing dialogue state. Ensure that
    all active interactions are properly concluded before calling this method.
