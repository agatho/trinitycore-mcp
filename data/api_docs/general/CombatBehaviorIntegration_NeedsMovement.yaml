documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat behavior integration requires movement for
    the current combat state
  description: The NeedsMovement method evaluates the current combat scenario to determine
    if the AI-controlled unit needs to perform movement actions. This includes checking
    factors such as target distance, threat level, positioning requirements, and combat
    strategy. The method is typically called during the AI update cycle to decide
    whether to initiate or continue movement behaviors. It considers both immediate
    tactical needs and longer-term strategic positioning within the combat environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state requires movement actions, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI should consider executing
    movement behaviors such as approaching targets, repositioning, or fleeing based
    on combat conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Update
    code: "if (combatBehavior->NeedsMovement()) {\n    // Initiate movement behavior\n\
      \    unit->GetAI()->MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Decision Logic
    code: "bool shouldMove = combatBehavior->NeedsMovement();\nif (shouldMove && !unit->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_MOVING))\
      \ {\n    // Execute movement only if not already moving\n    unit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI updates, so performance
    considerations are important. The implementation may cache certain state values
    to avoid expensive recalculations on every call. The method should be used in
    conjunction with other combat state checks to make comprehensive movement decisions.
  warnings: Do not use this method as the sole determinant for movement without considering
    other factors like pathfinding availability, unit capabilities, or environmental
    constraints. Always verify that movement is actually possible before attempting
    to execute it.
