  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: GetMap
  signature: Map * OutdoorPvP::GetMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Map object associated with this OutdoorPvP instance.
  description: The GetMap method retrieves the Map object that the OutdoorPvP instance
    is managing or associated with. This allows access to map-specific data and functionality,
    such as terrain information, player positions, and zone-related events. The returned
    pointer can be used to interact with the underlying map environment for outdoor
    PvP operations. This method is typically called during event handling, zone updates,
    or when needing to perform map-specific actions related to the OutdoorPvP area.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Map object associated with this OutdoorPvP instance. Returns
    nullptr if the OutdoorPvP has not been properly initialized or is not associated
    with a valid map.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Map from OutdoorPvP
    code: "OutdoorPvP* outdoorPvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvP(1234);\nif (outdoorPvp)\n\
      {\n    Map* map = outdoorPvp->GetMap();\n    if (map)\n    {\n        // Use\
      \ the map object for further operations\n        sLog->outString(\"Map ID: %u\"\
      , map->GetId());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a cached reference to the associated
    Map. The returned pointer should not be deleted or modified as it's managed by
    the core system. This method is thread-safe for read operations.
