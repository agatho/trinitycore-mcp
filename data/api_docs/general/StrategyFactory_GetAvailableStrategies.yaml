  class: StrategyFactory
  method: GetAvailableStrategies
  signature: int StrategyFactory::GetAvailableStrategies() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of available AI strategies within the StrategyFactory.
  description: The GetAvailableStrategies method returns an integer representing the
    number of AI strategies currently registered and available for use within the
    StrategyFactory. This count typically reflects the number of strategy definitions
    loaded into memory, which can be used by AI systems to determine how many different
    behaviors or decision-making patterns are accessible. The method is read-only
    and does not modify any internal state. It's commonly used during initialization
    or debugging phases to verify that all expected strategies have been properly
    loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of available AI strategies
    in the factory. A return value of zero indicates no strategies are registered,
    while a positive integer reflects the actual count of loaded strategies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int strategyCount = strategyFactory.GetAvailableStrategies();\nif (strategyCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    printf(\"Loaded %d AI strategies\\n\", strategyCount);\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"No AI strategies available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should have minimal performance
    impact. It is typically called during system startup or when debugging AI behavior
    to confirm strategy availability.
