    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of skill line ability IDs associated with the specified
    skill ID.
  description: The GetSkillLineAbilitiesBySkill method fetches a list of skill line
    ability identifiers that are linked to a given skill ID. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine which abilities or skills are
    tied to a particular profession or skill line. The returned pointer points to
    an internal array managed by the DB2Manager, and the caller must not free or modify
    this memory. The method assumes that the skill ID provided corresponds to a valid
    entry in the database and returns NULL if no matching entries are found.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of skill line ability IDs associated
    with the specified skill ID, or NULL if no abilities are found for the given skill.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve skill line abilities for a crafting skill
    code: "const int* abilities = sDB2Manager->GetSkillLineAbilitiesBySkill(164);\
      \ // Blacksmithing\nif (abilities != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; abilities[i]\
      \ != -1; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Ability ID: %d\\n\", abilities[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is null-terminated with -1 to indicate the end of the
    list. This method relies on internal data structures that are populated during
    server startup from DB2 files, so it should only be called after the database
    has been fully loaded.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the memory pointed to by the returned
    pointer. The array is managed internally and may become invalid if the DB2Manager's
    internal state changes.
