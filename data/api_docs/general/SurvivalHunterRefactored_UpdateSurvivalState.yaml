documentation:
  brief: Updates the survival state of the hunter based on current game conditions
    and abilities.
  description: The UpdateSurvivalState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the survival mechanics specific to a hunter class character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method evaluates the hunter's current environment, resource levels,
    and combat status to determine appropriate survival behaviors such as stance adjustments,
    ability usage, or tactical positioning. It integrates with the broader AI system
    to ensure that the hunter responds dynamically to changing battlefield conditions
    while maintaining optimal survival strategies. The method typically runs during
    each AI update cycle and may trigger various survival-related actions based on
    internal state checks.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_hunter->UpdateSurvivalState();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The implementation
    likely involves checking for environmental hazards, enemy proximity, health levels,
    and resource availability to make tactical decisions.
