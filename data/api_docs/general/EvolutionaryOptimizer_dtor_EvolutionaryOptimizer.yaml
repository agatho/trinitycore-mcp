  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::~EvolutionaryOptimizer()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EvolutionaryOptimizer instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the EvolutionaryOptimizer class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    EvolutionaryOptimizer instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore, this could be related to AI behavior optimization
    or evolutionary algorithms used in NPC decision-making processes. The destructor
    should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when the object is no longer
    needed, and developers should not manually invoke it unless performing explicit
    cleanup.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of EvolutionaryOptimizer
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;\n    // Use\
      \ optimizer...\n    // Destructor called automatically when optimizer goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of EvolutionaryOptimizer pointer
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer* optimizer = new EvolutionaryOptimizer();

      // Use optimizer...

      del<|fim_suffix|>ete optimizer; // Triggers destructor

      optimizer = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not throw exceptions as it's called during stack unwinding.
    If the class manages resources that require special cleanup logic, ensure that
    the destructor properly handles those cases. In TrinityCore's context, this might
    be used in AI modules where evolutionary algorithms are employed for optimizing
    NPC behaviors.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor manually unless you have a specific reason
    and understand the implications. Never call delete on an object whose destructor
    has already been invoked. Be cautious about virtual destructors if this class
    is intended to be inherited from.
