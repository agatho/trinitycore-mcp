  class: Battleground
  method: _ProcessProgress
  signature: void Battleground::_ProcessProgress(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground's progress state based on elapsed time.
  description: The _ProcessProgress method is an internal utility function responsible
    for advancing the state of a battleground instance over time. It handles the progression
    of various battleground mechanics such as capturing objectives, updating timers,
    and managing win/loss conditions. This method is typically called during the battleground's
    update cycle to ensure that game state transitions occur correctly as time passes.
    The method takes a time difference parameter to calculate how much progress should
    be made in the current battleground state.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) since the last update call.
      This value determines how much time has passed and is used to advance the battleground's
      internal state accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within battleground update loop
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    _ProcessProgress(diff);\n    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with battleground timer management
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_bgTimer > 0)\n   \
      \ {\n        m_bgTimer -= diff;\n        _ProcessProgress(diff);\n        if\
      \ (m_bgTimer <= 0)\n            EndBattleground();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use only and should not be called directly
    from external code. It relies on the battleground's internal state machine to
    determine what progress actions to perform. The method may trigger various events
    or state changes depending on the current battleground type and its specific rules.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper update context may lead to inconsistent
    game state or unexpected behavior. Do not invoke _ProcessProgress without ensuring
    that the battleground instance is in a valid state for processing progress updates.
