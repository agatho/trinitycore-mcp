  signature: uint32 BotResourcePool::GetPooledSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of pooled sessions available in the bot resource
    pool.
  description: The GetPooledSessionCount method retrieves the number of session objects
    currently stored in the bot resource pool. This pool typically contains pre-initialized
    session instances that can be reused by bots to reduce overhead and improve performance.
    The returned value indicates how many sessions are ready for allocation without
    requiring new object construction. This count may fluctuate as sessions are acquired
    and released from the pool during bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pooled sessions currently available
    in the resource pool. Returns zero if no sessions are pooled or if the pool is
    empty.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Sessions Before Allocation
    code: "uint32 availableSessions = botResourcePool->GetPooledSessionCount();\n\
      if (availableSessions > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with session allocation\n    BotSession*\
      \ session = botResourcePool->AcquireSession();\n    // Use the session...\n\
      \    botResourcePool->ReleaseSession(session);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no sessions are available\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"No pooled sessions\
      \ available for bot usage\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the bot system to determine resource
    availability before attempting session allocation. The pool size may be dynamically
    adjusted based on system load and configuration settings.
