  method: GroupMemberInfo
  signature: void GroupMemberInfo::GroupMemberInfo(uint32 guid, GroupRole r, uint32
    lvl, uint8 cls, uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GroupMemberInfo object with player GUID, role, level, class,
    and specialization data.
  description: The GroupMemberInfo constructor initializes an object that holds information
    about a group member in World of Warcraft. This includes the player's unique identifier
    (GUID), their role within the group (such as main tank, healer, or damage dealer),
    their character level, class, and specilization. The data is used internally by
    TrinityCore to manage group compositions, role assignments, and player statistics
    within raid and party contexts. This constructor is typically called when creating
    new group member entries or updating existing ones during group operations like
    joining, leaving, or reorganizing groups.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the player character. This
      value uniquely identifies the player across the game world and is used for all
      player-related operations.
  - name: r
    description: The group role assigned to the member, typically indicating their
      primary function in the group such as TANK, HEALER, or DAMAGE. This role affects
      how the group system assigns responsibilities and displays information.
  - name: lvl
    description: The current level of the player character. This value determines
      the player's capabilities, available abilities, and scaling factors for various
      game mechanics.
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier of the player character. This corresponds to
      the standard WoW class enumeration (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc.) and is used
      for class-specific logic and UI display.
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization ID of the player character. This indicates which
      specific specialization within their class they are using (e.g., Frost Mage,
      Arms Warrior) and affects ability selection and gameplay mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a GroupMemberInfo for a Warrior Tank
    code: GroupMemberInfo member(123456789, GROUP_ROLE_TANK, 80, CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_WARRIOR_PROTECTION);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a GroupMemberInfo for a Mage Healer
    code: GroupMemberInfo member(987654321, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, 80, CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_ARCANE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal group management system in TrinityCore.
    It's typically not called directly by external modules but rather through group-related
    APIs. The GroupMemberInfo object is used primarily for maintaining group state
    and displaying role information to players.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player character, otherwise the group member data may become inconsistent. The
    role parameter should be one of the predefined GROUP_ROLE_* constants to maintain
    compatibility with group mechanics.
