  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::BackupDatabase(const std::string & backupPath)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a backup of the playerbot database to the specified path
  description: The BackupDatabase method performs a complete backup of the playerbot-related
    database tables to a specified file path. This functionality is typically used
    during migration processes or when preparing for system maintenance. The method
    ensures data integrity by locking relevant database sections during the backup
    operation. It returns true upon successful completion and false if any errors
    occur during the backup process, such as insufficient permissions, invalid paths,
    or database connection issues.
  parameters:
  - name: backupPath
    description: The absolute or relative file path where the database backup will
      be stored. This should point to a valid directory with write permissions and
      sufficient disk space for the backup file.
  returns: True if the database backup was successfully created at the specified location,
    false otherwise. The method will return false if the backup path is invalid, there
    are insufficient permissions, or if the database cannot be accessed during the
    backup operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Backup
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\n\
      bool success = migrationMgr->BackupDatabase(\"/var/lib/trinitycore/playerbot_backup.sql\"\
      );\nif (success) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Database backup completed\
      \ successfully.\");\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Failed to create\
      \ database backup.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may block database operations during execution, so it should
    be called during low-traffic periods. The backup file will contain SQL statements
    that can be used to restore the playerbot data using standard MySQL tools.
  warnings: Ensure that the specified backup path has sufficient disk space and write
    permissions. Failure to do so will result in a failed backup operation. This method
    should not be called concurrently with other database modification operations.
