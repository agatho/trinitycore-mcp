  method: GetFlagTakenFromBaseTime
  signature: time_t GameObject::GetFlagTakenFromBaseTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base time when a flag was taken from the GameObject.
  description: This method retrieves the timestamp indicating when a flag was taken
    from the GameObject, typically used in flag capture mechanics. The returned value
    represents the time when the flag was captured or taken by a player, which is
    essential for determining cooldown periods and game state tracking. This method
    is commonly used in battleground and arena systems where flags are captured and
    must be reset after a certain period.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the base time when the flag was taken
    from the GameObject. This timestamp is used to calculate cooldown periods and
    determine when the flag can be captured again.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: time_t flagTakenTime = gameObject->GetFlagTakenFromBaseTime();
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in cooldown calculation
    code: "time_t flagTakenTime = gameObject->GetFlagTakenFromBaseTime();\nif (time(nullptr)\
      \ - flagTakenTime > 300) {\n    // Flag is available for capture\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flag-related methods
    to track the state of flags in battlegrounds. The returned time_t value represents
    a Unix timestamp and should be compared against current time using standard time
    functions.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no flag has been taken yet, which could
    lead to incorrect cooldown calculations if not handled properly. Always check
    for zero values before performing time-based calculations.
