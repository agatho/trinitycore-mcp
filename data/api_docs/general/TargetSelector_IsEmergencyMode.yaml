  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsEmergencyMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the target selector is currently in emergency mode.
  description: The IsEmergencyMode method determines whether the target selector is
    operating in emergency mode. This mode typically activates when the AI system
    detects critical conditions such as low health, imminent threat, or system failure.
    When in emergency mode, the target selector may prioritize different targeting
    criteria, such as selecting the nearest threat or focusing on healing targets
    instead of damage dealers. The method returns a boolean value indicating the current
    operational state of the target selection logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target selector is currently in emergency mode, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the AI has triggered emergency targeting protocols
    based on current combat conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsEmergencyMode()) {\n    // Handle emergency targeting\
      \ logic\n    targetSelector.SelectTarget(TargetingFlags::TARGETING_FLAG_EMERGENCY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Emergency Mode Check
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 20 && !targetSelector.IsEmergencyMode())\
      \ {\n        targetSelector.SetEmergencyMode(true);\n    } else if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ > 30 && targetSelector.IsEmergencyMode()) {\n        targetSelector.SetEmergencyMode(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with SetEmergencyMode to control
    the AI's targeting behavior during critical situations. The emergency mode may
    affect how targets are prioritized, which spells are cast, and overall combat
    strategy.
  warnings: Ensure that emergency mode logic does not interfere with normal AI operations.
    Improper handling of emergency states might cause unexpected behavior in target
    selection or spell casting sequences.
