documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GossipHandler instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GossipHandler class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this typically
    involves releasing references to player data, gossip menu entries, or other temporary
    structures that may have been created during interaction handling. The destructor
    ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks when a GossipHandler
    instance is no longer needed. This method does not require any specific preconditions
    as it is automatically invoked during object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of GossipHandler
    code: "void HandlePlayerGossip(Player* player)\n{\n    GossipHandler handler;\n\
      \    // ... perform gossip operations ...\n    // handler is automatically destroyed\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when a GossipHandler object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    does not need to be manually invoked in most cases, as C++ handles the cleanup
    automatically. Developers should ensure that no external references to the handler
    remain after destruction.
