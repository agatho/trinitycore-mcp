documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of elements currently in the action priority queue
  description: The Size method retrieves the current count of elements stored in the
    ActionPriorityQueue. This method is commonly used to determine how many actions
    are pending execution or waiting in the priority queue. The returned value represents
    the total number of items that can be processed by the queue, which is essential
    for managing action execution flow and resource allocation within the TrinityCore
    AI system. The method performs a constant-time operation and does not modify the
    queue's contents.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of elements currently present in
    the ActionPriorityQueue
  examples:
  - title: Check queue size before adding new action
    code: "ActionPriorityQueue queue;\n// ... add some actions to queue ...\nsize_t\
      \ currentSize = queue.Size();\nif (currentSize < MAX_ACTIONS)\n{\n    // Add\
      \ new action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor queue growth during AI processing
    code: "void ProcessAI()\n{\n    ActionPriorityQueue* actionQueue = GetActionQueue();\n\
      \    size_t previousSize = actionQueue->Size();\n    \n    // Perform AI logic\
      \ that may add actions\n    ExecuteNextAction();\n    \n    size_t newSize =\
      \ actionQueue->Size();\n    if (newSize > previousSize)\n    {\n        // Log\
      \ or handle queue growth\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Action queue\
      \ grew from %zu to %zu\", previousSize, newSize);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where the ActionPriorityQueue
    instance is accessible. The returned size value is consistent with the queue's
    internal counter and reflects all elements including those that may have been
    marked for removal but not yet processed.
