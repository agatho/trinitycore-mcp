  signature: MechanicPrediction MechanicAwareness::PredictNextMechanic(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the next mechanic that will be applied to the target unit based
    on current awareness state.
  description: The PredictNextMechanic method analyzes the current state of a target
    unit and determines which mechanic (such as a spell effect or aura) is most likely
    to be applied next. This prediction takes into account various factors including
    active auras, cooldowns, and game mechanics such as periodic effects or proc-based
    abilities. The method returns a MechanicPrediction structure that contains information
    about the predicted mechanic, its type, timing, and potential duration. This functionality
    is primarily used in AI decision-making processes to anticipate enemy actions
    or plan countermeasures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MechanicPrediction object containing details about the predicted mechanic,
    including its type, expected timing, and duration. Returns an empty or invalid
    prediction if no mechanic can be reliably predicted based on current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "MechanicPrediction prediction = awareness.PredictNextMechanic(target);\n\
      if (prediction.IsValid()) {\n    // Use prediction to determine next action\n\
      \    switch (prediction.GetMechanicType()) {\n        case MECHANIC_STUN:\n\
      \            // Prepare for stun avoidance\n            break;\n        case\
      \ MECHANIC_ROOT:\n            // Plan movement strategy\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the target unit's mechanics
    and may not be accurate if the target is under certain effects that obscure mechanic
    application. The prediction accuracy improves with more comprehensive awareness
    data and may be affected by timing precision requirements in fast-paced combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: The returned MechanicPrediction should not be assumed to be 100% accurate
    due to the dynamic nature of game mechanics. Relying solely on predictions without
    verification can lead to incorrect AI behavior or missed opportunities for counterplay.
