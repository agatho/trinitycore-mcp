  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ExecuteQuestObjective
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteQuestObjective(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specific quest objective for a player bot within the dynamic quest
    system.
  description: The ExecuteQuestObjective method triggers the execution of a specified
    quest objective for a given player bot. This method is typically used in automated
    quest progression systems where bots need to complete specific objectives without
    manual intervention. It handles the internal logic required to advance quest progress,
    update objective counters, and potentially reward players upon completion. The
    method operates on a predefined quest ID and an objective index that identifies
    which specific objective within the quest should be executed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest objective. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective to be executed.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest to execute. Zero-based
      indexing, must be less than the total number of objectives in the quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Objective Execution
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteQuestObjective(bot, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Multiple Objectives in Sequence
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < GetQuestObjectiveCount(questId);\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteQuestObjective(bot, questId, i);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has already accepted the quest and
    that all prerequisites for the objective are met. The implementation may internally
    check if the objective is already completed before re-executing it. Performance
    considerations include database lookups and potential packet sending to update
    client UI.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or objectiveIndex can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot player is valid and has
    accepted the specified quest before calling this method. Do not call this method
    from within a quest event handler without proper safeguards to prevent recursion.
