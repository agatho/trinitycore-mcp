  class: Map
  method: GetOrGenerateZoneDefaultWeather
  signature: Weather * Map::GetOrGenerateZoneDefaultWeather(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or generates the default weather for a specified zone.
  description: This method fetches the default weather conditions for a given zone
    ID, creating a new weather instance if one doesn't already exist. It is used primarily
    in World of Warcraft's weather system to manage environmental conditions within
    specific zones. The method ensures that each zone has a consistent weather state,
    which affects gameplay mechanics such as visibility, combat, and player experience.
    This function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of zone-based weather systems
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Weather object representing the default weather
    for the specified zone. If no weather exists for the zone, it generates one and
    returns that pointer. Returns nullptr if the zone ID is invalid or if the weather
    system fails to initialize properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Weather* weather = map->GetOrGenerateZoneDefaultWeather(1234);\nif (weather)\n\
      {\n    // Use weather object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments. Performance considerations arise when frequently accessing zone
    weather data, as it may involve database operations or cache updates. Implementation
    details include handling of zone ID validation and default weather creation logic.
  warnings: This method should not be called during map initialization without proper
    synchronization, as it may cause race conditions. Avoid calling this method in
    loops without caching results, as it can lead to performance degradation.
