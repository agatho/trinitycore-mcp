  method: CreateFallbackSession
  signature: std::shared_ptr<BotSession> BotSessionFactory::CreateFallbackSession(int
    characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a fallback bot session for a given character GUID.
  description: The CreateFallbackSession method is responsible for generating a new
    BotSession instance that serves as a fallback option when no regular session can
    be established for a specific character. This typically occurs in scenarios where
    a bot needs to operate with default settings or when the normal session creation
    process fails. The method takes a character GUID as input and returns a shared
    pointer to a newly created BotSession object, which encapsulates the bot's operational
    context and state. This mechanism ensures that bots can continue functioning even
    under failure conditions, maintaining system stability.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character for which the fallback
      session is to be created. This value must correspond to an existing character
      in the database and should be a valid integer representing the character's ID.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<BotSession> pointing to the newly created fallback bot
    session. Returns nullptr if the session creation fails due to invalid input or
    internal errors during initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of CreateFallbackSession
    code: "int characterGuid = 12345;\nstd::shared_ptr<BotSession> fallbackSession\
      \ = sessionFactory->CreateFallbackSession(characterGuid);\nif (fallbackSession)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with using the fallback session\n    fallbackSession->Initialize();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to create fallback\
      \ session\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the character with the provided GUID exists in the
    database. It may perform internal checks or database lookups to validate the character's
    existence before creating the session. The returned session is not automatically
    initialized and requires explicit initialization by the caller.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid characterGuid (e.g., a non-existent
    character) might lead to undefined behavior or exceptions depending on implementation
    details. Ensure that all GUIDs passed are validated against the database before
    calling this method.
