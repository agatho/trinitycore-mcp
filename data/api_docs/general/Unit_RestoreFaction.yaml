  brief: Restores the faction status of a unit to its original state.
  description: The RestoreFaction method resets the faction relationship of a Unit
    object to its default state, typically restoring the unit's original faction settings
    after being modified by game mechanics or player actions. This method is commonly
    used in scenarios where faction changes are temporary or need to be reverted.
    It ensures that the unit's faction status returns to what it was before any modifications
    were applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit();\n target->RestoreFaction();\n // Faction status\
      \ restored to original state"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during game events or when resetting player
    behavior. It may be used in conjunction with other faction-related methods like
    SetFaction or ModifyFaction. Implementation details depend on how the unit's faction
    was modified, and it should be used carefully to avoid unintended side effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in faction
    interactions. Ensure that the unit's faction is properly restored before calling
    this method, especially if other methods have been applied.
