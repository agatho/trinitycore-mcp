  class: GuardianIronfurTracker
  method: ApplyIronfur
  signature: void GuardianIronfurTracker::ApplyIronfur(uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Ironfur ability to a guardian unit with the specified duration.
  description: The ApplyIronfur method activates the Ironfur buff on a guardian creature,
    typically used by druids in their guardian form. This ability provides increased
    armor and damage reduction for a set duration. The method modifies the guardian's
    state and applies relevant aura effects that enhance its survivability in combat.
    It is commonly invoked when a guardian enters combat or when specific spell effects
    are triggered.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Ironfur buff will remain
      active. This value determines how long the guardian benefits from increased
      armor and damage reduction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuardianIronfurTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyIronfur(30000); // Apply Ironfur for 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Duration Based on Spell Power
    code: 'uint32 spellDuration = 30000 + (player->GetSpellPower() * 1000);

      tracker.ApplyIronfur(spellDuration); // Apply Ironfur with duration based on
      player''s spell power'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guardian's aura system and may trigger
    additional events or callbacks. The implementation should ensure that only valid
    guardian units can have Ironfur applied, and that overlapping buffs are handled
    appropriately.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-guardian unit or without proper initialization
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the guardian is in a valid state
    before applying the buff.
