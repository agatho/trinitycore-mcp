    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the expected stat value for a given character level,
    expansion, content tuning, class, and mythic+ milestone season.
  description: The EvaluateExpectedStat method computes a normalized stat value based
    on multiple game parameters including character level, expansion ID, content tuning
    identifier, unit class, and mythic+ milestone season. This function is primarily
    used in World of Warcraft's stat calculation systems to determine how stats scale
    with progression. The method utilizes internal DB2 data tables to retrieve scaling
    factors and applies them according to the provided parameters. It ensures that
    stat values are consistent across different game versions and content updates
    by referencing structured data rather than hardcoded values.
  parameters:
  - name: stat
    description: The expected stat type to evaluate, defined by ExpectedStatType enumeration.
      This specifies which stat (e.g., health, attack power, spell power) is being
      calculated.
  - name: level
    description: The character level used for stat calculation. Must be a valid player
      level within the game's supported range.
  - name: expansion
    description: The expansion ID that determines which set of scaling rules to apply.
      Negative values may indicate special cases or legacy content.
  - name: contentTuningId
    description: Identifier for the specific content tuning, used to adjust stat scaling
      for different zones, instances, or game modes.
  - name: unitClass
    description: The class of the unit (player or NPC) for which the stat is being
      calculated. Negative values may indicate special classes or NPCs.
  - name: mythicPlusMilestoneSeason
    description: The mythic+ milestone season identifier, used to adjust stat scaling
      for seasonal content and achievements.
  returns: Returns a float representing the calculated expected stat value. The value
    is typically normalized to a meaningful unit based on the stat type and game context.
    Zero or negative values may indicate invalid parameters or no applicable scaling
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate health stat for level 60 warrior
    code: float health = db2Mgr.EvaluateExpectedStat(EXPECTED_STAT_HEALTH, 60, 0,
      0, 1, -1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate attack power for level 80 death knight in Shadowlands expansion
    code: float ap = db2Mgr.EvaluateExpectedStat(EXPECTED_STAT_ATTACK_POWER, 80, 8,
      12345, 6, 2);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on internal DB2 data structures and assumes valid
    parameter ranges. The implementation likely uses lookup tables or interpolation
    algorithms to compute stat values based on the provided parameters. Performance
    is generally good for single calls but may become significant if used in high-frequency
    loops.
  warnings: Invalid parameter combinations may result in unexpected or zero return
    values. Ensure that contentTuningId and expansion IDs match valid entries in the
    DB2 files, otherwise behavior is undefined. Using negative unitClass values might
    lead to incorrect stat calculations for special NPCs.
