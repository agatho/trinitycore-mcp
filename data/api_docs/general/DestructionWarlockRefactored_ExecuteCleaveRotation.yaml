  method: ExecuteCleaveRotation
  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::ExecuteCleaveRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the cleave rotation for a Destruction warlock, targeting multiple
    enemies within range.
  description: The ExecuteCleaveRotation method implements the core logic for a Destruction
    warlock's cleave ability, which allows the warlock to damage multiple nearby targets
    in a cone-shaped area. This method is typically called during combat when the
    warlock has multiple enemies within range and wishes to apply their destructive
    abilities efficiently. The implementation considers factors such as target positioning,
    spell cooldowns, and resource management to determine optimal casting order. It
    may also integrate with the warlock's AI decision-making system to prioritize
    targets based on threat level or damage potential.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or GUID for the
      primary cleave target. This parameter is used to identify which enemy to begin
      the cleave rotation against, and may be updated during execution to reflect
      changing target priorities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleave Rotation Execution
    code: 'int primaryTarget = 12345;

      warlock->ExecuteCleaveRotation(&primaryTarget);

      // Executes the cleave rotation targeting enemy with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cleave Rotation with Dynamic Target Selection
    code: 'int currentTarget = player->GetSelectedUnit()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      warlock->ExecuteCleaveRotation(&currentTarget);

      // Executes cleave rotation on the currently selected unit, potentially targeting
      additional nearby enemies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the warlock has sufficient mana and that the necessary
    spells are available for casting. The implementation may include checks for line
    of sight and target validity before executing any cleave abilities. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary spell casts when targets are not within
    optimal range or when cooldowns are active.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to incorrect targeting
    behavior or crashes if the referenced memory is invalid. Ensure that the target
    pointer points to a valid unit before calling this method, especially in multi-threaded
    environments where target changes might occur concurrently.
