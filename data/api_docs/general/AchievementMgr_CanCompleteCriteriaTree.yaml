documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a criteria tree can be completed based on current player
    progress
  description: The CanCompleteCriteriaTree method evaluates whether all criteria within
    a given achievement criteria tree have been met by the player. This method is
    used internally by the achievement system to determine if an achievement should
    be awarded or if a player has reached the completion state for a specific criteria
    tree. It checks against the player's current progress, achievements, and related
    conditions to make this determination. The method typically returns true when
    all required criteria are satisfied and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all criteria in the specified criteria tree have been completed
    by the player, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the achievement
    associated with this criteria tree can be awarded to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Criteria Tree is Complete
    code: "if (achievementMgr->CanCompleteCriteriaTree(criteriaTree)) {\n    // Award\
      \ achievement or perform related action\n    player->CompletedAchievement(achievementId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the player's achievement
    progress, including tracking of completed criteria, time-based conditions, and
    other relevant game state information. It may be called frequently during achievement
    evaluation processes.
  warnings: This method should only be called when evaluating whether an achievement
    can be awarded. Calling it inappropriately during gameplay could lead to incorrect
    achievement states or performance issues.
