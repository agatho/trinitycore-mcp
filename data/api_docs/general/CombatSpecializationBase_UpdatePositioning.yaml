  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: UpdatePositioning
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdatePositioning(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positioning of a combat specialization unit relative to its target.
  description: The UpdatePositioning method adjusts the positioning logic for a combat
    specialization unit, typically used in AI behavior to maintain optimal distance
    and orientation toward a target. This method is crucial for ensuring that units
    follow proper combat positioning strategies, such as maintaining melee range or
    positioning for ranged attacks. It may involve calculations based on unit movement,
    target position, and combat state to determine the most effective positioning
    strategy. The method is generally called during combat updates or when target
    changes occur.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the current combat target.
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing unit, otherwise the behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "void MyCombatAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        m_combatSpecialization->UpdatePositioning(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during combat updates and
    may influence movement behavior, attack timing, or positioning decisions. It's
    important to ensure that the target unit remains valid when this method is called.
  warnings: Calling UpdatePositioning with a null or invalid target pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the validity of the target before
    invoking this method.
