  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: SetAuctionProfile
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetAuctionProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const
    ProfessionAuctionProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the auction profile for a player's profession.
  description: The SetAuctionProfile method updates or initializes the auction profile
    associated with a player's profession in the TrinityCore auction system. This
    profile typically contains settings related to how the player's auction items
    are managed, such as bid thresholds, listing durations, and other auction behavior
    preferences. The method is used internally by the auction house system to ensure
    that each player's profession-specific auction settings are correctly applied
    when they list items or participate in auctions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction profile
      is being set. This value must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  - name: profile
    description: A const reference to the ProfessionAuctionProfile object containing
      the auction settings for the player's profession. This includes parameters like
      bid settings, item categories, and listing preferences.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Auction Profile

      profile.listingDuration = 3600;

      bridge.SetAuctionProfile(12345, profile);'
