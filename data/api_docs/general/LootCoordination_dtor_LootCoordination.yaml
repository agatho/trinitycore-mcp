documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootCoordination object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LootCoordination class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures related to loot distribution coordination
    among players in a group or raid. The destructor ensures that no dangling pointers
    or memory leaks occur when the LootCoordination instance goes out of scope. It
    is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object is destroyed, typically
    at the end of its scope or when explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LootCoordination object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LootCoordination coordination;\n    // ...\
      \ use coordination ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes if any exist. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless explicitly managing object lifetime through placement new/delete patterns.
