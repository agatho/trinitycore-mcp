documentation:
  brief: Sets the leader GUID for a LFG group
  description: The SetLeader method assigns a new leader to a Looking For Group (LFG)
    group by updating the internal leader GUID stored within the LfgGroupData object.
    This method is typically used during group creation, leader transfers, or when
    a new leader needs to be designated for a dungeon or raid group. The GUID parameter
    should correspond to a valid player in the game world. This method does not perform
    any validation on the provided GUID and assumes it represents a legitimate player
    character.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become
      the new leader of the LFG group. This should be a valid player GUID from the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a New Group Leader
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.SetLeader(123456); // Sets player with GUID 123456 as the new leader'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transfer Leadership in a LFG Group
    code: "LfgGroupData* group = sLFGMgr->GetGroupByGuid(789012);\nif (group)\n{\n\
      \    group->SetLeader(345678); // Transfer leadership to player with GUID 345678\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the LfgGroupData object.
    It's important to ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual player
    who is currently in the group or available to join it. The method does not trigger
    any game events or send notifications to players; additional logic may be required
    to inform players about the leadership change.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or inconsistencies within the LFG system. Ensure that the GUID
    represents a valid player character before calling this method. This method should
    not be called during critical group operations without proper synchronization.
