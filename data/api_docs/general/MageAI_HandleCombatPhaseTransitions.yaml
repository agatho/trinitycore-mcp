documentation:
  brief: Manages and transitions between different combat phases for a Mage AI instance.
  description: The HandleCombatPhaseTransitions method is responsible for managing
    the state changes and behavior adjustments of a Mage AI during combat encounters.
    It evaluates current combat conditions, player positioning, threat levels, and
    spell availability to determine appropriate transitions between various combat
    phases such as melee engagement, ranged spellcasting, defensive stances, or retreat
    behaviors. This method ensures that the Mage AI adapts its tactical approach dynamically
    based on evolving battlefield conditions and enemy actions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler() {\n    MageAI* mageAI = GetMageAI();\n    mageAI->HandleCombatPhaseTransitions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the broader AI state machine and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. It may depend on internal AI flags,
    target information, and spell cooldowns to make decisions about phase transitions.
