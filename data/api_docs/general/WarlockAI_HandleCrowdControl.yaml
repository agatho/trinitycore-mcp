  class: WarlockAI
  method: HandleCrowdControl
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HandleCrowdControl(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to apply a crowd control effect on the specified target unit.
  description: The HandleCrowdControl method is responsible for managing the application
    of crowd control abilities within the WarlockAI class. This method evaluates whether
    a suitable crowd control spell can be cast on the provided target unit, taking
    into account factors such as target validity, spell availability, mana requirements,
    and existing debuffs. It serves as a core component in the AI's combat decision-making
    process for controlling enemy movement and actions during encounters. The method
    returns true if a successful crowd control application occurs, or false if the
    operation fails due to various constraints or conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be subjected to crowd control
      effects. Must be a valid target with appropriate combat state and line of sight.
  returns: Returns true if a crowd control effect was successfully applied to the
    target unit, false otherwise. Failure conditions include invalid target, insufficient
    mana, existing debuffs, or unavailability of applicable spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (warlockAI->HandleCrowdControl(targetUnit)) {\n    // Crowd control\
      \ successfully applied\n    // Continue with other actions\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Failed to apply crowd control\n    // Consider alternative tactics\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Selection Logic
    code: "Unit* target = SelectBestTarget();\nif (target && target->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n    if (warlockAI->HandleCrowdControl(target)) {\n        // Successfully\
      \ controlled the target\n        // Proceed with follow-up actions\n       \
      \ DoNextAction();\n    } else {\n        // Try alternative spell or strategy\n\
      \        CastDoom();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI's update cycle when targeting
    and combat decisions are made. It relies on the AI's internal spell selection
    logic to determine which crowd control ability should be used. The method may
    perform checks for target validity, spell cooldowns, and resource availability
    before attempting to cast.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid null pointer exceptions. Be aware that frequent calls to this method
    without proper cooldown management may lead to inefficient AI behavior or resource
    waste.
