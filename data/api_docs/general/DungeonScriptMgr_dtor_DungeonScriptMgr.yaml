documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DungeonScriptMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~DungeonScriptMgr destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the DungeonScriptMgr class.
    This includes releasing any script instances, clearing internal data structures,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when a DungeonScriptMgr object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of dungeon-related scripts and their
    associated data to maintain game stability and prevent resource exhaustion.

  - title: Automatic destruction of DungeonScriptMgr
    code: "void CleanupDungeonScripts()\n{\n    // DungeonScriptMgr is automatically\
      \ destroyed when it goes out of scope\n    {\n        DungeonScriptMgr mgr;\n\
      \        // ... use mgr ...\n    } // mgr destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. The destruction process is handled automatically by the C++ runtime
    when objects go out of scope or are deleted. It's important to ensure that no
    other components hold references to scripts managed by this instance during destruction.
