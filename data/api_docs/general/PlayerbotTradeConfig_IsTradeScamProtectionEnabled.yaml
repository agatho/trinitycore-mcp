documentation:
  brief: Determines whether trade scam protection is enabled for player bots.
  description: This method checks the configuration state to determine if trade scam
    protection is active for player bots within the TrinityCore framework. Trade scam
    protection helps prevent bots from engaging in fraudulent trading behaviors such
    as offering items with no value or attempting to exploit trading mechanics. The
    method returns a boolean value indicating the current protection status, which
    can be used by other systems to enforce or disable trading safeguards based on
    the configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if trade scam protection is enabled for player bots; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Trade Scam Protection is Enabled
    code: "if (playerbotTradeConfig.IsTradeScamProtectionEnabled()) {\n    // Enable\
      \ additional validation for trades\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Trade scam\
      \ protection is enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with standard trading\
      \ behavior\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Trade scam protection is disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration file or in-memory settings
    structure that controls bot behavior. It's important to note that enabling this
    feature may slightly increase CPU usage due to additional validation checks during
    trade operations.
