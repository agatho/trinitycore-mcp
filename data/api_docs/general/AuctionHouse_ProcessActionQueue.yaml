api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ProcessActionQueue
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ProcessActionQueue(int * player, AuctionSession &
    session)
documentation:
  brief: Processes queued auction actions for a player session within the auction
    house system.
  description: The ProcessActionQueue method handles all pending auction-related operations
    for a given player session. It typically processes actions such as placing bids,
    listing items, or canceling auctions that have been queued for execution. This
    method ensures proper synchronization and validation of auction transactions before
    applying them to the auction house database. The function operates within the
    context of an AuctionSession, which maintains state information about the current
    player's interaction with the auction house. It is designed to be called periodically
    or upon specific events to maintain consistency between client requests and server-side
    auction data.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This value identifies which player's auction actions are being processed.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object containing the state and queued
      actions for a specific player's auction interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Assume session has been populated with queued actions

      auctionHouse->ProcessActionQueue(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Session Management
    code: "void HandlePlayerAuctionActions(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetSession())\n\
      \    {\n        int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n        AuctionSession&\
      \ session = player->GetSession()->GetAuctionSession();\n        auctionHouse->ProcessActionQueue(&playerId,\
      \ session);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the game loop or when a player's
    auction session is being finalized. It's crucial that the player pointer and session
    are valid to prevent undefined behavior. The method may perform database operations,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account for high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID is valid and that the AuctionSession contains
    properly validated queued actions before calling this method. Passing invalid
    pointers or corrupted session data can lead to crashes or inconsistent auction
    state.
