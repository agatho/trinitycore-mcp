documentation:
  brief: Called when the world boss AI engages with a target, initiating combat behavior.
  description: The _JustEngagedWith method is a virtual callback function in the WorldBossAI
    class that is invoked whenever the boss creature begins combat with a target.
    This method serves as the primary entry point for initiating boss-specific combat
    behaviors and AI logic. It is typically called by the core game engine when the
    boss's aggro state changes, triggering the start of combat animations, sound effects,
    and custom AI routines defined in derived classes. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no direct return operations, but it may trigger other
    internal methods or events that control the boss's behavior during the engagement
    phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyWorldBossAI : public WorldBossAI {\npublic:\n    void _JustEngagedWith()\
      \ override {\n        // Custom combat initialization\n        Talk(SAY_AGGRO);\n\
      \        // Start boss-specific abilities\n        DoCast(SPELL_ENRAGE);\n \
      \       WorldBossAI::_JustEngagedWith();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should be overridden in custom
    boss AI implementations. It's typically called from within the core combat system
    when a boss enters combat state, so it's important to ensure proper initialization
    of any custom behavior before calling the base implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal mechanics
    of the AI system. Improper handling may lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent
    combat states. Always call the base class implementation if you override this
    method.
