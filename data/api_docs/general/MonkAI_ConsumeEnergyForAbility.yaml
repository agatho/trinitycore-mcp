  class: MonkAI
  method: ConsumeEnergyForAbility
  signature: void MonkAI::ConsumeEnergyForAbility(int spellId, int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes energy from the MonkAI's resource pool to execute a specified ability.
  description: The ConsumeEnergyForAbility method reduces the energy level of a MonkAI
    instance by a specified amount when performing an ability. This method is typically
    invoked during AI decision-making processes to ensure that abilities requiring
    energy (such as martial arts or healing techniques) can only be executed when
    sufficient energy resources are available. The method does not validate whether
    the requested energy amount is sufficient; it simply deducts the specified value
    from the current energy pool. Energy consumption is a core mechanic in Monk class
    gameplay, where abilities like Tiger Palm, Spinning Crane Kick, and various healing
    abilities require energy to be used.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability being consumed. This
      value determines which ability is being executed and may influence how energy
      is consumed or processed internally.
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of energy to deduct from the MonkAI's current resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer representing the energy cost of the ability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Consumption for Tiger Palm
    code: "void ApplyTigerPalm() {\n    int spellId = 100780; // Tiger Palm\n    int\
      \ energyCost = 20;\n    this->ConsumeEnergyForAbility(spellId, energyCost);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Energy Consumption
    code: "void ExecuteAbility(int spellId, int requiredEnergy) {\n    if (GetEnergy()\
      \ >= requiredEnergy) {\n        ConsumeEnergyForAbility(spellId, requiredEnergy);\n\
      \        // Proceed with ability execution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal energy state of the MonkAI. It
    is crucial that this method is called only after verifying that sufficient energy
    exists to avoid negative energy states. The implementation likely interacts with
    a resource management system in TrinityCore's AI framework.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for sufficient energy may result
    in negative energy values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in
    subsequent ability usage logic.
