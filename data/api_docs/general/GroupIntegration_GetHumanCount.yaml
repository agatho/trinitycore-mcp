  signature: uint32 GroupIntegration::GetHumanCount(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of human players in a specified group
  description: The GetHumanCount method iterates through all members of the provided
    Group object and returns the total count of players who are classified as human.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore server implementations
    to determine group composition for quest requirements, loot distribution rules,
    or player-based game mechanics that specifically target human characters. The
    method performs a simple loop over the group's members and checks each player's
    race against the human race ID (typically 1). It does not modify any group state
    and is safe for read-only operations.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose members will be counted. Must not
      be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of human players in the
    group. Returns 0 if no humans are present or if the group pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group composition
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    uint32 humanCount\
      \ = GroupIntegration::GetHumanCount(myGroup);\n    if (humanCount > 0)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Proceed with human-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in quest requirement validation
    code: "void ValidateQuestRequirement(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && GroupIntegration::GetHumanCount(group) >= 2)\n    {\n    \
      \    // Allow quest progression only if at least 2 humans are in the group\n\
      \        player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object passed to it is valid and properly
    initialized. The implementation relies on the player's race being correctly set
    in the database or during runtime. Performance impact is minimal as it only iterates
    through group members once.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the group parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always validate that the group exists before calling this method.
    Also, note that this method counts only players with race ID 1 (Human), so it
    may not be suitable for other racial checks without modification.
