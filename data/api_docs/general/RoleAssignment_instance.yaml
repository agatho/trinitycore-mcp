documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the RoleAssignment class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the RoleAssignment
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance. This method ensures
    that only one RoleAssignment object exists throughout the application lifecycle.
    The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid and should not be deleted by the
    caller. This design is commonly used in TrinityCore for managing role-based access
    control or assignment systems within the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of RoleAssignment. Never returns nullptr
    under normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleAssignment* roleAssign = RoleAssignment::instance();

      // Use roleAssign to access role assignment functionality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Role Assignment Methods
    code: "RoleAssignment* ra = RoleAssignment::instance();\nif (ra)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ role assignment operations\n    ra->AssignRole(player, \"GROUP_LEADER\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in TrinityCore's implementation as it uses a static
    local variable approach for singleton creation. The instance is created on first
    access and remains valid for the application lifetime.
