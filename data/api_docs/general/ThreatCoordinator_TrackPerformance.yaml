  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for a specified operation within the threat coordination
    system.
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing data for a given operation
    to monitor and analyze system performance. This method is typically used in the
    context of threat management systems where tracking execution times of various
    operations helps identify bottlenecks or optimize behavior. It accepts a duration
    measurement and an operation identifier, storing this information for potential
    later analysis or reporting. The method does not return any value but contributes
    to internal performance monitoring mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken to complete the operation, measured in microseconds.
      This value is used to track how long specific threat coordination tasks take
      to execute.
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier describing the type of operation being tracked.
      This helps categorize performance data for reporting or debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();

      // ... perform some threat coordination task ...

      auto end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();

      ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start), "UpdateAggroList");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other performance tracking
    utilities to build a comprehensive view of system efficiency. It's designed for
    low-overhead logging and may be disabled in production builds for performance
    reasons.
