  class: BossAI
  method: CanAIAttack
  signature: bool BossAI::CanAIAttack(const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the boss AI can initiate an attack against a specified
    target.
  description: The CanAIAttack method evaluates if the current boss AI instance is
    capable of launching an attack on a given target. This check typically considers
    factors such as the target's validity, the AI's current state, and whether the
    attack would be appropriate based on game mechanics. It is commonly used within
    the BossAI framework to prevent invalid or premature attacks during combat phases.
    The method ensures that the AI respects combat rules and does not attempt actions
    that would break game logic or cause instability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier. This
      parameter is expected to be a valid pointer to an integer value, typically corresponding
      to a unit's GUID or similar identification mechanism used in TrinityCore.
  returns: Returns true if the AI can attack the specified target; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false may indicate that the target is invalid, the AI
    is in a state where attacking is not allowed, or other game logic constraints
    prevent the attack.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if boss can attack a target
    code: "if (bossAI->CanAIAttack(&targetGuid)) {\n    bossAI->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CanAIAttack in a custom AI behavior
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (CanAIAttack(&m_targetGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with attack logic\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Handle case where attack is not allowed\n        DoCast(SPELL_FLEE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core BossAI system and should be used carefully
    to avoid breaking combat flow. It's recommended to validate the target pointer
    before passing it to this function to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid target ID may lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the target parameter points to a valid,
    active unit before calling this method.
