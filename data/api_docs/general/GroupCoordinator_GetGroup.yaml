  method: GetGroup
  signature: Group * GroupCoordinator::GetGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Group object associated with the GroupCoordinator instance
  description: The GetGroup method returns a pointer to the Group object that the
    GroupCoordinator is managing. This method provides access to the group's data
    and functionality, including member information, group leader details, and group-specific
    settings. The returned Group pointer can be used to perform operations such as
    checking group composition, retrieving loot settings, or managing group invitations.
    It is important to note that this method may return a null pointer if no group
    has been assigned to the coordinator, which should be handled appropriately by
    calling code.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object managed by this GroupCoordinator instance,
    or nullptr if no group is currently associated with the coordinator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve and check group
    code: "Group* group = groupCoordinator->GetGroup();\nif (group != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform operations on the group\n    uint32 groupId = group->GetId();\n\
      \    // ... other group operations\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no\
      \ group is assigned\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"No group assigned\
      \ to coordinator\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally.
    If accessed from multiple threads, proper synchronization mechanisms should be
    implemented by the caller. The returned Group pointer remains valid only as long
    as the GroupCoordinator maintains a reference to that group.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the returned Group pointer.
    Accessing methods on a null Group pointer will result in undefined behavior and
    likely crash the server.
