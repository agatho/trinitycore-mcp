documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a unit entity in the game world.
  description: The IsUnit() method checks if the ObjectGuid instance refers to a unit
    object, such as a player, NPC, or pet. This method evaluates the type bits within
    the GUID to determine if it belongs to the unit category. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, GUIDs are structured with type identifiers that classify
    objects into different categories including units, items, game objects, and more.
    The method returns true if the GUID represents a unit-type object, and false otherwise.
    This check is commonly used in gameplay logic where operations need to be restricted
    or applied only to unit entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a unit (player, NPC, pet, etc.),
    false if it represents any other type of object such as an item, game object,
    or dynamic object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if GUID refers to a unit
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);\nif (guid.IsUnit())\
      \ {\n    // This will be true for player GUIDs\n    printf(\"GUID represents\
      \ a unit\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"GUID does not represent a unit\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsUnit() in combat logic
    code: "Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_player, m_targetGuid);\nif (m_targetGuid.IsUnit())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to proceed with unit-specific actions\n    DoCombatAction(target);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle non-unit targets appropriately\n    SendErrorMessage(\"\
      Target is not a unit\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid where type information
    is encoded in the higher-order bits. It's important to note that this check does
    not validate whether the actual object exists in the world, only that its GUID
    type indicates it should be a unit. Performance-wise, this is a fast bitwise operation
    with no significant overhead.
  warnings: Be cautious when using IsUnit() in performance-critical code paths as
    while the method itself is fast, calling it repeatedly without caching results
    may introduce unnecessary overhead. Also, remember that IsUnit() only checks the
    type of the GUID, not the existence or validity of the referenced object in memory.
