  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordCallbackLatency
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordCallbackLatency(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the latency of a callback in microseconds for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordCallbackLatency method is used to log the execution time
    of asynchronous callbacks within the bot system. This method is typically invoked
    by bot subsystems to track how long specific operations take, enabling performance
    analysis and optimization. The recorded latency data helps identify bottlenecks
    in bot behavior, particularly in event-driven systems where timing is critical
    for game responsiveness. The method accepts a single parameter representing the
    time taken in microseconds, which is then stored internally for statistical analysis
    or reporting purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The duration of the callback execution in microseconds. This value
      should be a positive integer representing the time elapsed since the start of
      the callback until its completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyBot::OnEvent() {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Perform some bot logic\n    DoSomething();\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    uint64 duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start).count();\n    performanceMonitor->RecordCallbackLatency(duration);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Callbacks
    code: "class BotPerformanceTracker {\npublic:\n    void TrackMultipleCallbacks()\
      \ {\n        auto start1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    \
      \    ProcessMovement();\n        auto end1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \        \n        auto start2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \        UpdateTarget();\n        auto end2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \        \n        performanceMonitor->RecordCallbackLatency(\n            std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end1\
      \ - start1).count());\n        performanceMonitor->RecordCallbackLatency(\n\
      \            std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end2 - start2).count());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within bot callback functions.
    It's recommended to use high-resolution timing functions like std::chrono::high_resolution_clock
    for accurate measurements. The internal storage mechanism may aggregate or average
    recorded values over time, so individual recordings might not reflect real-time
    performance data directly.
  warnings: Ensure that the microseconds parameter is always a positive value; negative
    values may cause unexpected behavior in the monitoring system. This method should
    not be called from interrupt contexts or high-frequency loops without considering
    potential performance impact on the monitoring system itself.
