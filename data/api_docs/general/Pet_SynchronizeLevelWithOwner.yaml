documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the pet's level to match that of its owner.
  description: The SynchronizeLevelWithOwner method updates a pet's current level
    to be identical to its owner's level. This ensures that the pet's stats, abilities,
    and experience progression remain aligned with the player's character level. The
    method is typically invoked when a player levels up or when a pet is summoned
    to maintain proper balance in gameplay mechanics. It does not affect the pet's
    experience points directly but modifies its effective level for stat calculations
    and ability availability.

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a player's level changes to ensure the
    pet remains properly leveled. It may trigger visual updates or stat recalculations
    internally within the TrinityCore framework.
