  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: SummonedCreatureDespawn
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDespawn(Creature * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the despawn event of a summoned creature within the SmartGameObjectAI
    framework.
  description: The SummonedCreatureDespawn method is invoked when a creature that
    was summoned by a SmartGameObjectAI instance is removed from the world. This typically
    occurs when the summoned creature's timer expires, is killed, or is explicitly
    dismissed. The method allows the AI to perform cleanup operations, update internal
    state, and potentially trigger other events or actions based on the creature's
    departure. It plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of summoned units
    within smart GameObject scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has been despawned. This parameter
      represents the specific summoned unit that triggered the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Smart AI Script
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDespawn(Creature* unit)\n{\n  \
      \  if (!unit)\n        return;\n\n    // Log the despawn event\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      smartai\", \"Summoned creature with entry %u has despawned.\", unit->GetEntry());\n\
      \n    // Perform any necessary cleanup or state updates\n    m_summonedCreatures.remove(unit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when a summoned creature leaves the world. Developers should ensure that any resources
    allocated for the summoned unit are properly released within this function to
    prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand its internal behavior
    and dependencies. Incorrect handling of the unit pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
