  signature: bool Bag::IsEmpty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bag contains no items.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if a Bag object has no items currently
    stored within it. This is a read-only operation that examines the internal item
    container of the bag and returns true if the count of items is zero, or false
    if there are one or more items present. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    bags are containers that hold items for players and NPCs, and this method provides
    a simple way to verify if a bag is empty before performing operations such as
    adding items or checking inventory status. The method does not modify the bag's
    contents or state in any way.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bag contains no items; returns false if the bag contains
    one or more items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player's bag is empty
    code: "if (playerBag->IsEmpty()) {\n    // Handle empty bag logic\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This bag is empty.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty in inventory management
    code: "for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_BAGS; ++i) {\n    if (PlayerBag* bag = player->GetBag(i))\
      \ {\n        if (bag->IsEmpty()) {\n            // Log or process empty bags\n\
      \            sLog->outString(\"Bag %u is empty.\", i);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count check on the bag's internal item list.
    It is optimized for performance and should not cause noticeable lag when called
    frequently. The method is thread-safe as long as no other threads are modifying
    the bag's contents during the call.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the immediate contents of the bag
    and does not account for any potential virtual or temporary items that might be
    displayed in the UI but not actually stored in the container. Also, if a bag is
    modified by another thread while this method is executing, the result may be inconsistent.
