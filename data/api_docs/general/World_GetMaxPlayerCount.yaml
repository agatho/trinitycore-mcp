  method: GetMaxPlayerCount
  signature: uint32 World::GetMaxPlayerCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of players allowed on the server
  description: The GetMaxPlayerCount method retrieves the configured maximum player
    limit for the World instance. This value represents the upper bound of concurrent
    players that can be connected to the server at any given time. The returned value
    is typically defined in the server configuration files and may be overridden by
    runtime settings or server-specific restrictions. This method is commonly used
    for server capacity monitoring, player count validation, and determining whether
    new players can be allowed to log in.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of players allowed on the
    server simultaneously
  examples:
  - title: Checking Server Capacity
    code: "uint32 maxPlayers = sWorld->GetMaxPlayerCount();\nuint32 currentPlayers\
      \ = sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount();\nif (currentPlayers >= maxPlayers)\n{\n\
      \    // Server is at capacity\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"Server is full. Please\
      \ try again later.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Player Limit Checking
    code: "void CheckPlayerLimit()\n{\n    uint32 maxPlayers = sWorld->GetMaxPlayerCount();\n\
      \    uint32 currentPlayers = sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount();\n    \n    if\
      \ (currentPlayers >= maxPlayers)\n    {\n        // Log server capacity reached\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Server at maximum player capacity: %u/%u\", currentPlayers,\
      \ maxPlayers);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        uint32 availableSpots = maxPlayers\
      \ - currentPlayers;\n        sLog->outString(\"Available player spots: %u\"\
      , availableSpots);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a static value that is set during server initialization
    and does not change during runtime unless explicitly modified through configuration
    updates. The value may be affected by server type configurations (e.g., PvP vs.
    PvE servers) or special server modes.
  warnings: The returned value represents the hard limit for player connections, but
    actual player count may vary due to pending logins, disconnects, or other transient
    conditions. This method does not account for players in transition states or those
    who are temporarily disconnected.
