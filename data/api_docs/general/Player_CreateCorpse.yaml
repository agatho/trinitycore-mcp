  brief: Creates a corpse object for the player upon death
  description: The CreateCorpse method is responsible for generating and initializing
    a corpse object when a player dies in World of Warcraft. This method handles the
    creation of the corpse's visual representation, sets up the necessary data structures,
    and ensures that the corpse persists in the game world until it is looted or despawns.
    The method typically gets called automatically by the game engine during the death
    sequence, but can also be invoked manually in certain circumstances such as custom
    death mechanics or debugging scenarios. It manages the corpse's position, orientation,
    and associated loot information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the newly created Corpse object if successful, or
    nullptr if the corpse creation fails due to invalid state or memory allocation
    issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse creation during player death
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... other death handling code ...\n\
      \    Corpse* corpse = this->CreateCorpse();\n    if (corpse)\n    {\n      \
      \  // Corpse successfully created\n        corpse->SetOwnerGUID(this->GetGUID());\n\
      \        // ... additional corpse setup ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game engine during
    player death processing. The returned Corpse pointer should be checked for null
    before use, as corpse creation can fail under certain conditions such as invalid
    player state or server resource constraints. The corpse will automatically be
    removed from the world when it expires or is looted.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the full implications
    of creating a corpse outside of normal death mechanics. Improper use may lead
    to memory leaks, incorrect corpse positioning, or game state inconsistencies.
    Always ensure proper cleanup of corpse references after they are no longer needed.
