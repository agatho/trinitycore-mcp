documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads instance lock data from the database into memory for
    active instance management.
  description: The InstanceLockMgr::Load method is responsible for retrieving all
    existing instance lock records from the database and populating the internal data
    structures used by the instance lock manager. This method is typically called
    during server startup or when the instance lock system needs to be refreshed with
    current database state. It ensures that all active instance locks, including those
    related to raids, dungeons, and other grouped content, are properly loaded and
    managed in memory for real-time access and modification. The method performs necessary
    validation and error handling to maintain data integrity during the loading process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeInstanceLocks()\n{\n    sInstanceLockMgr->Load();\n\
      \    // Instance locks are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete refresh of instance lock data is required. It's not thread-safe and
    should be executed in a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions. The
    method may block briefly while reading from the database depending on the number
    of active instance locks.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing instance lock data
    is properly cleared before calling Load() to avoid inconsistent state.
