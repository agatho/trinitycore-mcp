documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest has a specific flag in the QuestFlagsEx2 field.
  description: This method determines whether a quest possesses a particular flag
    within the QuestFlagsEx2 field, which is used to define additional quest properties
    beyond the standard quest flags. It allows developers to verify specific quest
    characteristics such as whether a quest is flagged for PvP, has special requirements,
    or is part of a specific category. The method returns true if the specified flag
    is present in the quest's flagsEx2 field, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for implementing quest-related logic and filtering quests based on
    their extended properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has the specified QuestFlagsEx2 flag set, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if quest has PvP flag
    code: "if (quest->HasFlagEx2(QUEST_FLAG_EX2_PVP)) {\n    // Quest is flagged for\
      \ PvP\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for special quest flags
    code: "if (quest->HasFlagEx2(QUEST_FLAG_EX2_SPECIAL)) {\n    // Quest has special\
      \ requirements or properties\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other quest flag checking
    methods to determine quest eligibility and behavior. Performance considerations
    are minimal as it simply performs a bitwise operation on the flags field.
  warnings: The method assumes that the quest object is valid and properly initialized;
    calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid quest object may result in
    undefined behavior.
