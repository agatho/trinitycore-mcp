  class: GroupFormation
  method: UpdateFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::UpdateFormation(const int & centerPosition, float
    direction)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of a group based on the specified center position and
    direction.
  description: 'The UpdateFormation method adjusts the positioning of group members
    relative to a central point, using a given direction for orientation. This functionality
    is typically used in group-based gameplay mechanics such as raid formations, battlefield
    positioning, or coordinated mob movement. The method modifies internal group formation
    data to reflect the new center and directional parameters. It does not directly
    interact with player movement but rather updates the logical formation state that
    may be applied during subsequent movement operations. Precondition: The group
    must exist and have valid members; Postcondition: The group''s formation is updated
    to match the provided center position and direction.'
  parameters:
  - name: centerPosition
    description: An integer representing the index or identifier of the central position
      within the group. This determines which member serves as the anchor point for
      the formation.
  - name: direction
    description: A floating-point value indicating the direction in radians that the
      formation should face. Zero radians typically represents north, with positive
      values rotating clockwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Update
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      int center = 0;

      float direction = 1.57f; // 90 degrees in radians

      formation.UpdateFormation(center, direction);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Group Formation with Dynamic Direction
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nif (formation)\n\
      {\n    int centerIndex = player->GetGroup()->GetLeaderGuid().GetCounter();\n\
      \    float facingDirection = player->GetOrientation();\n    formation->UpdateFormation(centerIndex,\
      \ facingDirection);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal group data structures and may not
    immediately affect visual positioning of players. The actual application of the
    formation update depends on how the game engine handles movement logic. Performance-wise,
    this is a lightweight operation that only updates state information without complex
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the centerPosition parameter refers to a valid member within
    the group; otherwise, behavior may be undefined. Avoid calling this method during
    critical gameplay events where formation changes could conflict with ongoing actions.
