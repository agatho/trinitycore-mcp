documentation:
  brief: Clears all entries from the gossip menu, removing any previously added options.
  description: The ClearMenu method removes all existing gossip menu entries from
    the current menu instance. This method is typically used when rebuilding a gossip
    menu or resetting its contents before adding new options. It ensures that no stale
    or leftover menu items remain in the gossip interface. The operation is immediate
    and affects only the current GossipMenu object instance. This method is commonly
    called at the beginning of a gossip handler function to ensure a clean slate before
    populating the menu with relevant options based on player state or conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    // Clear\
      \ any existing menu entries\n    ClearMenu();\n    \n    // Add new options\n\
      \    AddMenuItem(0, 1, \"Buy items\", GOSSIP_OPTION_VENDOR);\n    AddMenuItem(0,\
      \ 2, \"Learn skills\", GOSSIP_OPTION_TRAIN);\n    \n    SendGossipMenu(1, creature->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not affect the underlying database or any persistent gossip
    data. It only clears the in-memory menu entries for the current interaction. The
    method is safe to call multiple times consecutively and will have no additional
    effect after the first call.
