  brief: Loads player traits from database configuration and entries results
  description: This method loads player traits data from the database, specifically
    handling configuration and entry results for trait systems. It processes the loaded
    data to initialize player trait information, including trait points and associated
    data structures. The method is typically called during player initialization or
    when loading saved character data from the database. This function handles the
    internal processing of trait-related data without requiring external parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadTraits(0, 0);

      // This would load trait data for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database queries and processing of trait-related
    data. The implementation may involve multiple database calls to retrieve trait
    information. Performance considerations include database query optimization and
    potential memory usage during trait loading.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's typically
    invoked internally during player initialization or loading process. Incorrect
    use could lead to incomplete trait data or corrupted player state.
