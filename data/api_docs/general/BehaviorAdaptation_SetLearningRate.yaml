  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SetLearningRate
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SetLearningRate(float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the learning rate for behavior adaptation in AI systems.
  description: The SetLearningRate method configures the rate at which an AI system
    adapts its behavior based on environmental feedback or training data. This parameter
    controls how quickly the AI adjusts its decision-making processes, with higher
    values leading to faster adaptation and potentially less stable behavior, while
    lower values result in slower but more consistent learning. The method is typically
    used within the context of NPC AI behavior trees or machine learning models integrated
    into TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: A floating-point value representing the learning rate. Values should
      generally be between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means no adaptation and 1.0 represents
      maximum adaptation speed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      behavior->SetLearningRate(0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Learning Rate Dynamically
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_isTrainingMode)\n        m_behaviorAdaptation->SetLearningRate(0.8f);\n\
      \    else\n        m_behaviorAdaptation->SetLearningRate(0.1f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal state of the BehaviorAdaptation
    object and should be called before starting any adaptive learning processes. It
    is recommended to test different learning rates in controlled environments to
    determine optimal performance for specific AI behaviors.
  warnings: Setting the learning rate too high may cause unstable or erratic behavior
    in AI systems, especially during initial training phases. Always validate that
    the provided rate value is within acceptable bounds before calling this method.
