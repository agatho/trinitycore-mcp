  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::DiscoverAvailableQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Discovers and assigns available quests to a player bot within the dynamic
    quest system.
  description: The DiscoverAvailableQuests method evaluates the current state of a
    player bot to determine which quests are eligible for discovery and assignment.
    It checks quest prerequisites, player level, faction requirements, and other conditional
    factors to identify quests that should be made available to the bot. This method
    is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots to dynamically
    populate the quest log with relevant content based on the bot's current progression
    and capabilities. The method returns a count of successfully discovered quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of quests successfully discovered and
    made available to the player bot. Returns zero if no quests are available or if
    an error occurs during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nint discoveredCount =\
      \ sDynamicQuestSystem->DiscoverAvailableQuests(bot);\nif (discoveredCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process newly discovered quests\n    sLog->outString(\"Discovered\
      \ %d new quests for the bot.\", discoveredCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest discovery logic of the dynamic quest
    system, which may be influenced by configuration settings and quest flags. It
    is recommended to call this method after any significant change in player state
    that could affect quest availability.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the bot's quest data
    or game context may lead to unexpected behavior or incomplete quest discovery.
    Ensure the player object is fully loaded before invoking this method.
