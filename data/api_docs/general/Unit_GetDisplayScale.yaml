  method: GetDisplayScale
  signature: float Unit::GetDisplayScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the display scale factor of the unit.
  description: The GetDisplayScale method retrieves the visual scale factor applied
    to the unit's model, which affects how large the unit appears in the game world.
    This scale is used for rendering purposes and can influence the unit's size relative
    to other units. The value returned represents a multiplier that determines the
    visual size of the unit's model, typically ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 depending
    on the unit type and configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the display scale factor applied to
    the unit's model. This scale factor is typically between 0.1 and 10.0, where values
    less than 1.0 indicate smaller visual representation, and values greater than
    1.0 indicate larger visual representation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float scale = unit->GetDisplayScale();\n// Use scale value for rendering\
      \ or calculations\nif (scale > 1.0f) {\n    // Unit appears larger than normal\n\
      }\nelse if (scale < 1.0f) {\n    // Unit appears smaller than normal\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for visual rendering and does not affect the
    unit's physical size or collision detection. The scale factor may vary based on
    unit type, race, class, or other game mechanics. It is important to note that
    this value is typically set during initialization or through specific game effects.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    scaling factors, as multiple sources of scaling can affect the final visual representation.
    This method may not reflect real-time changes in scale if the unit's model has
    been modified by external effects.
