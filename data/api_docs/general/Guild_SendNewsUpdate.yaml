documentation:
  brief: Sends guild news update information to the specified session.
  description: The SendNewsUpdate method is responsible for transmitting the latest
    guild news and updates to a connected player's session. This includes information
    such as guild achievements, member activity, and other relevant notifications
    that are part of the guild's public communication system within the World of Warcraft
    client. The method ensures that players receive timely updates about their guild's
    status and activities without requiring manual refreshes.

  examples:
  - title: Sending News Update to a Guild Member
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(12345);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n  \
      \  WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\n    myGuild->SendNewsUpdate(session);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player joins a guild or when new
    news items are added to the guild. It uses the WorldSession object to send data
    directly to the client, ensuring real-time updates. The implementation likely
    involves serializing guild news data into a packet format that the client can
    interpret.
