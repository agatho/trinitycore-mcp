  method: LoadTransportTemplates
  signature: void TransportMgr::LoadTransportTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all transport templates from the database into memory for use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadTransportTemplates method initializes and populates the transport
    system with data about various transports such as boats, zeppelins, and other
    moving objects that players can board. This method is typically called during
    server startup or map loading to ensure all transport definitions are available
    for spawning and managing transport entities in the game world. It reads transport
    templates from the database tables, processes them, and stores them internally
    for later use when creating actual transport GameObjects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeTransportSystem()\n{\n    sTransportMgr->LoadTransportTemplates();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup sequence before any
    maps are loaded. It's important to note that this method does not spawn actual
    transport GameObjects, but rather loads the template data needed for their creation.
    The method assumes database connections are already established and available.
  warnings: Calling this method after transports have already been spawned may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory leaks. This method should only be called during
    initialization phases of the server lifecycle.
