  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: ShouldBotInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptCoordinatorFixed::ShouldBotInterrupt(int botGuid, int &
    targetGuid, uint32 & spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should interrupt its current spell cast based on
    target and spell data.
  description: The ShouldBotInterrupt method evaluates if a bot character should interrupt
    its ongoing spell casting. It checks conditions related to the bot's GUID, the
    target GUID, and the spell ID being cast. This method is typically used in AI
    logic for managing spell priorities and interrupting casts when necessary, such
    as when a high-priority threat emerges or when a more effective spell becomes
    available. The method returns true if an interruption is recommended, false otherwise.
    It relies on internal state tracking of bot casting behavior and target information.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character that may need to
      interrupt its current spell cast.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the GUID of the
      target that triggered the potential interruption.
  - name: spellId
    description: Reference to a 32-bit unsigned integer that will be updated with
      the ID of the spell currently being cast by the bot.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should interrupt its current spell cast, false
    otherwise. The method updates targetGuid and spellId with relevant data if an
    interruption is advised.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (interruptCoordinator->ShouldBotInterrupt(botGuid, targetGuid, spellId))\
      \ {\n    // Perform interrupt logic\n    bot->InterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned values for decision making
    code: "int targetGuid = 0;\nuint32 spellId = 0;\nif (interruptCoordinator->ShouldBotInterrupt(botGuid,\
      \ targetGuid, spellId)) {\n    if (spellId == 12345) { // Example spell ID\n\
      \        // Handle specific spell interruption\n        bot->CastSpell(targetGuid,\
      \ 67890); // Cast alternative spell\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class which manages
    AI-based interrupt logic for bots in TrinityCore. It's designed to be called during
    bot AI update cycles where spell casting decisions are evaluated. The method assumes
    that the internal state of the bot and its target has been properly initialized
    before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid is valid before calling this method, as invalid GUIDs
    may lead to undefined behavior. Also, note that modifying targetGuid or spellId
    after receiving them from this method might affect subsequent AI decisions if
    not handled carefully.
