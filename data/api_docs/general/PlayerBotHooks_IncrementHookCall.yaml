  class: PlayerBotHooks
  method: IncrementHookCall
  signature: void PlayerBotHooks::IncrementHookCall(const char * hookName)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the call counter for a specified hook name within the PlayerBotHooks
    system.
  description: The IncrementHookCall method is used to track and increment the number
    of times a specific hook has been invoked within the PlayerBotHooks framework.
    This functionality is essential for monitoring bot behavior, debugging, and performance
    analysis in TrinityCore's player bot system. The method accepts a constant character
    pointer representing the name of the hook being tracked, and increases its internal
    call count by one. This mechanism allows developers to understand how frequently
    various hooks are triggered during bot operations, which can be useful for optimizing
    bot AI logic or identifying potential issues such as excessive hook calls that
    might impact performance.
  parameters:
  - name: hookName
    description: A constant character pointer specifying the name of the hook to increment.
      This string should uniquely identify a specific hook within the PlayerBotHooks
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hook Call Increment
    code: 'PlayerBotHooks::IncrementHookCall("OnUpdate");

      // Increments the call counter for the ''OnUpdate'' hook'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Hooks
    code: "void MyBotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    PlayerBotHooks::IncrementHookCall(\"OnUpdate\"\
      );\n    PlayerBotHooks::IncrementHookCall(\"OnCombatEnter\");\n    // ... bot\
      \ AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal monitoring system for player bots.
    It's important to note that hook names should be consistent and predefined to
    ensure accurate tracking. The implementation may use thread-safe mechanisms if
    multiple threads are involved in bot processing.
  warnings: Ensure that hookName strings are valid and not null to prevent undefined
    behavior. Repeated calls to this method without proper initialization of hook
    counters might lead to incorrect tracking data.
