  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetTotalDuration
  signature: int32 AreaTrigger::GetTotalDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total duration of the area trigger in milliseconds.
  description: The GetTotalDuration method retrieves the total lifetime duration of
    an AreaTrigger object, which represents a temporary visual and functional effect
    that lasts for a specified time period. This duration is typically set when the
    area trigger is created and defines how long the trigger will remain active before
    being destroyed. The returned value is expressed in milliseconds and corresponds
    to the initial duration configured for the trigger upon instantiation. This method
    is commonly used in spell effects, quest triggers, and other game mechanics that
    rely on timed area-based interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the total duration of the area trigger in milliseconds.
    A positive value indicates the remaining time before the trigger expires, while
    a zero or negative value may indicate an expired or invalid trigger state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Duration
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    int32 duration = trigger->GetTotalDuration();\n    if (duration > 0)\n\
      \        TC_LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Area trigger has %d ms remaining.\", duration);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Duration in Spell Logic
    code: "void SpellEffectAreaTrigger(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n{\n    AreaTrigger*\
      \ trigger = GetCaster()->GetAreaTrigger(GetSpellInfo()->Effects[effIndex].TriggerSpell);\n\
      \    if (trigger)\n    {\n        int32 totalDuration = trigger->GetTotalDuration();\n\
      \        // Use duration to determine effect strength or timing\n        int32\
      \ remainingTime = trigger->GetDuration();\n        // Apply logic based on time\
      \ remaining\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the original configured duration of the area trigger,
    not the current remaining time. For the actual remaining time, use GetDuration()
    instead. The returned value is typically set during the area trigger's creation
    and should remain constant throughout its lifetime unless modified by specific
    game mechanics.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the total initial duration, not the
    time remaining. If you need to know how much time is left before the trigger expires,
    use GetDuration() instead. Also, ensure the AreaTrigger pointer is valid before
    calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
