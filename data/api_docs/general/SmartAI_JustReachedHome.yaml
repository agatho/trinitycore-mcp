  method: JustReachedHome
  signature: void SmartAI::JustReachedHome()
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature using SmartAI reaches its home position after being
    moved or summoned.
  description: The JustReachedHome method is invoked in SmartAI when a creature successfully
    returns to its defined home position. This typically occurs after the creature
    has been moved via movement commands, summoned from another location, or has completed
    a path that leads back to its original spawn point. The method serves as a callback
    for custom AI behavior when the creature reaches its designated resting spot.
    It is commonly used to trigger events such as resetting the creature's state,
    initiating new behaviors, or performing actions specific to returning to the home
    location.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::JustReachedHome()\n{\n    // Reset creature's combat\
      \ state\n    me->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n    // Play a sound effect when\
      \ returning home\n    me->PlayDirectSound(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced State Management
    code: "void AdvancedCreatureAI::JustReachedHome()\n{\n    // Clear any ongoing\
      \ combat\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n        me->CombatStop();\n    \n    //\
      \ Reset to default AI behavior\n    me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_IMMUNE_TO_PC);\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger a quest event or spawn additional NPCs\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = me->GetMap()->GetPlayer(PlayerUniqueGuids[0]))\n        player->KilledMonsterCredit(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI framework and is automatically called
    by the core when a creature's movement path completes and it reaches its home
    position. It should not be manually invoked unless you are extending or overriding
    AI behavior. The method is typically used in conjunction with other SmartAI events
    to create complex creature behaviors.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI framework as it may
    cause unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure that any logic within this method
    does not block execution for extended periods, as it's part of the AI update cycle.
