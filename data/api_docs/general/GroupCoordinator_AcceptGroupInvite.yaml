  class: GroupCoordinator

  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::AcceptGroupInvite(Player * inviter)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts an invitation to join a group from another player
  description: The AcceptGroupInvite method handles the logic for accepting a group
    invitation sent by another player. It verifies that the inviting player is valid
    and that the inviter has a valid group. If successful, the method adds the current
    player to the group and updates the group's member list. This method typically
    gets called when a player clicks 'Accept' on a group invite received from another
    player in the game. The method returns true if the invitation was successfully
    accepted and added to the group, or false if there were issues such as invalid
    inviter, no existing group, or other group-related constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: inviter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the group invitation. Must
      be a valid player instance in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the group invitation was successfully accepted and the
    player was added to the group; returns false if the invitation could not be accepted
    due to invalid inviter, no existing group, or other group-related errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AcceptGroupInvite
    code: "Player* inviter = ...; // Assume this is a valid player\nif (groupCoordinator->AcceptGroupInvite(inviter))\
      \ {\n    // Player successfully joined the group\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_INVITE_ACCEPTED,\
      \ inviter->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Failed to accept group invite\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_INVITE_FAILED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already received a valid group invitation
    from the inviter. It does not handle sending or receiving invitations itself,
    but rather processes an existing invitation. The method should be called in the
    context of a player's interaction with the group system and must ensure thread
    safety when accessing shared group data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'inviter' parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent potential crashes or unexpected behavior. This method does not check
    if the inviter is already in the same group, so calling it multiple times with
    the same inviter may result in duplicate entries or undefined behavior.
