  class: Conversation
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: int Conversation::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with the conversation instance.
  description: The GetScriptId method returns an integer identifier that corresponds
    to the script assigned to this conversation. This ID is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to link conversation events and behaviors to specific script
    implementations. The returned value typically maps to a scripted handler defined
    in the game's scripting system, allowing for dynamic dialogue responses and quest
    progression based on scripted conditions. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call during active conversation processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the script ID associated with this conversation
    instance. A value of zero or negative may indicate an unassigned or invalid script
    ID, depending on the implementation details of the specific conversation handler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversationById(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    int scriptId = conv->GetScriptId();\n    if (scriptId > 0)\n    {\n \
      \       // Process conversation with the given script ID\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      scripts\", \"Conversation %u has script ID: %d\", conv->GetGUIDLow(), scriptId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with script registration systems
    to ensure that conversations are properly linked to their intended behavioral
    scripts. The returned ID should be validated against known script definitions
    to prevent runtime errors.
