  class: WorldObject
  method: GetCharmerOrOwnerOrOwnGUID
  signature: ObjectGuid WorldObject::GetCharmerOrOwnerOrOwnGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the charmer, owner, or own character.
  description: This method retrieves the GUID of the entity that controls or owns
    the current WorldObject. For creatures or player-controlled pets, this typically
    refers to the player who owns the creature or pet. For player-controlled summons,
    it returns the GUID of the player who summoned the creature. The method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine ownership relationships and can be crucial
    for proper handling of creature AI and player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the ObjectGuid of the charmer, owner, or own character. If no such
    entity exists, it returns an invalid GUID (0).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "WorldObject* target = ...;\nObjectGuid guid = target->GetCharmerOrOwnerOrOwnGUID();\n\
      if (guid != 0)\n{\n    // Handle the GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No owner or charmer\
      \ exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that require
    ownership information, such as GetCharmerOrOwnerOrOwnGUID() and related methods.
    It may return an invalid GUID if the WorldObject has no owner or charmer.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to unexpected
    behavior if the object is not properly owned or controlled by another entity.
    Also, ensure that the object is not a player-controlled summon before calling
    this method.
