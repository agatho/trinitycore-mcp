  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HandleCooldowns
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages and applies cooldowns for Demon Hunter abilities during AI combat.
  description: The HandleCooldowns method is responsible for managing the cooldown
    states of various Demon Hunter abilities within the AI system. It evaluates whether
    specific spells or abilities are ready to be used based on their cooldown timers
    and updates the internal state accordingly. This method typically integrates with
    the overall AI decision-making process to ensure that abilities are not cast before
    they are off cooldown, maintaining game balance and proper spell usage mechanics.
    The method may also handle synchronization of cooldowns with the target's state
    or environmental conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target identifier
      or index. Used to determine which target-specific cooldowns should be considered
      during processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandleCooldowns(&m_targetId);\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Casting Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::DoCastNextAbility()\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandleCooldowns(&m_targetId);\n    if (CanCastAbility(SpellId::VengefulSpirit))\n\
      \    {\n        DoCast(SpellId::VengefulSpirit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. It is recommended to call this method before any ability
    selection logic to ensure that only ready abilities are considered for casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and points to a valid target
    before calling this method, as invalid targets may lead to incorrect cooldown
    calculations or unexpected behavior.
