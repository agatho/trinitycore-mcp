documentation:
  brief: Updates all spawn groups within the instance based on current conditions
    and triggers.
  description: The UpdateSpawnGroups method is responsible for managing the dynamic
    spawning and despawning of game objects and creatures within an instance based
    on various conditions such as player presence, quest states, or event triggers.
    This method ensures that the correct entities are spawned or removed from the
    world at appropriate times, maintaining the intended gameplay experience and avoiding
    unnecessary resource consumption. It typically gets called during key moments
    like instance initialization, player entry, or when specific in-game events occur.
    The implementation may involve checking spawn group configurations, evaluating
    conditions, and invoking appropriate spawning/despawning logic.

  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Script
    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnPlayerEnter(Player* player) override\n    {\n        // Update spawn groups\
      \ when player enters\n        UpdateSpawnGroups();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggered by Event Completion
    code: "void ExampleInstanceScript::OnEventComplete(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    if\
      \ (eventId == 12345)\n    {\n        // Update spawn groups after event completion\n\
      \        UpdateSpawnGroups();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core framework during
    important instance transitions. Developers should ensure that spawn group configurations
    are properly defined in the database before calling this method. The method may
    perform multiple operations including spawning, despawning, and updating existing
    entities.
  warnings: Calling UpdateSpawnGroups manually without proper context may lead to
    unexpected behavior or resource leaks. Avoid calling it in tight loops or during
    critical sections where performance is important. Ensure that all spawn group
    conditions are properly validated before execution.
