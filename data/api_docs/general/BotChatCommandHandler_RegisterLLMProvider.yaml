documentation:
  brief: Registers a new LLM provider for use in bot chat commands.
  description: The RegisterLLMProvider method allows developers to register a new
    Large Language Model (LLM) provider that can be used by the BotChatCommandHandler
    to generate responses or process natural language input from players. This method
    takes ownership of the provided shared pointer to the LLM provider, enabling the
    chat command handler to utilize the registered provider for AI-driven interactions
    within the game environment. The registration is typically performed during initialization
    or configuration phases of the bot system.
  parameters:
  - name: provider
    description: A shared pointer to an LLMProvider instance that will be registered
      with the BotChatCommandHandler. This provider must implement the necessary interface
      for processing chat messages and generating AI responses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration of an LLM Provider
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<LLMProvider> myProvider = std::make_shared<MyCustomLLMProvider>();

      botChatHandler.RegisterLLMProvider(myProvider);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the LLM provider is fully initialized and ready to
    process requests. It's recommended to validate the provider before registration
    to avoid runtime errors. The BotChatCommandHandler may store multiple registered
    providers, allowing for dynamic selection based on context or configuration.
