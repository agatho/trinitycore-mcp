  signature: int QuestSelectionStrategy::SelectQuestPath(const int & available, Player
    * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects the optimal quest path for a bot player based on available quest
    options.
  description: The SelectQuestPath method determines the most appropriate quest path
    for a bot player by evaluating available quest options and selecting the one that
    best aligns with the bot's current state, objectives, and questing strategy. This
    method is typically used within the AI decision-making process to guide bot players
    through quest chains efficiently. It considers factors such as quest availability,
    player level, quest prerequisites, and strategic importance. The method returns
    an identifier representing the chosen quest path, which can be used to initiate
    or continue quest progression for the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: available
    description: An integer representing the set of available quest options for the
      bot to choose from. This value typically encodes multiple quest identifiers
      or flags that indicate which quests are currently accessible to the player.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for
      which the quest path is being selected. The method uses this player's state,
      level, and quest data to make the selection decision.
  returns: An integer identifier representing the selected quest path. This value
    corresponds to a specific quest or quest chain option chosen by the AI strategy.
    A return value of -1 typically indicates no valid quest path was found or an error
    occurred during selection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Path Selection
    code: "int selectedPath = strategy.SelectQuestPath(availableQuests, botPlayer);\n\
      if (selectedPath != -1) {\n    // Proceed with the selected quest path\n   \
      \ botPlayer->GetQuestStatus(selectedPath);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating with Bot Quest Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestSelection() {\n    int available = GetAvailableQuests();\n\
      \    Player* bot = GetBot();\n    int path = questStrategy.SelectQuestPath(available,\
      \ bot);\n    if (path > 0) {\n        // Initiate quest progression\n      \
      \  bot->SetCurrentQuest(path);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the available parameter contains valid quest identifiers
    and that the bot player object is properly initialized. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific quest selection strategy being used. This method
    is part of a larger AI framework designed to automate quest progression for bot
    players in World of Warcraft.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'available' parameter correctly encodes all valid quest
    options; otherwise, the method may return invalid results or fail to select an
    appropriate path. The method does not validate whether the selected quest path
    is actually completable by the bot's current level or resources.
