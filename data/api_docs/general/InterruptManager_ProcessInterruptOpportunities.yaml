  class: InterruptManager
  method: ProcessInterruptOpportunities
  signature: void InterruptManager::ProcessInterruptOpportunities()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all available interrupt opportunities for units in the world.
  description: The ProcessInterruptOpportunities method evaluates and handles all
    potential interrupt scenarios for active units within the game world. It checks
    for conditions that would allow one unit to interrupt another's spell casting,
    such as being hit by damage or receiving certain types of attacks. This method
    is typically invoked during combat updates or when spell casting states change.
    The implementation ensures proper handling of interrupt mechanics according to
    World of Warcraft's rules, including checking for valid interrupt sources, cooldowns,
    and targeting restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatSystem::Update()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n   \
      \ sInterruptManager->ProcessInterruptOpportunities();\n    // ... rest of update\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the core game loop or during combat
    state updates. It may have performance implications if invoked too frequently
    without proper throttling. The method operates on all active units in the world,
    so it's important to ensure that the calling context is appropriate for global
    processing.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate game update contexts may lead
    to inconsistent interrupt behavior or unexpected spell interruptions. Ensure that
    any custom logic using this method properly accounts for unit states and prevents
    unnecessary processing.
