  signature: void AuraEffect::HandlePreventResurrection(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the resurrection prevention effect of an aura.
  description: The HandlePreventResurrection method is responsible for managing the
    application and removal of auras that prevent players from being resurrected.
    This method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events to
    modify the player's ability to receive resurrection effects. It interacts with
    the AuraApplication object to determine the context of the aura state change and
    applies the appropriate game mechanics logic to either enable or disable resurrection
    prevention for the affected unit.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura is triggering
      the handler.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating how
      the effect should be processed (e.g., application, removal, or update).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, prevents resurrection; when false, allows it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Resurrection Prevention Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandlePreventResurrection(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Resurrection Prevention Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandlePreventResurrection(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's resurrection state and should be
    used carefully in conjunction with proper aura management. It is part of the core
    aura handling system and interacts with the game's resurrection mechanics to prevent
    players from being resurrected under certain conditions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior in player
    resurrection mechanics, potentially causing players to become stuck or unable
    to receive resurrection effects when they should be able to.
