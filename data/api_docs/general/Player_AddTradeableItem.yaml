  brief: Adds a tradeable item to the player's inventory
  description: This method adds a tradeable item to the player's inventory, making
    it available for trading. The item must be in a valid state for trading, meaning
    it should not be bound to account or guild, and should be in a condition that
    allows it to be traded. This method is typically used during the process of creating
    items that can be traded between players, such as when crafting or looting items
    that are meant to be tradeable.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = Item::CreateItem(12345, player);

      player->AddTradeableItem(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory management
    functions. It should be noted that the item must already be in a valid state for
    trading before calling this method, otherwise it may not be properly added to
    the player's inventory.
  warnings: This method does not validate if the item is actually tradeable; developers
    must ensure that the item meets all conditions required for trading before calling
    this method.
