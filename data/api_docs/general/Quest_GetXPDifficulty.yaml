documentation:
  brief: Returns the experience points difficulty level for a quest
  description: This method retrieves the XP difficulty value associated with a quest,
    which determines how much experience points a player will receive when completing
    the quest. The value is typically used to calculate the base experience reward
    and is based on the quest's level difference relative to the player's level. This
    method is essential for determining quest rewards and balancing game progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the experience points difficulty level, which
    corresponds to the quest's XP reward multiplier or base experience value used
    in calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 xpDifficulty = quest->GetXPDifficulty();

      int32 expReward = (int32)xpDifficulty * 100;

      printf("Quest XP difficulty: %u\n", xpDifficulty);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore core to calculate
    quest rewards and should not be called directly in most cases. The value returned
    represents the base experience points difficulty level, which may vary based on
    quest level and player level differences.
  warnings: The return value may be zero for quests that do not provide experience
    points or are invalid. Always check if the quest is valid before calling this
    method.
