  method: playerLink
  signature: int ChatHandler::playerLink(const int & name) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player associated with the given
    name.
  description: The playerLink method retrieves the globally unique identifier (GUID)
    for a player character based on their in-game name. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore server's chat handler system to resolve player names to
    their corresponding GUIDs for various administrative or game logic operations.
    The method operates within the context of the ChatHandler class, which manages
    command-line and in-game chat interactions. It assumes that the player name exists
    in the database and is accessible through the current session or world state.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The name of the player to look up. This should be a valid, existing
      character name in the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the specified player. If no
    player with the given name is found, the method may return 0 or throw an exception
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player GUID by Name
    code: "int playerId = handler->playerLink(\"JohnDoe\");\nif (playerId > 0) {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Player GUID: \" << playerId << std::endl;\n} else {\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"Player not found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal player database lookup mechanism and may
    involve database queries. Performance can be affected if there are many concurrent
    lookups or if the database is under heavy load. The method should only be called
    when a valid ChatHandler instance exists and the player name is known to be valid.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player name may result
    in undefined behavior or return values that do not represent a real player. Always
    validate input before calling this method, especially in user-facing command implementations.
