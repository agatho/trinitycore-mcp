documentation:
  brief: Clears all loaded conditions from the ConditionMgr instance.
  description: The Clean method removes and deallocates all condition entries that
    have been previously loaded into the ConditionMgr. This operation is typically
    invoked during server shutdown or when reloading condition data to ensure no stale
    or duplicate conditions remain in memory. The method ensures that all internal
    condition structures are properly reset, preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    consistency of the condition system. It does not take any parameters and performs
    no return value operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void OnServerShutdown()\n{\n    sConditionMgr->Clean();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to clear all conditions,
    such as during server shutdown or data reloads. Improper use may lead to dangling
    references in systems that depend on condition checks.
