  signature: void WorldSession::SendShowMailBox(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the client to display the mailbox interface for the specified
    player GUID.
  description: The SendShowMailBox method is used to instruct the client to open and
    display the mailbox interface for a specific player. This method is typically
    invoked when a player interacts with a mailbox object or when the game system
    needs to prompt the player to check their mail. The method takes a single parameter
    representing the GUID of the player whose mailbox should be shown. It does not
    return any value but sends a network packet to the client's session, triggering
    the visual display of the mailbox UI. This functionality is part of the core World
    of Warcraft communication protocol and relies on proper session management within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose mailbox interface
      should be displayed. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      world, otherwise the client may not display the mailbox correctly or could show
      an error.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SendShowMailBox(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Mailbox Interaction
    code: "void Player::OnMailboxInteract(GameObject* mailbox)\n{\n    if (GetSession())\n\
      \    {\n        GetSession()->SendShowMailBox(GetGUID().GetCounter());\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within game logic that handles player
    interactions with mailbox objects. It's important to ensure that the GUID passed
    is valid and corresponds to an actual player in the world, as invalid GUIDs may
    cause client-side issues or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid session or with an invalid GUID can
    result in client-side errors or undefined behavior. Always verify that the player's
    session exists before calling this method.
