  class: LeaderChangedHandler
  method: GetSubscribedEvents
  signature: int LeaderChangedHandler::GetSubscribedEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to for leader change
    notifications
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method returns an integer bitmask representing
    the event types that this LeaderChangedHandler instance is configured to handle.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this method is typically
    used in AI systems and event-driven architectures where objects need to register
    interest in specific game events. The returned value is usually a combination
    of predefined event flags that indicate which leader change scenarios this handler
    should respond to, such as when a group leader is promoted, demoted, or removed
    from a group. This method is essential for proper event routing within the game's
    event system and ensures that only relevant handlers are notified of specific
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask where each bit represents a specific event type. The
    exact meaning of bits depends on the predefined event constants used by the TrinityCore
    framework, typically including values like EVENT_GROUP_LEADER_CHANGED, EVENT_GROUP_LEADER_PROMOTED,
    or similar group-related events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check subscribed events
    code: "LeaderChangedHandler handler;\nint subscribedEvents = handler.GetSubscribedEvents();\n\
      if (subscribedEvents & EVENT_GROUP_LEADER_CHANGED)\n{\n    // Handle leader\
      \ change event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during event system initialization or when
    registering handlers with the game's event manager. The returned bitmask should
    be compared against predefined constants using bitwise operations to determine
    which specific events are subscribed to.
