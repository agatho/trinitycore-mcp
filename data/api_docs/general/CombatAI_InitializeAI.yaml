documentation:
  brief: Initializes the combat AI behavior for a creature or unit
  description: The InitializeAI method sets up the initial state and configuration
    for a CombatAI instance. This method is typically called during the creation or
    activation of an AI-controlled unit, such as a mob or NPC, to prepare it for combat
    behavior. It establishes the AI's internal data structures, registers necessary
    callbacks, and configures default combat parameters. The method ensures that the
    AI system is properly initialized before any combat-related logic begins executing.

  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "void OnCreatureCreate(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature->GetAI())\n\
      \        creature->GetAI()->InitializeAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's lifecycle. It is typically
    invoked automatically by the core when an AI is assigned to a unit, but may also
    be manually called in custom AI implementations. The initialization process includes
    setting up threat lists, defining combat priorities, and preparing the AI for
    engagement with targets.
