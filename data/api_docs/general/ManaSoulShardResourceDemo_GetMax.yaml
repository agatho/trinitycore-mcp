documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum mana soul shard resource value for the player
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of mana soul shards that
    can be accumulated by a player. This value represents the cap on the resource
    and is typically determined by the player's class, level, and any applicable buffs
    or gear effects. The returned value is used internally by the game engine to manage
    resource tracking and prevent overflow conditions. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of mana soul shards that
    can be stored in the player's resource pool
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxShards = player->GetMax();\n// Use maxShards to determine resource\
      \ capacity\nif (currentShards >= maxShards) {\n    // Handle resource overflow\
      \ or cap condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management Example
    code: "ManaSoulShardResourceDemo* resource = player->GetManaSoulShardResource();\n\
      uint32 max = resource->GetMax();\nuint32 current = resource->GetCurrent();\n\
      \n// Display resource status to player\nChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\n\
      \    \"Mana Soul Shards: %u/%u\", current, max);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during resource updates or UI refreshes.
    The maximum value may vary based on player class and level progression. Implementation
    assumes that the resource manager has been properly initialized and is valid.
  warnings: Do not use this value to directly set resource amounts - always use appropriate
    setter methods to maintain internal consistency and prevent invalid state transitions.
