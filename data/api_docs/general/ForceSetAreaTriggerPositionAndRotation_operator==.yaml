documentation:
  brief: Compares two ForceSetAreaTriggerPositionAndRotation objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison between
    two ForceSetAreaTriggerPositionAndRotation objects to determine if they are identical.
    This comparison checks whether both the position and rotation data members of
    the two objects match exactly. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this operation is typically used when validating or synchronizing area trigger
    states across different systems or when comparing configuration settings for area
    triggers. The method returns true if all corresponding components are equal, and
    false otherwise. This comparison is essential for maintaining consistency in game
    state management related to area triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both the position and rotation of the current object match
    those of the right-hand operand; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'ForceSetAreaTriggerPositionAndRotation trigger1({10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f},
      {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f});

      ForceSetAreaTriggerPositionAndRotation trigger2({10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f}, {0.0f,
      0.0f, 0.0f});

      bool isEqual = (trigger1 == trigger2); // Returns true'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct bitwise comparison of the position and rotation
    components. It assumes that the underlying data types (likely Vector3 for position
    and Quaternion or Euler angles for rotation) implement their own equality operators
    correctly.
