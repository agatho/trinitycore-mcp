  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ValidateObjectiveState
  signature: bool ObjectiveTracker::ValidateObjectiveState(Player * bot, const ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the state of an objective for a player bot, ensuring it meets required
    conditions.
  description: The ValidateObjectiveState method checks whether a given objective
    state is valid for a specific player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function ensures that objectives are properly initialized and meet all necessary
    criteria before being processed or updated. It typically verifies that required
    conditions such as quest completion, item possession, or player location are satisfied.
    The validation process may involve checking against the bot's current inventory,
    quest log, and other relevant game state information to determine if the objective
    can proceed or needs adjustment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose objective
      state is being validated. Must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState object containing the current state
      data to validate. This includes information about quest requirements, progress,
      and completion status.
  returns: Returns true if the objective state is valid and meets all required conditions
    for the bot; otherwise returns false if validation fails due to missing prerequisites
    or invalid state data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player object\nObjectiveState state = ...;\
      \ // Initialize objective state\nbool isValid = objectiveTracker->ValidateObjectiveState(bot,\
      \ state);\nif (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with objective processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Bot AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateObjective()\n{\n    if (objectiveTracker->ValidateObjectiveState(bot,\
      \ currentObjective))\n    {\n        // Objective is valid, continue with next\
      \ steps\n        ProcessObjective();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ invalid objective state\n        ResetObjective();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive checks involving database queries or complex
    state comparisons. It's recommended to cache results when possible to avoid repeated
    validations during high-frequency operations. The method assumes that the bot
    and objective state are properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers for either parameter, as it
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the ObjectiveState
    object contains valid data before passing it to this function.
