documentation:
  brief: Returns the localized name of the object based on the specified locale constant.
  description: This method retrieves the localized name of an Object instance using
    the provided locale constant. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft client
    interactions to fetch names in different languages or locales. The method operates
    on the object's internal name data and returns a string representation of the
    name according to the specified locale. This functionality is essential for proper
    localization handling within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the localized name of the object based on the
    provided locale constant, or an empty string if no name exists for that locale.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      std::string name = obj->GetNameForLocaleIdx(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      std::cout << "Name: " << name << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other localization functions
    and may require the object to have valid name data. Implementation details include
    handling of locale constants and internal name storage mechanisms.
  warnings: The method may return an empty string if no localized name exists for
    the specified locale, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly
    handled in code.
