documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the EquipmentManager
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the EquipmentManager
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the equipment management
    system. This manager handles player equipment-related operations including item
    equipping, unequipping, and equipment set management. The method ensures that
    only one EquipmentManager instance exists throughout the game server's lifecycle,
    making it thread-safe for concurrent access. It is commonly used by various subsystems
    that need to manage or query player equipment state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton EquipmentManager instance. The method never
    returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EquipmentManager* equipMgr = EquipmentManager::instance();

      Player* player = ...;

      // Use the equipment manager to handle player equipment

      equipMgr->HandlePlayerEquip(player, itemGuid, slot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Equipment in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    EquipmentManager* mgr =\
      \ EquipmentManager::instance();\n    // Apply equipment sets or handle initial\
      \ equipment\n    mgr->ApplyEquipmentSet(player, \"default_set\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers singleton pattern which is thread-safe in C++11
    and later. The EquipmentManager instance is initialized during server startup
    before any player connections are accepted. This ensures that all equipment-related
    operations can safely access the manager without worrying about initialization
    order issues.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned EquipmentManager
    instance as it's managed by the singleton pattern. Avoid calling this method from
    within constructor/destructor sequences of other singletons which might cause
    initialization order dependency issues.
