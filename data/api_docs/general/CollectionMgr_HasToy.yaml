  brief: Checks whether the player has a specific toy item in their collection.
  description: The HasToy method determines if a specified toy item is present in
    the player's collection. This method is typically used to verify ownership of
    a particular toy before allowing actions such as displaying it, using it, or checking
    its availability. The method performs a lookup within the player's toy collection
    database and returns true if the item exists, false otherwise. It does not modify
    any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified toy item is in the player's collection; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:

      You have the toy!\");\n} else {\n    // Player does not own this toy\n    SendToyNotification(\"\
      You don't have this toy.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal player data structures related to toy
    collections. It may involve database lookups or in-memory checks depending on
    how the collection system is implemented. The method is expected to be efficient
    as it's commonly used during gameplay interactions.
