  class: ScopedMLOperation
  method: ScopedMLOperation
  signature: void ScopedMLOperation::ScopedMLOperation(uint32_t botGuid, MLOperationType
    operation, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scoped ML operation with the specified bot GUID, operation
    type, and context.
  description: The ScopedMLOperation constructor initializes a scoped machine learning
    operation for a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets
    up internal tracking of the operation using the provided bot identifier, operation
    type, and contextual information. The operation is typically used in AI-driven
    systems where bots perform actions based on machine learning models. The context
    parameter allows for additional metadata to be associated with the operation,
    which can be useful for logging, debugging, or tracking purposes. This constructor
    likely manages resource allocation and ensures proper scoping of the ML operation
    within the bot's lifecycle.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will perform the ML
      operation. This value must be a valid GUID present in the game world.
  - name: operation
    description: The type of machine learning operation to be performed, represented
      by an enumeration value of type MLOperationType. This determines the specific
      behavior and processing logic applied to the bot.
  - name: context
    description: A string providing additional context or metadata about the operation.
      This can include information such as reason for execution, target state, or
      other operational parameters that may influence how the ML model processes the
      bot's actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Scoped ML Operation
    code: ScopedMLOperation op(12345u, MLOperationType::TRAINING, "Training session
      for combat AI");
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Different Operation Type and Context
    code: ScopedMLOperation op(botGuid, MLOperationType::INFERENCE, "Pathfinding decision
      at location (100, 200)");
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely manages internal state tracking and may register
    the operation with a global or bot-specific ML manager. It is important to ensure
    that the botGuid corresponds to an active bot in the world to prevent runtime
    errors.
  warnings: Passing an invalid botGuid may lead to undefined behavior or failed operations.
    The MLOperationType must be one of the defined values in the enumeration; otherwise,
    the operation might not execute correctly.
