  signature: void AIDecisionTimer::SetOutcome(DecisionOutcome outcome)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the outcome of an AI decision timer to determine subsequent behavior.
  description: The SetOutcome method configures the decision outcome for an AIDecisionTimer
    instance, which is used in TrinityCore's AI system to control how NPCs make decisions
    based on timing and conditions. This method allows developers to programmatically
    assign a specific DecisionOutcome value that will influence the AI's next actions
    or state transitions. The timer typically tracks time-based decisions such as
    when to perform an action, how long to wait between actions, or what path to take
    in decision trees. This method is commonly used within AI behavior scripts and
    modules where dynamic decision-making based on time constraints is required.
  parameters:
  - name: outcome
    description: The DecisionOutcome enum value that defines the result of the AI
      decision timer. Valid values typically include outcomes like SUCCESS, FAILURE,
      PENDING, or other AI-specific decision states that control subsequent behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a successful AI decision outcome
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer;

      timer.SetOutcome(DecisionOutcome::SUCCESS);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetOutcome in an AI behavior context
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (m_decisionTimer.IsExpired()) {\n            m_decisionTimer.SetOutcome(DecisionOutcome::FAILURE);\n\
      \            // Handle failure case\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the AIDecisionTimer.
    It should be called only when the timer has reached its decision point or when
    an external event triggers a change in outcome. The method does not validate the
    outcome value against valid enum values, so callers must ensure they pass appropriate
    DecisionOutcome constants.
  warnings: Calling SetOutcome on a timer that is still active may lead to unexpected
    behavior if the AI logic doesn't properly handle state transitions. Ensure that
    outcomes are set only at appropriate decision points and that the AI system can
    correctly interpret the new outcome value.
