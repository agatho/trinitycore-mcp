documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ItemScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ItemScript destructor is automatically invoked when an ItemScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the ItemScript
    instance. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, ItemScript objects
    are typically used to extend or modify item behavior through custom scripts. The
    destructor does not perform any special operations beyond standard object cleanup,
    as ItemScript is primarily a base class for implementing item-related script functionality.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing
    object lifetimes in custom code.

  - title: Automatic destruction of ItemScript instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    ItemScript* script = new ItemScript(\"CustomItemScript\"\
      );\n    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~ItemScript()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived class instances when deleted through base class pointers. This behavior
    is essential for correct memory management in TrinityCore's scripting architecture.
