documentation:
  brief: Archives AI decision records for performance analysis and debugging purposes.
  description: The ArchiveDecisionRecords method is responsible for saving or persisting
    AI decision-making data generated by the AIDecisionProfiler class. This functionality
    allows developers and administrators to analyze how AI entities make decisions
    over time, which is crucial for balancing game mechanics, identifying performance
    bottlenecks, and debugging AI behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The method typically writes decision logs to a persistent storage medium such
    as a database or file system, ensuring that historical AI data can be retrieved
    and analyzed later. It may also handle data cleanup or rotation to manage storage
    space efficiently.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.ArchiveDecisionRecords();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked periodically or upon specific events such
    as server shutdown to ensure that AI decision data is not lost. It may be thread-safe
    depending on implementation, but should be called from appropriate contexts to
    avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure sufficient storage space is available before calling this method,
    as it may generate large amounts of log data. Improper handling of archived records
    could lead to performance degradation or data corruption if not properly managed
    by the underlying storage system.
