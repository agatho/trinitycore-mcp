  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::HandleDeadZone(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the dead zone logic for a beast mastery hunter, adjusting behavior
    based on proximity to enemies.
  description: The HandleDeadZone method manages the behavioral state of a beast mastery
    hunter when it enters or exits a designated 'dead zone' area. This typically involves
    modifying the hunter's attack patterns, movement, or pet behavior in response
    to enemy proximity. The method likely evaluates the distance between the hunter
    and nearby enemies, and may trigger specific actions such as switching targets,
    initiating defensive maneuvers, or altering the pet's attack priority. It is part
    of the core AI logic for beast mastery hunters within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a state flag
      or distance threshold value used in dead zone calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleDeadZone with default parameters
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      int deadZoneThreshold = 10;

      hunter.HandleDeadZone(&deadZoneThreshold);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked during AI update cycles and may be sensitive
    to timing and proximity checks. It's recommended to ensure that the integer parameter
    passed is within valid game mechanics thresholds to avoid unexpected behavior.
