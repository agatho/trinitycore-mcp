  method: GetRolePriority
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetRolePriority(BotRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority value assigned to a specified bot role within the
    adaptive behavior manager.
  description: The GetRolePriority method returns a numeric priority value associated
    with a given BotRole enum value. This priority is used internally by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    to determine the order of importance for different roles when making decisions
    about bot behavior, such as assignment of tasks or resource allocation. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely informational. It assumes that
    the role has been properly initialized and registered with the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the priority level assigned to the specified
    BotRole. Higher values typically indicate higher priority, though exact semantics
    depend on how priorities are configured within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Priority of a Specific Role
    code: "uint32 priority = behaviorManager.GetRolePriority(BotRole::TANK);\nif (priority\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the priority value for decision making\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Tank role priority: \" << priority << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot behavior evaluation cycles. The
    returned priority values are often used in sorting operations to determine which
    roles should be prioritized when assigning tasks or determining action sequences.
