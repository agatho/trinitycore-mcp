documentation:
  brief: Loads a player's group data from the database
  description: This method is responsible for loading group information for a player
    from the database, including group members, group leader, and other group-related
    data. It typically gets called during player initialization or when a player joins
    a group. The method ensures that the player's group membership is properly established
    and that all group-related data is correctly loaded into memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadGroup(0);

      // This would load the player''s group data from database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal player initialization process and should
    not be called directly by external code. It typically handles database queries
    for group-related information and ensures proper synchronization between database
    and in-memory data structures.
  warnings: This method should only be called during player initialization or when
    explicitly required by game mechanics. Calling it at inappropriate times may cause
    synchronization issues or memory corruption.
