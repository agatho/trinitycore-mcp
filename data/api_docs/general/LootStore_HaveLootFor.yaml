  signature: bool LootStore::HaveLootFor(uint32 loot_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a loot template exists for the specified loot ID.
  description: The HaveLootFor method determines whether a loot template entry exists
    for the given loot identifier within the LootStore. This is commonly used to verify
    that a specific loot table (such as for a creature, game object, or item) has
    been properly loaded and contains valid loot data. The method performs a lookup
    in the internal loot storage structure and returns true if a matching loot template
    is found, otherwise false. This functionality is essential for preventing errors
    when attempting to retrieve or process loot data during gameplay mechanics such
    as creature looting or game object interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a loot template exists for the specified loot_id; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for loot template existence
    code: "if (lootStore->HaveLootFor(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with loot processing\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Loot template found for ID 12345\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle missing loot template\n    std::cout << \"No loot template\
      \ found for ID 12345\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used before attempting to access or process loot
    data to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. It's a lightweight check
    that relies on internal data structures and should not be called excessively in
    performance-critical code paths.
