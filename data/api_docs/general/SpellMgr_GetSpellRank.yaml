  signature: uint8 SpellMgr::GetSpellRank(uint32 spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the rank of a specified spell from the spell manager's database.
  description: The GetSpellRank method retrieves the rank of a given spell ID from
    the SpellMgr database. In World of Warcraft, many spells have multiple ranks that
    represent their increasing power or effectiveness as a player advances. This method
    allows code to determine which rank a specific spell corresponds to, enabling
    features such as spell progression tracking, rank-based effects, and proper spell
    handling in combat systems. The returned value represents the spell's rank within
    its spell line, where rank 1 is typically the lowest tier of the spell. If the
    spell ID does not exist or has no defined rank, the method may return 0 or an
    undefined value depending on internal implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the rank of the specified spell. A value
    of 0 typically indicates that the spell either does not exist in the database
    or has no defined rank. Higher values indicate higher ranks within the spell's
    progression line, with each increment usually corresponding to an upgrade in spell
    power or effect.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell Rank for Fireball
    code: "uint32 fireballSpellId = 133;\nuint8 rank = sSpellMgr->GetSpellRank(fireballSpellId);\n\
      if (rank > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Fireball is rank %u\\n\", rank);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Fireball has no defined rank or does not exist.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data structures and assumes that spell
    ranks are properly defined in the database or spell definitions. It is commonly
    used during spell initialization, effect application, or when determining spell
    effectiveness based on player level or talent points.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spell_id corresponds to an actual spell in the
    game's database; otherwise, behavior may be undefined. This method should not
    be called with invalid or uninitialized spell IDs as it might lead to incorrect
    rank retrieval or access violations.
