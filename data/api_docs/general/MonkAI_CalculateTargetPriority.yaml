  class: MonkAI
  method: CalculateTargetPriority
  signature: float MonkAI::CalculateTargetPriority(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value of a target for the Monk AI to
    determine optimal engagement.
  description: The CalculateTargetPriority method evaluates potential targets within
    the Monk AI's range and assigns them a priority score based on various factors
    such as threat level, distance, health percentage, and target type. This score
    helps the AI decide which enemy to attack or assist with healing first. The method
    is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle to dynamically prioritize
    targets in combat situations. It uses internal AI logic and player/creature data
    to compute this value.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used internally by the method to retrieve target information
      for priority calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the target. Higher
    values indicate higher priority, with 0.0 indicating no priority or invalid target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI decision logic
    code: "int targetGuid = 12345;\nfloat priority = ai->CalculateTargetPriority(&targetGuid);\n\
      if (priority > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Engage the target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's core decision-making system and should
    only be called when the AI has valid target data. The priority calculation may
    vary depending on the Monk's current form, abilities, and combat stance.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing creature or player entity; otherwise, the method may return unexpected
    results or cause undefined behavior.
