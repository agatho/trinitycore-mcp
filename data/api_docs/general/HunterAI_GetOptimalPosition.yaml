  class: HunterAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int HunterAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for the hunter to engage a target.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a hunter
    AI to move to in order to effectively engage a target. This calculation takes
    into account various factors such as distance, line of sight, threat level, and
    environmental obstacles. The method is typically used by the HunterAI class to
    make strategic movement decisions during combat. It returns an integer value representing
    the calculated optimal position index or status code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the result of the calculation. A positive
    value typically represents a valid optimal position index, while negative values
    may indicate errors or that no suitable position was found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "int optimalPos = hunterAI->GetOptimalPosition();\nif (optimalPos >= 0)\n\
      {\n    // Move to the calculated optimal position\n    player->MoveTo(optimalPos);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case - no valid position found\n    player->Say(\"\
      No optimal position available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex pathfinding and tactical calculations.
    The implementation may cache previous results or use heuristics to improve performance
    in real-time combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating failure conditions. Always
    check the return value before using the result for movement decisions.
