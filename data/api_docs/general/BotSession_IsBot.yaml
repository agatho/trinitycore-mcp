  signature: bool BotSession::IsBot() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current session represents a bot player.
  description: The IsBot method checks if the current BotSession instance is associated
    with a bot character rather than a regular player. This method is commonly used
    in TrinityCore's bot system to differentiate between human-controlled and AI-controlled
    characters. The check typically involves examining internal flags or character
    properties that indicate bot status. This functionality is essential for implementing
    bot-specific behaviors, restrictions, or game mechanics that should only apply
    to automated players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session represents a bot character, false otherwise.
    This boolean value allows conditional logic to be implemented based on whether
    the current player is an automated bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Check
    code: "if (session->IsBot()) {\n    // Handle bot-specific logic\n    session->SendBotMessage(\"\
      This is a bot.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle regular player logic\n    session->SendPlayerMessage(\"\
      This is a human player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Bot Status
    code: "void ProcessSession(BotSession* session) {\n    if (session->IsBot()) {\n\
      \        // Apply bot-specific AI behavior\n        session->ExecuteBotAI();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply normal player behavior\n        session->HandlePlayerInput();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal session flags or character data to
    determine bot status. It should be called frequently in performance-critical sections
    as it typically involves a simple flag check rather than complex computations.
