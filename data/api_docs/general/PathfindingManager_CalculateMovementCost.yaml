  class: PathfindingManager
  method: CalculateMovementCost
  signature: float PathfindingManager::CalculateMovementCost(const int & from, const
    int & to, const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the movement cost between two nodes in a pathfinding graph for
    use in navigation decisions.
  description: The CalculateMovementCost method computes the cost of traversing from
    one node to another within the game's pathfinding system. This value is typically
    used by pathfinding algorithms to determine the most efficient route between points.
    The method takes into account various factors such as terrain type, elevation
    changes, and potential obstacles that may affect movement. It is an essential
    part of the navigation system that helps NPCs and players move efficiently through
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The index or identifier of the starting node in the pathfinding graph.
  - name: to
    description: The index or identifier of the destination node in the pathfinding
      graph.
  - name: request
    description: A PathRequest object containing contextual information about the
      movement request, including unit type, movement flags, and other relevant parameters
      that may influence cost calculation.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated movement cost between
    the two nodes. This value typically represents the relative difficulty or distance
    of traversing from node 'from' to node 'to'. Lower values indicate easier traversal
    while higher values suggest more difficult or costly movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating path cost
    code: 'PathRequest request;

      request.movementFlags = MOVEFLAG_WALKING;

      request.unitType = UNIT_TYPE_NPC;

      float cost = pathfindingManager.CalculateMovementCost(10, 15, request);

      // cost now contains the movement cost between nodes 10 and 15'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated cost for path optimization
    code: "PathRequest request;\nrequest.movementFlags = MOVEFLAG_FLYING;\nrequest.unitType\
      \ = UNIT_TYPE_PLAYER;\nint startNode = 20;\nint endNode = 35;\nfloat cost =\
      \ pathfindingManager.CalculateMovementCost(startNode, endNode, request);\nif\
      \ (cost < 10.0f) {\n    // Consider this path as relatively easy to traverse\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during pathfinding calculations and should
    be optimized for performance since it may be invoked frequently. The implementation
    likely caches or pre-computes certain values to improve efficiency. It's important
    to note that the cost calculation might vary based on dynamic game state elements
    such as terrain changes, temporary obstacles, or unit-specific movement capabilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'from' and 'to' parameters represent valid nodes in the
    pathfinding graph; invalid indices may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. The PathRequest object must be properly initialized with relevant movement
    context for accurate cost calculations.
