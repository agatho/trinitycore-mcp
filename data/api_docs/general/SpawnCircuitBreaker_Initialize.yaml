  class: SpawnCircuitBreaker
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool SpawnCircuitBreaker::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SpawnCircuitBreaker instance, setting up internal state and
    resources for spawn management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a SpawnCircuitBreaker object for use
    by configuring its internal data structures, validating configuration settings,
    and establishing necessary connections or references to game systems. This method
    is typically called during the server startup process or when a new circuit breaker
    instance needs to be activated. It ensures that all required subsystems are ready
    before the circuit breaker begins monitoring spawn events. The method performs
    essential setup tasks such as initializing counters, registering event handlers,
    and loading configuration parameters from the database or configuration files.
    If initialization fails due to missing dependencies or invalid settings, the method
    returns false, indicating that the object is not ready for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SpawnCircuitBreaker was successfully initialized with
    all required resources and configurations; otherwise returns false if initialization
    failed due to missing dependencies, invalid configuration, or system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "SpawnCircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;\nbool success = circuitBreaker.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Circuit breaker is ready for use\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\"\
      , \"SpawnCircuitBreaker initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to initialize SpawnCircuitBreaker.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per instance. Repeated calls may result
    in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically non-blocking
    but may perform database queries or system checks that could introduce slight
    delays during server startup.
  warnings: Do not call Initialize() on an already initialized SpawnCircuitBreaker
    instance as it may lead to memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure
    all required configuration parameters are properly set before calling this method.
