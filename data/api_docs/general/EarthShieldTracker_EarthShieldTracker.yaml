  brief: Initializes a new instance of the EarthShieldTracker class.
  description: The EarthShieldTracker constructor initializes the tracking mechanism
    for earth shield effects in World of Warcraft. This class is responsible for managing
    the state and behavior of earth shield buffs, including tracking their duration,
    damage absorption, and application to targets. The initialization process sets
    up internal data structures necessary for monitoring earth shield effects on players
    and creatures within the game world.

  - title: Creating a new EarthShieldTracker instance
    code: 'EarthShieldTracker* tracker = new EarthShieldTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track earth shield effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new EarthShieldTracker
    object. It does not perform any validation or initialization of external dependencies,
    as those are typically handled by the parent class or system that manages this
    tracker.
