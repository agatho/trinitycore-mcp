  class: Unit
  method: SetCurrentCastSpell
  signature: void Unit::SetCurrentCastSpell(Spell * pSpell)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current spell being cast by this unit.
  description: This method assigns a spell to be the current cast for the unit, effectively
    marking it as the active spell being channeled or cast. The method updates the
    unit's internal state to reflect that a spell is currently being executed, which
    affects various game mechanics including interruptible spells, casting animations,
    and the ability to perform other actions during the spell's execution. This method
    is typically used when initiating a spell cast or when changing the current spell
    being cast by a unit.
  parameters:
  - name: pSpell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object that represents the spell currently being
      cast. This parameter must be a valid Spell pointer, otherwise the behavior is
      undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      Spell* spell = new Spell(unit);

      unit->SetCurrentCastSpell(spell);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not perform any validation on the Spell object itself, so
    developers must ensure that the spell is properly initialized and valid before
    calling this method. It's important to note that this method does not actually
    execute the spell; it merely sets the internal state of the unit to reflect that
    a spell is being cast.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the Spell object is valid can
    lead to memory access violations or undefined behavior. Additionally, care must
    be taken when using this method in multi-threaded environments as it may not be
    thread-safe and could cause race conditions if multiple threads attempt to set
    the current cast spell simultaneously.
