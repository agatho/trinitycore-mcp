documentation:
  brief: Collects and counts all debuffs affecting group members within the coordinator's
    scope
  description: The GatherGroupDebuffs method iterates through all group members managed
    by this DispelCoordinator instance and enumerates their active debuff effects.
    It aggregates information about these debuffs, including their types, durations,
    and intensities, returning a total count of all debuffs found across the group.
    This method is typically used during dispel operations to determine the scope
    and severity of magical effects that need to be removed or mitigated. The method
    does not modify any debuff states but rather provides a snapshot of current group
    debuff conditions for subsequent processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of debuffs found across all group
    members. Returns zero if no debuffs are present or if the coordinator has no active
    group members. Negative values may indicate error conditions or invalid internal
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dispel Logic
    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\nint debuffCount = coordinator.GatherGroupDebuffs();\n\
      if (debuffCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with dispel operations\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      dispel\", \"Found {} debuffs to process\", debuffCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Debuff Count for Priority Decision
    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\nint totalDebuffs = coordinator.GatherGroupDebuffs();\n\
      if (totalDebuffs >= 5) {\n    // Prioritize dispel actions for high-debuff groups\n\
      \    coordinator.ExecutePriorityDispel();\n} else if (totalDebuffs > 0) {\n\
      \    // Standard dispel routine\n    coordinator.ExecuteStandardDispel();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only scan of group member debuffs and should
    not be called excessively during high-frequency operations. The method relies
    on the internal state of the DispelCoordinator's managed group, so it will return
    inaccurate results if the group composition changes between calls without proper
    synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method on a coordinator with an invalid or uninitialised
    group may result in undefined behavior or segmentation faults. Ensure that the
    DispelCoordinator has been properly initialised with a valid group before invoking
    this method.
