  method: AdjustForThreat
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::AdjustForThreat(Player * bot, float & distance)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the follow distance based on threat level and player behavior
  description: The AdjustForThreat method modifies the distance a bot maintains from
    its leader based on the current threat situation. This method is typically used
    in AI behavior systems to ensure that bots maintain appropriate spacing during
    combat or high-threat scenarios. The adjustment considers factors such as the
    bot's current threat level, the leader's threat status, and overall group dynamics.
    It dynamically modifies the provided distance parameter to reflect optimal positioning
    for safety and tactical effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs threat-based
      distance adjustment
  - name: distance
    description: Reference to a float value representing the current follow distance,
      which will be modified by this method
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n    float currentDistance\
      \ = GetFollowDistance();\n    leaderBehavior.AdjustForThreat(bot, currentDistance);\n\
      \    SetFollowDistance(currentDistance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat management system
    code: "void LeaderFollowBehavior::AdjustForThreat(Player* bot, float& distance)\n\
      {\n    if (bot && bot->GetThreatManager().IsInCombat())\n    {\n        if (bot->GetThreatManager().GetHighestThreat()\
      \ > 1000.0f)\n            distance *= 1.5f; // Increase distance when under\
      \ high threat\n        else if (bot->GetThreatManager().GetHighestThreat() <\
      \ 100.0f)\n            distance *= 0.8f; // Decrease distance when threat is\
      \ low\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the distance parameter in-place and does not return
    a value. It assumes that the bot object has valid threat management capabilities
    and that the distance parameter is initialized with a meaningful baseline value.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method modifies the distance
    reference directly, so callers should be aware of potential side effects on their
    own distance calculations.
