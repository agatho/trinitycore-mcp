api:
  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: OnGroupFormed
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::OnGroupFormed(int groupGuid, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the formation of a new LFG group and updates internal state accordingly.
  description: The OnGroupFormed method is invoked when a new Looking For Group (LFG)
    activity results in a successful group formation. This method processes the group
    creation event, updates the internal LFG coordinator's state to reflect the new
    group, and ensures that all relevant systems are notified of the group's existence.
    It typically handles tasks such as assigning roles, updating dungeon queues, and
    managing player assignments within the group. The method returns true if the group
    formation was successfully processed, or false if an error occurred during processing.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the newly formed group. This value
      is used to track and reference the group throughout the LFG system.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The ID of the dungeon or instance that the group is being formed
      for. This identifies the specific content the group will attempt to complete.
  returns: Returns true if the group formation was successfully handled and processed
    by the LFG coordinator, otherwise returns false if an error occurred during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnGroupFormed
    code: "LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator();\nbool\
      \ success = coordinator->OnGroupFormed(12345, 123);\nif (success)\n{\n    //\
      \ Group was successfully formed\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"LFG\
      \ Group formed successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system upon successful
    group formation. It assumes that the group and dungeon IDs are valid and have
    already been validated before being passed to this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized groupGuid or dungeonId
    values may lead to undefined behavior or internal state corruption within the
    LFG coordinator.
