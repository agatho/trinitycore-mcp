documentation:
  brief: Returns the current use count of the game object
  description: The GetUseCount method retrieves the number of times a game object
    has been used, typically representing how many times it has been interacted with
    by players or NPCs. This value is often used to determine the state of the object's
    interaction and can be crucial for managing quest objectives, loot mechanics,
    or other game systems where object usage matters. The method returns a uint32
    value that reflects the internal counter tracking the number of uses.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current use count of the game object,
    which indicates how many times it has been interacted with or used in the game
    world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 useCount = gameObject->GetUseCount();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other game object interaction
    methods to determine whether an object has been fully interacted with. It may
    be updated when a player interacts with the object, and can affect quest progression
    or loot distribution depending on how it's implemented.
