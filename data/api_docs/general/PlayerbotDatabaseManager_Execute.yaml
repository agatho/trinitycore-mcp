  class: PlayerbotDatabaseManager
  method: Execute
  signature: bool PlayerbotDatabaseManager::Execute(const std::string & sql)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a SQL statement on the playerbot database and returns true if successful.
  description: The Execute method performs a SQL operation (such as INSERT, UPDATE,
    or DELETE) on the TrinityCore playerbot database. It is designed to handle database
    commands that do not return result sets, making it suitable for data modification
    operations. The method ensures thread-safe execution within the context of the
    playerbot system and handles connection management internally. This function should
    be used carefully as it directly interacts with the database and can affect player
    bot behavior and data integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: sql
    description: A string containing the SQL statement to execute. Must be a valid
      SQL command that modifies data rather than retrieves it. The statement should
      not contain user input without proper sanitization to prevent SQL injection
      attacks.
  returns: Returns true if the SQL statement executed successfully, false otherwise.
    Failure can occur due to invalid SQL syntax, database connection issues, or permission
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "bool success = PlayerbotDatabaseManager::Instance()->Execute(\"INSERT INTO\
      \ playerbots_blacklist (player_guid, bot_guid) VALUES (12345, 67890);\");\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Handle successful execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Bot Settings
    code: "std::string sql = \"UPDATE playerbots_config SET value='1' WHERE name='bot_enabled';\"\
      ;\nbool result = PlayerbotDatabaseManager::Instance()->Execute(sql);\nif (!result)\n\
      {\n    // Log error or handle failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot database manager and should only be
    used within the context of playerbot functionality. The database connection is
    managed internally, but developers must ensure SQL statements are properly formatted
    and safe from injection attacks. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized
    queries when dealing with dynamic data.
  warnings: Do not use this method for SELECT queries as it's designed for data modification
    operations only. Improperly formatted SQL can lead to database corruption or security
    vulnerabilities. Always validate input parameters before constructing SQL strings.
