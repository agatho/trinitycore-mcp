  method: DeleteEquipmentSet
  signature: void Player::DeleteEquipmentSet(uint64 id)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes a player's equipment set by its unique identifier.
  description: This method removes an equipment set from a player's saved equipment
    sets. The equipment set is identified by a unique uint64 ID, which typically corresponds
    to the set's GUID. When called, this method will remove the specified equipment
    set from the player's database storage, effectively making it unavailable for
    use in-game. This operation is typically used when a player wants to delete an
    equipment set that was previously saved, such as after changing gear or when a
    set is no longer needed.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the equipment set to be deleted.
      This value corresponds to the set's ID in the database and is typically generated
      when the set is saved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete Equipment Set Example
    code: 'Player* player = /* get player */;

      uint64 equipmentSetId = 1234567890;

      player->DeleteEquipmentSet(equipmentSetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's equipment set management system. It directly
    interacts with the database to remove the specified equipment set, and should
    be used carefully as it affects the player's saved equipment sets. The method
    may trigger a database update when executed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect deletion of equipment
    sets, which may result in loss of player data or unexpected behavior in-game.
    Ensure that the ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing set before
    calling this method.
