  class: Scenario
  method: GetCriteriasProgressFor
  signature: int Scenario::GetCriteriasProgressFor(const int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the progress value for a specific criteria within the scenario
    for the given player.
  description: The GetCriteriasProgressFor method fetches the current progress value
    associated with a particular criteria in the scenario context for the specified
    player. This method is typically used to determine how much of a scenario objective
    has been completed by a player, such as collecting items, defeating creatures,
    or achieving specific milestones. The returned integer represents the progress
    toward completing the criteria, which may be compared against the required threshold
    to determine if the criteria is fulfilled. The method requires a valid player
    reference and operates within the context of a scenario instance.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the scenario context. This value must be a valid player GUID or
      nullptr, where nullptr indicates no specific player is targeted.
  returns: An integer representing the current progress value for the criteria associated
    with the specified player in this scenario. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    no progress has been made, while values greater than 0 indicate partial or full
    completion depending on the criteria requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve progress for a specific player
    code: "int progress = scenario->GetCriteriasProgressFor(&playerGuid);\nif (progress\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Player has made progress on this scenario criteria\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if criteria is completed
    code: "const int* player = &playerGuid;\nint progress = scenario->GetCriteriasProgressFor(player);\n\
      if (progress >= requiredProgress) {\n    // Criteria is complete\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of a scenario instance and assumes
    that the player GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an active player in
    the scenario. The progress value returned may vary depending on the specific criteria
    being queried and the current state of the scenario.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that this
    method should only be called within a valid scenario context where the criteria
    are properly initialized.
