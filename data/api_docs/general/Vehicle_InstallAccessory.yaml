  method: InstallAccessory
  signature: void Vehicle::InstallAccessory(uint32 entry, int8 seatId, bool minion,
    uint8 type, uint32 summonTime, int rideSpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Installs a vehicle accessory with specified parameters including entry, seat
    ID, minion status, type, summon time, and ride spell ID.
  description: The InstallAccessory method is used to install a vehicle accessory
    onto a vehicle's specified seat. This method allows for the addition of creatures
    or objects as accessories to vehicles in World of Warcraft, typically used for
    creating mounts with additional creatures such as pets or summoned units. The
    accessory can be configured to behave as a minion and will be summoned for a specific
    duration. The ride spell ID determines which spell is associated with the accessory
    when mounted. This method is part of the vehicle system in TrinityCore and is
    essential for implementing complex mount behaviors where vehicles have additional
    entities attached to them.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID of the accessory to be installed. This corresponds
      to the entry value in the creature_template table.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID on the vehicle where the accessory will be installed.
      Must be a valid seat index, typically ranging from 0 to 7 for standard vehicles.
  - name: minion
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the accessory should behave as a
      minion. If true, the accessory will follow vehicle movement and actions.
  - name: type
    description: The type of accessory to install. Defines how the accessory behaves
      within the vehicle system (e.g., passenger, weapon, etc.).
  - name: summonTime
    description: The time in milliseconds for which the accessory will be summoned.
      Zero or negative values typically mean indefinite summoning.
  - name: rideSpellId
    description: The spell ID associated with riding the accessory. This determines
      which spell is cast when mounting the accessory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Install a basic vehicle accessory
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();

      vehicle->InstallAccessory(12345, 0, true, 0, 60000, 12345); // Install creature
      entry 12345 on seat 0 as minion for 60 seconds with spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Install a non-minion accessory with indefinite duration
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();

      vehicle->InstallAccessory(67890, 1, false, 1, 0, 54321); // Install creature
      entry 67890 on seat 1 as non-minion with no time limit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the vehicle's internal accessory management
    system. It should only be called after verifying that the vehicle exists and has
    sufficient seats available for installation. The accessory will automatically
    be removed when the summon time expires or if the vehicle is destroyed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the entry ID corresponds to a valid creature
    template, and that seatId is within acceptable range for the specific vehicle
    type.
