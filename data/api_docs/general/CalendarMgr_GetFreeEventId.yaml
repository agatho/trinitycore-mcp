documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique 64-bit identifier for a new calendar event.
  description: The GetFreeEventId method is responsible for generating a unique identifier
    (GUID) that can be used for a new calendar event within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that each calendar event has a globally unique ID, which is
    essential for tracking and managing events across the game world. It typically
    maintains an internal counter or uses a database-generated sequence to avoid ID
    collisions. The returned value is suitable for immediate assignment to a new CalendarEvent
    object's ID field.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique identifier (GUID) for a new calendar
    event. This value should be used as the ID when creating a new calendar event
    instance.
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Unique ID to a New Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent* newEvent = new CalendarEvent();

      newEvent->SetId(CalendarMgr::Instance()->GetFreeEventId());

      // Now newEvent has a unique ID that can be stored in the database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's part of the global CalendarMgr
    singleton. It may use atomic operations or locking mechanisms internally to ensure
    uniqueness across concurrent access. The implementation might rely on a database
    sequence or an in-memory counter that increments with each call.
