  class: QuestPickup
  method: NotifyQuestPickupSuccess
  signature: void QuestPickup::NotifyQuestPickupSuccess(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the player that a quest has been successfully picked up.
  description: The NotifyQuestPickupSuccess method is used to inform a player character
    that they have successfully picked up a quest from an NPC. This method typically
    sends relevant packets to the client to update the quest log and UI elements,
    ensuring the player's quest state is synchronized with the server. It is commonly
    invoked during quest acceptance or pickup events within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not return any value but triggers internal game state updates
    and network communication.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that was successfully picked up
      by the player.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who picked
      up the quest. Must be a valid player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup Notification
    code: "void HandleQuestPickup(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Assume\
      \ quest is validated and accepted\n    QuestPickup::NotifyQuestPickupSuccess(questId,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest has already been validated for pickup
    eligibility. It should only be called after all prerequisite checks have passed.
    The method internally handles sending necessary packets to update the client-side
    quest log and UI.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the quest or player state
    may result in inconsistent game state or client-side errors. Ensure that the questId
    corresponds to a valid, available quest for the player.
