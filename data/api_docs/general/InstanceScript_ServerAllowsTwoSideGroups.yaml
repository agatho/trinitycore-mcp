  class: InstanceScript
  method: ServerAllowsTwoSideGroups
  signature: bool InstanceScript::ServerAllowsTwoSideGroups()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two-sided groups are allowed to enter the instance.
  description: The ServerAllowsTwoSideGroups method checks if the server configuration
    permits players from different factions (Alliance and Horde) to form groups and
    enter the same instance. This setting is typically controlled by the server's
    configuration and can be overridden per-instance. When enabled, it allows cross-faction
    groupings in instances where such behavior is supported, which is essential for
    certain raid content and world events that require mixed faction participation.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the current server-wide policy regarding
    two-sided group entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether two-sided groups are allowed to enter
    the instance. Returns true if cross-faction groupings are permitted, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check Server Policy for Two-Sided Groups
    code: "if (instanceScript->ServerAllowsTwoSideGroups()) {\n    // Allow mixed\
      \ faction group entry\n    sLog->outString(\"Cross-faction groups allowed in\
      \ this instance.\");\n} else {\n    // Prevent mixed faction group entry\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Cross-faction groups not allowed in this instance.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method reflects the global server configuration rather than instance-specific
    settings. It is commonly used during group validation and instance entry checks
    to ensure compliance with server policies regarding faction-based content access.
