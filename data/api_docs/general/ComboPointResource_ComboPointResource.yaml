documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ComboPointResource object with default values.
  description: The ComboPointResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ComboPointResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the combo
    point resource, typically initializing counters, flags, or other member variables
    to their default values. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, combo
    points are used primarily by rogue and druid classes for special abilities and
    attacks. The constructor ensures that the resource starts in a valid, usable state
    with appropriate initial values for tracking combo points.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ComboPointResource instance
    code: 'ComboPointResource resource;

      // Initializes a new combo point resource with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new ComboPointResource
    object. Developers should be aware that the initial state of combo points may
    vary based on class and specialization, though this constructor handles the basic
    initialization of the resource container.
