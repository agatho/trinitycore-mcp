  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: IsZoneValid
  signature: bool BotWorldPositioner::IsZoneValid(uint32 zoneId, uint32 level, int
    faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a specified zone is appropriate for bot placement based
    on level and faction constraints.
  description: The IsZoneValid method checks if a given zone ID is valid for use by
    bots within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    whether the zone supports bot activity based on the player's level and faction,
    ensuring that bots are not placed in zones where they would be inappropriate or
    cause game balance issues. This validation helps maintain proper gameplay mechanics
    and prevents bots from entering restricted or invalid areas.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to validate. This corresponds to
      the ZoneID used internally by TrinityCore to identify different regions in the
      game world.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot attempting to enter the zone. Used to determine
      if the zone is appropriate for a bot of that level.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the bot (Alliance = 0, Horde = 1). Determines whether
      the zone is accessible based on faction restrictions.
  returns: Returns true if the zone is valid for the specified level and faction;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that bots should not
    be placed in this zone under the given conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Validation
    code: "if (botWorldPositioner.IsZoneValid(1337, 60, 0)) {\n    // Zone is valid\
      \ for an Alliance bot at level 60\n    std::cout << \"Zone is valid\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Zone is not valid for this configuration\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Zone is invalid\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Zones
    code: "uint32 zones[] = {1337, 1450, 1500};\nfor (uint32 zone : zones) {\n   \
      \ if (botWorldPositioner.IsZoneValid(zone, 50, 1)) {\n        std::cout << \"\
      Zone \" << zone << \" is valid for Horde bot at level 50\" << std::endl;\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against a database or configuration
    file that defines which zones are allowed for bots based on faction and level.
    It may also consider zone flags, expansion restrictions, and other game-specific
    constraints.
  warnings: Do not assume all zones returned as valid will be suitable for gameplay.
    Some zones might be valid but not appropriate for bot behavior due to lack of
    NPCs or quest availability.
