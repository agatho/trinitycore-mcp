  brief: Updates obstacle predictions for AI pathfinding and movement avoidance in
    the game world
  description: The UpdateObstaclePredictions method recalculates and refreshes the
    internal obstacle avoidance data structures used by the AI system. This method
    is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure that moving obstacles,
    such as other units or environmental hazards, are accurately accounted for when
    determining safe paths. It processes current obstacle positions, velocities, and
    predicted trajectories to prevent units from colliding with dynamic elements in
    the game world. The method does not directly affect unit movement but prepares
    the data necessary for avoidance calculations performed by related methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    obstacleAvoidanceManager.UpdateObstaclePredictions();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with movement logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should be called at appropriate
    intervals rather than every frame. It typically operates on a cached set of obstacles
    and updates their predicted positions based on velocity data. The method may internally
    use spatial partitioning or other optimization techniques to efficiently process
    large numbers of obstacles.
