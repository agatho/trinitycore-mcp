  method: GetThresholds
  signature: ResourceThresholds ResourceMonitor::GetThresholds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current resource thresholds configuration from the ResourceMonitor
    instance.
  description: The GetThresholds method returns a ResourceThresholds object that contains
    the configured limits and warning levels for various system resources such as
    memory usage, CPU load, or other monitored metrics. This method is typically used
    by the game server's monitoring systems to retrieve current threshold values for
    alerting and performance tracking purposes. The returned thresholds define when
    certain resource utilization levels should trigger warnings or actions within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourceThresholds object containing the current threshold values for
    monitored resources. This structure typically includes minimum, maximum, and warning
    thresholds for different resource types such as memory, CPU, or disk usage.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Current Resource Thresholds
    code: 'ResourceMonitor& monitor = ResourceMonitor::Instance();

      ResourceThresholds thresholds = monitor.GetThresholds();

      std::cout << "Memory threshold: " << thresholds.memoryThreshold << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation and does not require exclusive
    access to the ResourceMonitor instance. The returned ResourceThresholds object
    is a copy of the internal configuration, so modifications to it will not affect
    the monitor's actual thresholds.
  warnings: null
