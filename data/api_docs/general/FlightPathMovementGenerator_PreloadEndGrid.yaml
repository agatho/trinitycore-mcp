  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::PreloadEndGrid(Player * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Preloads the end grid for a player's flight path movement.
  description: The PreloadEndGrid method prepares and loads the destination grid for
    a player's flight path movement. This ensures that when the player reaches the
    end of their flight path, the necessary grid data is already loaded into memory
    to avoid performance hiccups during the transition. It is typically called as
    part of the flight path movement generator's internal logic to optimize grid loading
    and maintain smooth gameplay experience. The method operates on the player object
    passed to it and prepares the final destination grid for seamless movement continuation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Flight Path Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerFlightPathEnd(Player* player)\n{\n    FlightPathMovementGenerator*\
      \ flightGen = new FlightPathMovementGenerator(player);\n    flightGen->PreloadEndGrid(player);\n\
      \    // Continue with flight path completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and typically invoked
    automatically by the core movement generator logic. It should not be called directly
    unless implementing custom flight path behavior. The preloading occurs asynchronously
    to prevent blocking the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper context may lead to unexpected
    grid loading behavior or memory issues. Ensure that the player object is valid
    and in a flight path state before invoking this method.
