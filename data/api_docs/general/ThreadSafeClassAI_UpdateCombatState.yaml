documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state of the AI-controlled unit, managing engagement and
    behavior during active combat.
  description: The UpdateCombatState method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the combat status of an AI-controlled entity within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles logic related to targeting, threat management, spell
    casting, movement adjustments, and overall combat behavior while the unit is engaged
    in battle. It ensures that the AI adapts its actions based on current combat conditions,
    enemy positions, health status, and other relevant factors. The method is usually
    called periodically during the game loop to keep the combat state synchronized
    with the current battlefield situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat State Update
    code: "void UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // Called every frame during combat\n\
      \    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        // Update targeting and spell\
      \ casting\n        DoCombatUpdate();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main AI update loop and
    should be thread-safe as part of the ThreadSafeClassAI interface. It's important
    to ensure that combat-related updates don't cause performance bottlenecks during
    high-intensity battles with multiple units.
