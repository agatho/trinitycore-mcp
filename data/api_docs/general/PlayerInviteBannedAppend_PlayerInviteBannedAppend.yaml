  class: PlayerInviteBannedAppend
  method: PlayerInviteBannedAppend
  signature: void PlayerInviteBannedAppend::PlayerInviteBannedAppend(const std::string
    & playerName)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the list of banned invitees for the current player.
  description: The PlayerInviteBannedAppend method appends a specified player name
    to the internal list of players that are banned from receiving invites from the
    current player. This functionality is used in World of Warcraft's group invitation
    system to prevent certain players from being invited to groups, guilds, or raids.
    The method likely operates on a per-player basis and may be part of a larger system
    managing player relationships and invite permissions. It does not return any value
    but modifies the internal state of the player's banned invite list.
  parameters:
  - name: playerName
    description: The name of the player to be added to the banned invite list. Must
      be a valid player name string that exists in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ban a Player from Receiving Invites
    code: 'PlayerInviteBannedAppend("BadPlayer");

      // This will add "BadPlayer" to the current player''s list of banned invitees.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger Player class or related system that
    manages player interactions and permissions. The implementation may involve checking
    if the player exists in the game world before adding them to the ban list, and
    it might be synchronized with server-side data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerName parameter is properly validated to prevent
    invalid entries. Adding a non-existent player name could lead to undefined behavior
    or errors in the invite system.
