documentation:
  brief: Removes expired Deep Wounds damage over time effects from the warrior's target.
  description: The CleanupExpiredDeepWounds method iterates through the active Deep
    Wounds DoT effects on the warrior's current target and removes any that have expired.
    This method is typically called during the warrior's update cycle or when switching
    targets to ensure that outdated damage over time effects are properly cleared
    from the combat log and target state. Deep Wounds is a warrior ability that applies
    a bleed effect causing periodic damage over time, and this cleanup ensures accurate
    tracking of active debuffs.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Cycle
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update\
      \ logic ...\n    CleanupExpiredDeepWounds();\n    // ... rest of update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a list or container of active DoT effects,
    iterating through them to check expiration times. It's important that this cleanup
    occurs regularly to prevent accumulation of stale effect data which could affect
    combat calculations or visual feedback.
