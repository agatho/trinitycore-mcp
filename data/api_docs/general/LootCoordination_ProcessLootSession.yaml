  class: LootCoordination
  method: ProcessLootSession
  signature: void LootCoordination::ProcessLootSession(Group * group, uint32 lootSessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a loot session for a group, handling loot distribution and coordination.
  description: The ProcessLootSession method manages the coordination of loot distribution
    within a group during a loot session. It ensures that loot is properly distributed
    according to the group's loot rules, such as round-robin or master loot, and handles
    the synchronization of loot decisions among group members. This method typically
    gets invoked when a loot session begins or when a new item needs to be distributed
    to the group. The method operates on a specified group and uses a unique loot
    session identifier to track the specific loot event.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which the
      loot session is being processed. Must not be null.
  - name: lootSessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the loot session. Used to track and manage
      multiple simultaneous loot sessions within the same group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ProcessLootSession
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      LootCoordination::ProcessLootSession(group, sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    loot distribution events. It assumes that the group has already been validated
    and that the loot session is properly initialized. The method may involve synchronization
    with other systems to ensure consistent loot distribution across all players in
    the group.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer or an invalid lootSessionId
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is valid and
    that the loot session has been properly started before invoking this method.
