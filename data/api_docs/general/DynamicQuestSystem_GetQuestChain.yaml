  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::GetQuestChain(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest chain identifier associated with a specified quest ID
    in the dynamic quest system.
  description: The GetQuestChain method retrieves the quest chain identifier for a
    given quest ID within the dynamic quest system. This functionality is essential
    for managing quest dependencies and determining the hierarchical structure of
    quests in TrinityCore's dynamic quest framework. The method likely queries internal
    data structures or databases to map quest IDs to their respective chains, enabling
    features such as quest progression tracking, chain validation, and dynamic quest
    generation. It assumes that the quest ID provided corresponds to a valid quest
    within the system's scope.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the quest chain identifier associated with
    the specified quest ID. A return value of -1 typically indicates that no valid
    chain was found for the given quest ID, or the quest ID is invalid. Positive integers
    represent valid quest chain identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int chainId = dynamicQuestSystem.GetQuestChain(12345);\nif (chainId !=\
      \ -1) {\n    printf(\"Quest belongs to chain: %d\\n\", chainId);\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"No chain found for quest ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal lookups and may involve database queries
    or cached data structures. It is recommended to cache results when frequently
    accessing the same quest IDs to improve performance. The method should be called
    only after ensuring that the quest system has been initialized properly.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior
    or return values indicating no chain was found. Ensure that all quest IDs passed
    to this method are valid and registered within the dynamic quest system before
    invocation.
