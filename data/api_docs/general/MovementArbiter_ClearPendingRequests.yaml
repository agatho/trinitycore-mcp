  signature: void MovementArbiter::ClearPendingRequests()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all pending movement requests from the arbiter's internal queue.
  description: The ClearPendingRequests method removes all queued movement commands
    that have not yet been processed by the MovementArbiter. This function is typically
    used to reset or cancel outstanding movement operations, ensuring that no stale
    or outdated movement requests are executed. It effectively empties the arbiter's
    pending request list, which may be necessary during player logout, zone changes,
    or when resetting a character's movement state. The method does not affect currently
    executing movements but discards any queued requests that have not yet started.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear pending movement requests on player logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    if (GetMotionMaster())\n        GetMotionMaster()->ClearPendingRequests();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    should be used carefully during active movement operations to avoid unexpected
    behavior or movement interruptions.
