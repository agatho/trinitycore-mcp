documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battlemaster type associated with this battleground entry
  description: The GetType method returns the BattlemasterType enumeration value that
    defines the type of battleground or arena this entry represents. This value determines
    how the battleground is categorized within the game's system, including whether
    it's a normal battleground, rated arena, or skirmish match. The returned type
    is used internally by TrinityCore to route players to appropriate matchmaking
    systems and to handle different battleground rulesets. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BattlemasterType enumeration value indicating the type of battleground
    or arena this entry represents. Possible values include BM_TYPE_BATTLEGROUND,
    BM_TYPE_ARENA_RATED, BM_TYPE_ARENA_SKIRMISH, etc., depending on the specific battleground
    configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BattlemasterListEntry* entry = sBattlemasterListStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      BattlemasterType type = entry->GetType();\nif (type == BM_TYPE_BATTLEGROUND)\n\
      {\n    // Handle normal battleground\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Type Checking for Matchmaking
    code: "void HandleBattlegroundEntry(BattlemasterListEntry* entry)\n{\n    BattlemasterType\
      \ type = entry->GetType();\n    switch (type)\n    {\n        case BM_TYPE_BATTLEGROUND:\n\
      \            // Process normal battleground\n            break;\n        case\
      \ BM_TYPE_ARENA_RATED:\n            // Process rated arena\n            break;\n\
      \        case BM_TYPE_ARENA_SKIRMISH:\n            // Process skirmish arena\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and thread-safe, making it safe to call from multiple
    threads simultaneously. The returned value is cached within the BattlemasterListEntry
    object and does not require additional database lookups or computations.
