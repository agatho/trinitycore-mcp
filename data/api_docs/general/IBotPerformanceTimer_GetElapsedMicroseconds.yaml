  class: IBotPerformanceTimer
  method: GetElapsedMicroseconds
  signature: uint64 IBotPerformanceTimer::GetElapsedMicroseconds() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the elapsed time in microseconds since the performance timer was
    started.
  description: The GetElapsedMicroseconds method calculates and returns the number
    of microseconds that have passed since this performance timer was initialized
    or last reset. This is typically used for measuring execution times, profiling
    code sections, or tracking performance metrics within the TrinityCore framework.
    The timer's start point is usually set when the object is constructed or when
    a Start() method is called, depending on the implementation. This method is commonly
    used in bot AI logic to monitor how long specific operations take, ensuring that
    bots do not exceed performance thresholds and maintain responsiveness during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the number of microseconds elapsed since the
    timer was started. The value will be zero if the timer has not been started or
    reset, or if the timer is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Usage
    code: 'IBotPerformanceTimer timer;

      // ... some code execution ...

      uint64 elapsed = timer.GetElapsedMicroseconds();

      std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << elapsed << " microseconds" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Profiling in Bot AI
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void ProcessCommand() {\n        IBotPerformanceTimer\
      \ timer;\n        // Execute command logic\n        DoBotAction();\n       \
      \ uint64 elapsed = timer.GetElapsedMicroseconds();\n        if (elapsed > 1000)\
      \ { // 1ms threshold\n            sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Bot action\
      \ took %llu microseconds\", elapsed);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on high-resolution timing functions provided by the operating
    system. It is recommended to use this method for short duration measurements only,
    as long-running timers may overflow or lose precision depending on implementation
    details. The timer must be properly initialized before calling this method, otherwise
    it may return unexpected values.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for precise timing over very long durations
    due to potential integer overflow issues. Also, ensure that the timer object is
    in a valid state before calling this method; calling it on an uninitialized or
    improperly reset timer may result in incorrect measurements.
