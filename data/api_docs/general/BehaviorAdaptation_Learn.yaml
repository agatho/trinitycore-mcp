  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: Learn
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::Learn(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches a bot to adapt its behavior based on learned patterns and player
    interactions.
  description: The Learn method in the BehaviorAdaptation class enables a bot to acquire
    new behavioral patterns by observing and analyzing player actions. This method
    is typically invoked during gameplay when the bot needs to adjust its strategy
    or response mechanisms based on previous encounters or training sessions. It integrates
    with the broader AI system to enhance the bot's decision-making capabilities over
    time. The method operates asynchronously, meaning it may not immediately reflect
    changes in behavior but will apply learned adaptations in subsequent interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance that will learn
      new behaviors. This value must correspond to an existing bot within the game
      world and is used to locate and update the specific behavior adaptation data
      for that entity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      behavior.Learn(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "// Assuming a bot manager class exists\nBotManager* manager = BotManager::Instance();\n\
      uint32_t currentBotGuid = manager->GetCurrentBotGuid();\nif (currentBotGuid\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;\n    adaptation.Learn(currentBotGuid);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid bot GUID case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that store behavioral patterns
    and learning algorithms. It is recommended to call this method only when the bot
    has sufficient interaction history to ensure meaningful adaptation. The actual
    learning process may involve asynchronous operations or delayed execution depending
    on the AI implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to a valid, active bot instance;
    otherwise, the behavior adaptation data might not be correctly updated. Avoid
    calling this method too frequently in rapid succession as it could lead to performance
    degradation due to internal processing overhead.
