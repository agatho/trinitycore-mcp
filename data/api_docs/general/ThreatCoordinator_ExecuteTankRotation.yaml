  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ExecuteTankRotation
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::ExecuteTankRotation()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the current tank's rotation strategy and returns whether the rotation
    was successfully initiated.
  description: The ExecuteTankRotation method is responsible for triggering the execution
    of a predefined combat rotation specific to the tank role within a group or raid
    encounter. This method typically evaluates the current threat situation, checks
    if the tank is in a valid state to perform actions, and initiates the appropriate
    sequence of abilities or spells according to the configured tanking behavior.
    It may also handle transitions between different phases of the encounter or adjust
    the rotation based on incoming threat levels. The method returns true if the rotation
    was successfully started or executed, and false if it could not be initiated due
    to invalid conditions such as being in an inappropriate combat state or lacking
    necessary resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tank rotation was successfully initiated and executed;
    otherwise, returns false if the rotation could not be started due to invalid conditions
    like being out of combat, insufficient mana, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->ExecuteTankRotation()) {\n    // Rotation successfully\
      \ started\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Tank rotation initiated.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to start rotation\n    LOG_WARNING(\"AI\", \"Failed to initiate\
      \ tank rotation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making loops in encounter
    scripts and should only be invoked when the AI has confirmed that the current
    unit is a valid tank with an active threat situation. Performance-wise, this method
    may involve multiple checks and state evaluations before proceeding with the actual
    rotation execution.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of combat or when the unit is not properly
    configured as a tank; doing so may lead to undefined behavior or failed rotations.
    Also ensure that the AI system has correctly initialized threat tracking before
    invoking this function.
