documentation:
  brief: Returns the elapsed time in seconds since the battleground started
  description: The GetElapsedTime method retrieves the number of seconds that have
    passed since the battleground's start time. This value is commonly used to track
    match duration, determine when objectives should reset, or manage game state transitions.
    The returned value represents real-time elapsed seconds and updates continuously
    during active battleground sessions. This method is typically called by battleground
    systems to enforce time-based rules or display countdown timers to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds elapsed since the battleground
    started. Returns 0 if the battleground has not yet started or if the start time
    is not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Time
    code: "void MyBattleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    int elapsed = GetElapsedTime();\n\
      \    if (elapsed > 0)\n    {\n        // Display time remaining or elapsed\n\
      \        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_STARTED, elapsed);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Elapsed Time for Objective Management
    code: "void BattlegroundAV::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    int elapsed = GetElapsedTime();\n\
      \    if (elapsed > 1800) // 30 minutes\n    {\n        // Handle time-based\
      \ objective changes\n        HandleTimeBasedObjectives();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the battleground's internal start time tracking mechanism.
    The value returned is based on the system clock and may be affected by server
    time adjustments. For accurate time calculations, consider using GetStartTime()
    in combination with GetElapsedTime().
  warnings: The return value will be 0 if called before the battleground has officially
    started, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly checked. Ensure
    proper initialization of battleground start times before calling this method.
