  brief: Accepts a guild member invitation from the player's session
  description: The HandleAcceptMember method processes a guild membership acceptance
    request from a player's session. It validates that the player has been invited
    to join a guild and that the invitation is still valid. Upon successful validation,
    it adds the player to the guild roster and sends appropriate notifications to
    both the new member and existing guild members. This method is typically invoked
    when a player clicks 'Accept' on a guild invitation popup in the game client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Accept Handler
    code: "void HandleGuildAcceptInvite(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    if (session\
      \ && session->GetPlayer())\n    {\n        Guild* guild = session->GetPlayer()->GetGuild();\n\
      \        if (guild)\n        {\n            guild->HandleAcceptMember(session);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player's session contains valid invitation data.
    The method performs internal validation checks including checking for pending
    invitations and ensuring the player is not already in a guild. It also handles
    sending out guild chat messages and updating the guild's member list.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that an invitation exists may result
    in undefined behavior or error messages being sent to the client. Ensure proper
    session state validation before invoking this method.
