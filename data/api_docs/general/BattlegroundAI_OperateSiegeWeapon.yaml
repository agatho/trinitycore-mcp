  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: OperateSiegeWeapon
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::OperateSiegeWeapon(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Operates a siege weapon within the battleground, returning true if successful.
  description: The OperateSiegeWeapon method is responsible for handling the interaction
    with siege weapons during battleground events. It typically manages the activation,
    operation, or control of siege equipment such as catapults, ballistae, or other
    destructive structures. This method likely checks player permissions, validates
    the current battleground state, and ensures that only authorized players can operate
    these weapons. The method may also update internal game state variables related
    to weapon usage and cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier attempting
      to operate the siege weapon. This parameter is likely used to validate player
      access and ownership of the weapon.
  returns: Returns true if the siege weapon was successfully operated by the specified
    player, false otherwise. The method may return false due to invalid player state,
    insufficient permissions, or if the weapon is currently in use or cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Siege Weapon Operation
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (bgAI->OperateSiegeWeapon(&playerId)) {\n   \
      \ // Weapon operated successfully\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_SIEGE_WEAPON_OPERATED);\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to operate weapon\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_SIEGE_WEAPON_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the battleground AI system and may be called
    during specific battleground events or when players interact with siege weapon
    objects. The implementation may involve checking battleground state, player team
    affiliation, and weapon availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before passing it to this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. This method should only be called in contexts where
    battleground operations are active.
