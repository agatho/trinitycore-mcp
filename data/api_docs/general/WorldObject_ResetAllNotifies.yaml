  brief: Resets all notification states for the WorldObject, clearing pending notifications
    and restoring normal state.
  description: The ResetAllNotifies method clears all pending notifications that have
    been set on a WorldObject. This method is typically used to reset the state of
    a WorldObject's notification system, ensuring that no stale or outdated notifications
    remain in the system. It is commonly employed during object cleanup, reinitialization,
    or when transitioning between different game states. The method ensures that all
    notification flags are cleared and that the object's notification behavior returns
    to its default state.

  notes: This method should be used carefully during object lifecycle management,
    as it may affect notification-based gameplay mechanics. It is typically called
    when objects are being removed or reinitialized.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to missing notifications in game
    systems, potentially causing issues with object interaction or event handling.
