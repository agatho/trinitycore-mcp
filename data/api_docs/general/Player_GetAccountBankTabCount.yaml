  signature: uint8 Player::GetAccountBankTabCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bank tabs available to the player's account.
  description: This method retrieves the count of bank tabs that are accessible to
    the player's account. It represents the total number of bank tab slots available
    for use by the player, which is determined by the account's level and any applicable
    account-specific restrictions. The value returned by this method directly influences
    how many bank tabs can be created or accessed within the game world. This method
    does not take into account any individual character-specific bank tab restrictions
    or requirements, but rather focuses on account-level bank tab availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of bank tabs available to
    the player's account. The value typically corresponds to the maximum number of
    bank tabs that can be created for the account, which is usually 10 or more depending
    on account level and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 bankTabCount = player->GetAccountBankTabCount();\nif (bankTabCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player can access bank tabs\n    // Do something with bankTabCount\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other account-level banking
    functions and may be affected by account level restrictions or game mechanics.
    It's important to note that the actual number of bank tabs available might vary
    depending on server configuration and account permissions.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with character-specific bank tab counts,
    as it only reflects account-level bank tab availability. Also, this method may
    return different values depending on whether the player is in a realm where bank
    tab restrictions are enforced or not.
