documentation:
  brief: Sets a data element value for the player account.
  description: This method allows setting a specific data element value for the player's
    account, where the value can be either an int64 or float. It is used to store
    and update account-specific data elements such as achievements, statistics, or
    other account-related information. The method operates on the player's account
    data structure and ensures proper handling of different data types based on the
    element ID provided.
  parameters:
  - name: dataElementId
    description: The unique identifier for the data element to be set, typically representing
      a specific account-related value such as achievements or statistics.
  - name: value
    description: The value to set for the data element, which can either be an int64
      or float depending on the type of data being stored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting account data element with int64 value
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int64 value = 123456789;

      player->SetDataElementAccount(1, value);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting account data element with float value
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      float value = 123.45f;

      player->SetDataElementAccount(2, value);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the account data system and should be used carefully
    to ensure proper handling of data types. The implementation likely involves checking
    if the element ID exists and updating the appropriate storage structure accordingly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect data storage or retrieval,
    especially when dealing with different data types. Care must be taken to ensure
    that the correct value type is passed for each dataElementId.
