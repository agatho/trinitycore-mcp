  class: BloodDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation
  signature: void BloodDeathKnightRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the single-target threat rotation for a Blood Death Knight AI.
  description: This method implements the core logic for a Blood Death Knight's single-target
    combat rotation, focusing on maintaining threat and managing resource efficiency.
    It evaluates the current target and available abilities to determine the optimal
    sequence of actions, including melee attacks, ability usage, and defensive measures.
    The method is designed to be called during the AI's update cycle and integrates
    with the overall threat management system to ensure consistent aggro generation
    while optimizing for survival and damage output.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter specifies which enemy unit the Blood Death Knight should focus
      its rotation on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BloodDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already selected a valid target and that
    all necessary preconditions for combat are met. The implementation may internally
    handle ability cooldowns, resource management (Rune/Death Strike usage), and threat
    generation calculations.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring a valid target exists; passing
    an invalid or null target pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method
    should only be invoked during active combat scenarios.
