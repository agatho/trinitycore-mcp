  class: Map
  method: Map
  signature: void Map::Map(uint32 id, time_t param1, uint32 InstanceId, Difficulty
    SpawnMode)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Map instance with specified ID, time parameters, instance
    ID, and difficulty mode.
  description: The Map constructor initializes a new Map object with the given parameters
    including map ID, time parameters, instance ID, and difficulty spawn mode. This
    method is typically used during map creation or initialization in TrinityCore's
    game world system. The constructor sets up the basic properties of the map including
    its unique identifier, instance ID, and difficulty settings which are essential
    for proper map handling within the game engine. It also establishes the initial
    state of the map based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the map, typically representing the map
      ID or instance ID
  - name: param1
    description: Time parameter used for initialization, likely representing a timestamp
      or time-related value
  - name: InstanceId
    description: The instance ID associated with this map, used to identify specific
      instances of maps
  - name: SpawnMode
    description: The difficulty mode for spawn settings, determining how objects are
      spawned in the map
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Initialization Example
    code: Map* newMap = new Map(1234, time(nullptr), 5678, DIFFICULTY_NORMAL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Map Constructor Usage
    code: 'Map* map = new Map(mapId, param1, instanceId, difficultyMode);

      // Initialize map with proper parameters

      map->Initialize();

      // Set up map for gameplay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should be called only during map initialization or creation.
    The method sets up the basic map structure and may require additional setup steps
    depending on the context. Performance considerations include memory allocation
    and initialization time.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor can lead to invalid map objects or runtime
    errors. Make sure parameters are properly validated before calling this method.
