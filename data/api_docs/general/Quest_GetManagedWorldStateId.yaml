  class: Quest
  method: GetManagedWorldStateId
  signature: int32 Quest::GetManagedWorldStateId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the managed world state ID associated with the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier that represents the managed
    world state for a specific quest. The managed world state ID is used to track
    and manage quest-related game events, objectives, and progress within the World
    of Warcraft client. It typically corresponds to a specific WorldState or objective
    tracking mechanism in the game's internal systems, allowing developers to monitor
    and manipulate quest-related state changes. This identifier is crucial for implementing
    quest progression mechanics and ensuring proper synchronization between server
    and client states.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer identifier that corresponds to a
    managed world state ID used for tracking quest progress or objectives in the game's
    internal systems. This ID usually maps to a specific WorldState or objective tracking
    mechanism, and can be used to determine the current state of a quest within the
    game environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 worldStateId = quest->GetManagedWorldStateId();\nif (worldStateId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use worldStateId to track quest progress\n    // Example:\
      \ Update UI or trigger events based on this ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method is likely tied to internal
    quest tracking systems and may be used in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods like GetObjectiveCount or GetQuestState. Performance considerations include
    ensuring proper synchronization of world state IDs with server-side quest data,
    particularly when dealing with multiple quests simultaneously.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining quest completion
    status; instead, use appropriate quest completion methods or state tracking mechanisms.
    The managed world state ID may change during quest progression and should be re-evaluated
    after each quest update.
