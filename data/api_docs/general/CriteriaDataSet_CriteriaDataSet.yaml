documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CriteriaDataSet object with default values.
  description: The CriteriaDataSet constructor initializes a new instance of the CriteriaDataSet
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, preparing it for
    use in tracking and managing criteria data within the TrinityCore framework. The
    constructor typically initializes member variables to their default states, ensuring
    that the object is in a valid condition before any operations are performed on
    it. In the context of World of Warcraft's achievement and quest systems, this
    class likely serves as a container for storing criterion-related data that is
    used to determine progress towards achievements or quest completion.

  - title: Basic instantiation of CriteriaDataSet
    code: 'CriteriaDataSet dataSet;

      // Creates a new CriteriaDataSet object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, so it does not accept any parameters. The
    internal state will be initialized to default values appropriate for the class's
    intended use in tracking criteria data.
