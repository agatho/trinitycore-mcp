  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: DeathKnightAI
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::DeathKnightAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Death Knight AI instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The DeathKnightAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a player-controlled
    Death Knight in the TrinityCore emulator. This method sets up the necessary internal
    state and configuration required for the Death Knight to function properly within
    the game's AI system. It typically configures abilities, cooldowns, and combat
    strategies specific to the Death Knight class. The initialization process ensures
    that the bot can respond appropriately to various combat situations and execute
    Death Knight-specific actions such as using runes, managing disease effects, and
    handling special abilities like Death Grip or Raise Dead.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Death Knight bot that
      this AI instance will control. Must not be null and must represent a valid player
      with Death Knight class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DeathKnightAI Initialization
    code: 'Player* deathKnightBot = new Player();

      deathKnightBot->SetClass(CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT);

      DeathKnightAI* dkAI = new DeathKnightAI(deathKnightBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing DeathKnightAI with Existing Bot
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nif (player && player->getClass() == CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT)\n{\n   \
      \ DeathKnightAI* ai = new DeathKnightAI(player);\n    // AI is now ready to\
      \ control the Death Knight\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called for Player objects that are confirmed
    to be Death Knights. The AI system relies on proper initialization of class-specific
    mechanics such as rune management, disease tracking, and cooldown handling. This
    method does not perform any combat-related setup or state transitions; it merely
    initializes the AI framework.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a Player object that is not a Death Knight to
    this constructor will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify
    that the player object represents a valid Death Knight before calling this constructor.
