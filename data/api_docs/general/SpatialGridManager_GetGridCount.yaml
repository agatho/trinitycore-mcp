  class: SpatialGridManager
  method: GetGridCount
  signature: size_t SpatialGridManager::GetGridCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of grids managed by the SpatialGridManager instance.
  description: The GetGridCount method provides a count of all active spatial grids
    within the manager. This is useful for monitoring system resources, debugging
    spatial partitioning behavior, or determining the scale of the world grid system.
    The returned value represents the current number of grids in memory and may vary
    based on the loaded areas and dynamic grid creation/destruction during runtime.
    This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter and does not
    modify any state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of grids currently managed
    by the SpatialGridManager instance. Returns zero if no grids are present or if
    the manager has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Grid Count
    code: 'SpatialGridManager* gridManager = sMapMgr->GetGridManager();

      size_t count = gridManager->GetGridCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Current grid count: %zu", count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Grid Count for Performance Logging
    code: "void LogSpatialGridStats()\n{\n    SpatialGridManager* gridManager = sMapMgr->GetGridManager();\n\
      \    size_t gridCount = gridManager->GetGridCount();\n    \n    if (gridCount\
      \ > 1000)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARNING(\"misc\", \"High grid count detected:\
      \ %zu\", gridCount);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"misc\",\
      \ \"Normal grid count: %zu\", gridCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread that has access
    to the SpatialGridManager instance. The grid count includes all grids regardless
    of whether they contain objects or are empty. Performance impact is minimal as
    it only reads a cached counter value.
  warnings: The returned grid count may not reflect the actual number of grids in
    the world map if some grids have been marked for deletion but not yet removed
    from memory. The method does not account for temporary or pending grid operations
    that might occur during server updates.
