  class: QuestValidation
  method: IsQuestRepeatable
  signature: bool QuestValidation::IsQuestRepeatable(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified quest is repeatable for a given player character.
  description: The IsQuestRepeatable method checks if a quest identified by its unique
    quest ID can be repeated by the specified player. This functionality is essential
    for quest management systems within TrinityCore, particularly when determining
    if a player should be allowed to accept or turn in a quest multiple times. The
    method evaluates various quest flags and player state conditions to make this
    determination. It considers whether the quest has the repeatable flag set, if
    the player meets prerequisites, and if any cooldowns or completion restrictions
    are in place. This check is commonly used in automated questing bots or AI systems
    to avoid attempting repeatable quests when they are not available.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest to check for repeatability.
      Must be a valid quest ID present in the game's quest database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      availability is being evaluated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest is repeatable for the specified player, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the quest is not flagged
    as repeatable, the player has not completed it enough times, or other restrictions
    apply.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a quest is repeatable
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* player = ...; // obtained from somewhere\n\
      if (QuestValidation::IsQuestRepeatable(questId, player)) {\n    // Quest can\
      \ be repeated\n    printf(\"Quest %u is repeatable\\n\", questId);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Quest cannot be repeated\n    printf(\"Quest %u is not repeatable\\\
      n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in an automated questing system
    code: "void ProcessQuests(Player* player) {\n    for (uint32 questId : GetAvailableQuests(player))\
      \ {\n        if (QuestValidation::IsQuestRepeatable(questId, player)) {\n  \
      \          // Attempt to repeat the quest\n            player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest state tracking and may perform
    database lookups or cached checks depending on TrinityCore's implementation. It
    should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it might involve
    multiple validation steps.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, otherwise undefined behavior will occur. Also, note that quest flags and
    repeatable status may change based on game events or expansions.
