documentation:
  brief: Triggers character login process for all active bot sessions in the world.
  description: The TriggerCharacterLoginForAllSessions method initiates the character
    login sequence for every bot session currently managed by the BotWorldSessionMgr.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when reinitializing
    bot connections to ensure that all configured bot characters are properly logged
    into the game world. It iterates through all active sessions and calls the appropriate
    login logic for each, potentially involving authentication checks, character state
    restoration, and session initialization. The method does not return any value
    but may affect session states and player availability in the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotWorldSessionMgr::instance()->TriggerCharacterLoginForAllSessions();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a stable state and
    all necessary systems are initialized. It may cause temporary performance overhead
    due to concurrent session processing.
  warnings: Calling this method while sessions are already active or during critical
    operations might lead to undefined behavior or login failures. Ensure that no
    other login processes are running concurrently.
