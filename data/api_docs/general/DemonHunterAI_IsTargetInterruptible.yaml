  method: IsTargetInterruptible
  signature: bool DemonHunterAI::IsTargetInterruptible(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current target can be interrupted during spell casting.
  description: The IsTargetInterruptible method evaluates if the Demon Hunter's current
    target is in a state that allows spell interruption. This is crucial for determining
    when to use abilities like Disrupt or other interrupt-based mechanics. The method
    typically checks if the target is currently casting a spell, channeling an ability,
    or otherwise engaged in castable actions that can be interrupted. It returns true
    if the target is interruptible and false otherwise, which helps the AI decide
    on optimal timing for interrupt usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object to evaluate for interruptibility. This
      parameter is expected to point to a valid Unit object representing the target
      in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the target is currently casting or channeling a spell that
    can be interrupted, false otherwise. The method may also return false if the target
    is not a valid unit or is in an un-interruptible state such as being stunned or
    immune to interruption effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Demon Hunter AI logic
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->IsTargetInterruptible(&target)) {\n    // Use interrupt\
      \ ability\n    DoInterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking target interruptibility before casting a spell
    code: "Unit* currentTarget = me->GetVictim();\nif (currentTarget && demonHunterAI->IsTargetInterruptible(&currentTarget))\
      \ {\n    // Target is interruptible, proceed with interrupting spell\n    if\
      \ (me->CastSpell(currentTarget, SPELL_DISRUPT, true)) {\n        // Interrupt\
      \ successful\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game state tracking to determine if
    a target is in the middle of casting or channeling. It's important to note that
    not all spell casters are interruptible - some abilities may have immunity to
    interruption effects. The method should be called with a valid target pointer
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid Unit object before
    calling this method, as passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Also, be aware that some high-priority abilities may not
    be interruptible even if they appear to be in a casting state.
