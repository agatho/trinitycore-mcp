    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is never visible for a specific seer.
  description: This method checks if a player is never visible to a specified seer,
    typically used in the context of object visibility and player tracking within
    World of Warcraft. It evaluates whether the player's visibility should be restricted
    based on certain conditions, such as being invisible or having no visible objects
    for the seer. The method returns true when the player is not visible for the seer,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining game mechanics
    related to player visibility and object interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to the object that is checking visibility. This represents
      the entity or observer that is attempting to see the player.
  - name: allowServersideObjects
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether server-side objects are allowed in
      the visibility check. When true, allows server-side objects to be considered
      for visibility; when false, only client-side objects are checked.
  returns: Returns true if the player is never visible for the specified seer, otherwise
    false. This indicates that the player's visibility is restricted or not visible
    to the seer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool isVisible = player->IsNeverVisibleFor(&seer, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (player->IsNeverVisibleFor(&seer, false)) {\n    // Player is not visible\
      \ to seer\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is visible to seer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with visibility checks and player
    tracking systems. It may be affected by server-side object settings and can impact
    game mechanics related to player visibility. Performance considerations include
    checking visibility for each player object during gameplay.
  warnings: The method may behave differently depending on the type of seer object
    being passed, and it's important to ensure that the seer pointer is valid before
    calling this method. Incorrect usage could lead to visibility issues or game mechanics
    problems.
