documentation:
  brief: Distributes threat values among group members to balance aggro in a raid
    or party setting.
  description: The BalanceThreatDistribution method is responsible for redistributing
    threat values among players within a group or raid instance to maintain balanced
    aggro. This ensures that no single player accumulates excessive threat, which
    could lead to unbalanced combat dynamics or tank switching issues. The method
    typically operates during combat events or periodic updates to ensure fair distribution
    of threat across all group members. It is commonly used in conjunction with threat
    management systems to enforce proper raid mechanics and prevent threat stacking
    by individual players.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        m_threatCoordinator->BalanceThreatDistribution();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during periodic threat updates or combat
    events. It may perform calculations based on group composition, player levels,
    and current threat values to determine fair distribution ratios. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through all group members and adjusting their threat
    values according to a balancing algorithm.
  warnings: Improper use of this method in non-combat situations could cause unexpected
    behavior or disrupt normal threat mechanics. Ensure that the method is only called
    when appropriate (e.g., during combat) to avoid unintended consequences.
