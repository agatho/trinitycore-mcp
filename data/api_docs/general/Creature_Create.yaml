  class: Creature
  method: Create
  signature: bool Creature::Create(int guidlow, int * map, uint32 entry, const int
    & pos, const CreatureData * data, uint32 vehId, bool dynamic)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and spawns a new creature instance with specified parameters
    on the given map.
  description: The Creature::Create method is responsible for initializing a new creature
    object within the TrinityCore framework. It sets up the creature's basic properties
    such as GUID, entry ID, position, and associated data. The method handles the
    creation of both regular creatures and those that are part of vehicle systems.
    This function is typically used during world initialization or when dynamically
    spawning creatures in response to game events. It ensures proper integration with
    the map system and maintains internal creature state consistency. The method returns
    true upon successful creation and false if any critical error occurs during initialization.
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: Low GUID value for the creature, used to uniquely identify this instance
      within the server
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the map object where the creature will be spawned
  - name: entry
    description: Creature entry ID from the creature_template table that defines the
      creature's base properties
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to a position structure containing x, y, z coordinates
      and orientation for creature placement
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to CreatureData structure containing additional creature-specific
      data from the database
  - name: vehId
    description: Vehicle ID if the creature is part of a vehicle system, otherwise
      0 for regular creatures
  - name: dynamic
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a dynamic spawn (true) or
      static spawn (false)
  returns: Returns true if the creature was successfully created and initialized,
    false otherwise. Failure can occur due to invalid parameters, map issues, or database
    inconsistencies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Creation
    code: "Creature* creature = new Creature();\nPosition pos;\npos.Relocate(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 300.0f, 1.57f);\nCreatureData data;\ndata.id = 12345;\nbool success\
      \ = creature->Create(54321, &map, 1000, pos, &data, 0, false);\nif (success)\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Creature created successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Vehicle Creature Creation
    code: "Creature* vehicleCreature = new Creature();\nPosition pos;\npos.Relocate(500.0f,\
      \ 600.0f, 700.0f, 0.0f);\nCreatureData data;\ndata.id = 98765;\nbool success\
      \ = vehicleCreature->Create(98765, &map, 2000, pos, &data, 1234, true);\nif\
      \ (success)\n    sLog->outString(\"Vehicle creature created successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when spawning
    creatures. Developers should ensure that all parameters are valid before calling
    this method, particularly the map pointer and position data. The method performs
    internal validation of GUID values and entry IDs against database records.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters can lead to memory corruption
    or server instability. The map parameter must be a valid pointer to an active
    map object. Never call Create() on already existing creature instances as it will
    overwrite existing data without proper cleanup.
