  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up the machine learning performance tracking system
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all active performance monitoring activities
    within the MLPerformanceTracker class. It ensures proper cleanup of resources,
    stops any ongoing data collection processes, and finalizes the tracking session.
    This method should be called before the application exits or when performance
    tracking is no longer required to prevent memory leaks and ensure system stability.
    The shutdown process typically involves flushing remaining data, closing open
    connections, and releasing allocated memory blocks used for tracking metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: MLPerformanceTracker::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server shutdown or when disabling
    machine learning performance monitoring. It's important to ensure no other threads
    are actively using the tracker before calling Shutdown to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while active tracking operations are in progress may
    result in loss of incomplete data. Always ensure all tracking tasks are completed
    or cancelled before invoking this method.
