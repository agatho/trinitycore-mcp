  method: GetCurrentSituation
  signature: CombatSituation CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetCurrentSituation() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current combat situation state for the integration.
  description: The GetCurrentSituation method returns the current CombatSituation
    enum value that represents the active combat state of the integration. This method
    is used to determine what kind of combat behavior should be applied at any given
    moment, such as whether the unit is engaged in melee combat, ranged combat, or
    is in a non-combat state. The returned value can be used by AI systems to make
    decisions about movement, spell casting, and targeting. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CombatSituation enum value indicating the current combat scenario. Possible
    values include IDLE, MELEE_COMBAT, RANGED_COMBAT, SPELL_CASTING, or other combat-related
    states defined in the CombatSituation enumeration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatSituation situation = integration.GetCurrentSituation();\nif (situation\
      \ == CombatSituation::MELEE_COMBAT)\n{\n    // Handle melee combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Decision Making
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    CombatSituation current = GetCurrentSituation();\n\
      \    switch (current)\n    {\n        case CombatSituation::MELEE_COMBAT:\n\
      \            // Move to melee range\n            break;\n        case CombatSituation::RANGED_COMBAT:\n\
      \            // Maintain distance and use ranged attacks\n            break;\n\
      \        default:\n            // Default behavior for non-combat states\n \
      \           break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not perform any locking operations. It
    should be called frequently in AI update loops to ensure up-to-date combat state
    information.
  warnings: The returned CombatSituation value may change rapidly during combat transitions,
    so it's recommended to cache the result if multiple checks are needed within a
    single frame or update cycle.
