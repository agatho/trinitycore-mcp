  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: Reset
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the group coordinator's internal state to its initial condition.
  description: The Reset method clears all active group-related data and returns the
    GroupCoordinator instance to its default uninitialized state. This method is typically
    invoked when a group is disbanded, terminated, or when the coordinator needs to
    be reinitialized for a new group operation. It ensures that any previous group
    membership, leader information, or pending operations are cleared from memory.
    The reset process may also invalidate cached data and prepare the coordinator
    for reuse with a new group configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.Reset(); // Clears all internal state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to clear all group-related
    data. It's typically used internally by the group management system and shouldn't
    be invoked directly unless handling group cleanup or reinitialization scenarios.
  warnings: Calling Reset while a group is actively being processed may lead to undefined
    behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all group operations are completed before
    invoking this method.
