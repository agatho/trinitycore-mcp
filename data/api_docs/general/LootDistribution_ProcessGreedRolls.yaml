  class: LootDistribution
  method: ProcessGreedRolls
  signature: uint32 LootDistribution::ProcessGreedRolls(LootRoll & roll)
documentation:
  brief: Processes greed rolls for a loot item and returns the number of players who
    rolled greed.
  description: The ProcessGreedRolls method handles the logic for evaluating greed
    rolls in a loot distribution scenario. It iterates through all players who have
    rolled on a specific loot item, determines if their roll was a greed roll (as
    opposed to a pass or need), and updates the loot distribution state accordingly.
    This method is typically invoked during the loot rolling phase of a group loot
    system, where players vote on whether they want to greed on an item. The method
    ensures that only valid greed rolls are counted and processed, and it returns
    the total count of such rolls. It plays a crucial role in determining how loot
    is distributed among group members based on their individual roll decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of players who rolled greed on the specified loot item.
    A return value of zero indicates no players rolled greed, while any positive integer
    represents the count of valid greed rolls processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootRoll roll;\nuint32 greedCount = lootDistribution->ProcessGreedRolls(roll);\n\
      if (greedCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle greed roll results\n    printf(\"%u players\
      \ rolled greed\\n\", greedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LootRoll object has already been initialized
    with valid player rolls and that the loot distribution system is in an appropriate
    state for processing greed rolls. The method may modify internal state variables
    of the LootDistribution class to reflect processed rolls.
