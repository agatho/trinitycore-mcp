documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a guardian.
  description: This method checks if the current Unit object represents a guardian
    entity within the game world. Guardians are typically creatures that serve as
    protectors or defenders of players, often summoned through spells like Summon
    Guardian or similar mechanics. The method returns true when the unit is identified
    as a guardian, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for determining
    the behavior and role of units in various game systems including combat, summoning,
    and AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a guardian, false otherwise. The method does
    not return null or error values as it's a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsGuardian()) {\n    // Handle guardian-specific behavior\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal unit flags and creature type checks. Performance
    impact is minimal as it simply checks existing properties rather than performing
    complex operations.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is a pet or summon,
    as these are distinct categories with different behaviors and rules in TrinityCore.
