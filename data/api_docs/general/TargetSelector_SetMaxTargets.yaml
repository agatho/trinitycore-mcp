  class: TargetSelector
  method: SetMaxTargets
  signature: void TargetSelector::SetMaxTargets(uint32 maxTargets)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of targets that the target selector will consider.
  description: The SetMaxTargets method configures the upper limit on the number of
    valid targets that a TargetSelector instance will evaluate when selecting targets
    for AI behavior. This parameter directly influences how many potential targets
    are considered during target selection logic, which can affect both performance
    and the AI's decision-making process. The maximum targets value is typically used
    in conjunction with other target selection criteria such as range, threat level,
    or faction to determine the final target. This method does not validate the input
    value but assumes that a reasonable positive integer will be provided.
  parameters:
  - name: maxTargets
    description: The maximum number of targets to consider during target selection.
      Must be a positive integer. Values of zero or very large numbers may lead to
      unexpected behavior or performance issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TargetSelector selector;

      selector.SetMaxTargets(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Maximum Targets for a Spell AI
    code: "class MySpellAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeAI()\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (me->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n       \
      \     // Limit to 3 targets for area of effect spells\n            selector.SetMaxTargets(3);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that affects target selection logic.
    It is recommended to call this method before the AI begins targeting operations.
    The actual number of targets selected may be less than maxTargets depending on
    other filters and conditions applied by the selector.
  warnings: Setting maxTargets to zero will effectively disable target selection for
    this instance. Very large values may cause performance degradation due to excessive
    iteration over potential targets.
