  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: ExecuteCCChain
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::ExecuteCCChain(int * player, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a chain of crowd control effects on a target player.
  description: The ExecuteCCChain method in PvPCombatAI is responsible for applying
    a sequence of crowd control abilities to a specified target player. This method
    typically manages the execution order and logic of chaining multiple CC effects,
    ensuring proper cooldowns and targeting mechanics are respected during PvP encounters.
    It integrates with the AI's combat decision-making system to determine when and
    how to apply these effects in a strategic manner.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that will execute the chain of crowd
      control abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player object that will be subjected to the
      chain of crowd control effects.
  returns: Returns true if the chain of crowd control effects was successfully executed
    and applied to the target, false otherwise. The method may return false if preconditions
    such as valid targets or sufficient resources are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CC Chain Execution
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nPlayer* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(targetGuid);\n\
      if (ai && targetPlayer)\n{\n    bool success = ai->ExecuteCCChain(&player, &targetPlayer);\n\
      \    if (success)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"pvp\", \"CC chain successfully executed\
      \ on player %s\", targetPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI's combat behavior system and should only be
    called when the AI has determined that a chain of crowd control effects is beneficial
    for the current PvP situation. The implementation likely includes checks for target
    validity, ability availability, and cooldown states.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of player and target objects
    may result in crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that both player and target
    pointers are valid before invoking this method.
