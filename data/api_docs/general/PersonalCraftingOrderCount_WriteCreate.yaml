  class: PersonalCraftingOrderCount
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void PersonalCraftingOrderCount::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const
    Player * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes crafting order count data for transmission to a player client
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the personal crafting order count
    information into a ByteBuffer for network transmission to a specific player client.
    This method is typically used when sending initial crafting order data to a player,
    such as when they log in or when their crafting orders are first displayed. The
    serialization process includes relevant crafting order metadata that the client
    needs to render and manage crafting requests. The method takes ownership of the
    data serialization and ensures proper formatting for the World of Warcraft protocol.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized crafting order count
      data will be written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      orders being sent
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized crafting
      order count data
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = session->GetPlayer();

      Player* receiver = targetPlayer;

      orderCount.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      session->SendPacket(&data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system for
    crafting orders. It assumes that the ByteBuffer is properly initialized and that
    both player objects are valid. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input parameters beyond basic pointer checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner and receiver players are valid before calling this
    method, as passing null pointers may cause undefined behavior. The data buffer
    should be cleared or reset before calling this method to avoid data corruption.
