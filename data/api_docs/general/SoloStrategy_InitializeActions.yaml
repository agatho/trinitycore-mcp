  brief: Initializes the solo AI action list for a player character
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up the default combat and non-combat
    actions that a solo player character will use when the AI strategy is activated.
    This method configures the action priority order and ensures all necessary actions
    are registered with the AI system. It typically runs during the initialization
    phase of a solo AI behavior, preparing the character's action queue with appropriate
    melee, ranged, spell casting, and movement actions based on the player's class
    and current game state.

    It is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore AI framework when a solo
    strategy is assigned to a player character.
