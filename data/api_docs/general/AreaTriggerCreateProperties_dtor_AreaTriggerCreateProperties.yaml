documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AreaTriggerCreateProperties object and releases its allocated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the AreaTriggerCreateProperties class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method is automatically invoked when an instance of
    AreaTriggerCreateProperties goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely holds
    properties related to area trigger creation, such as position, radius, duration,
    and other relevant parameters. The destructor ensures proper cleanup to prevent
    memory leaks and maintain system stability during server operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'AreaTriggerCreateProperties* props = new AreaTriggerCreateProperties();

      // ... use props ...

      delete props; // Triggers ~AreaTriggerCreateProperties()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void CreateAndDestroyAreaTrigger()\n{\n    AreaTriggerCreateProperties\
      \ props;\n    // ... use props ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when\
      \ props goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived class objects. Developers should be aware that this method is called
    automatically by the C++ runtime and should not be invoked manually unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime.
