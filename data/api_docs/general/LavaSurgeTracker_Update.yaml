  class: LavaSurgeTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void LavaSurgeTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Lava Surge tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in LavaSurgeTracker is responsible for refreshing
    and maintaining the current state of the Lava Surge buff for a given player bot.
    This method typically checks the player's current spell casting status, buff expiration
    times, and any relevant game mechanics to ensure that the Lava Surge effect is
    properly tracked and managed. It may also handle updating internal timers or flags
    associated with the Lava Surge ability, which is a Shaman class talent that grants
    increased damage for a short duration after casting Lava Burst. The method ensures
    that the bot's behavior aligns with the current state of this buff, affecting
    spell selection and timing decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Lava Surge
      state needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should refer
      to a valid player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LavaSurgeTracker tracker;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate tracking of the Lava Surge buff state. It may internally query the player's
    current spell cooldowns, active buffs, and combat state to determine if the Lava
    Surge effect should be applied or removed.
