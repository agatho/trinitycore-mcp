  method: CancelScene
  signature: void SceneMgr::CancelScene(uint32 sceneInstanceID, bool removeFromMap)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels an active scene instance by its unique identifier.
  description: The CancelScene method terminates an ongoing scene instance within
    the World of Warcraft client, removing it from execution and optionally from the
    map. Scenes in TrinityCore are used to create cinematic effects, scripted events,
    or special visual sequences that play for players. This method allows developers
    to programmatically stop a running scene before its natural completion. The removeFromMap
    parameter controls whether the scene is also removed from the player's current
    map context, which may be necessary if the scene was tied to a specific location
    or zone.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneInstanceID
    description: The unique identifier of the scene instance to cancel. This ID is
      typically generated when the scene is started and is used to reference that
      specific scene execution.
  - name: removeFromMap
    description: If true, removes the scene from the player's map context; if false,
      only stops the scene execution without removing it from the map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cancel a Scene Instance
    code: SceneMgr::CancelScene(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Cancel Scene Without Removing from Map
    code: SceneMgr::CancelScene(sceneId, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on scene instances that are currently active.
    Calling it on a completed or non-existent scene instance may result in undefined
    behavior. The scene instance ID must be valid and correspond to an actual running
    scene.
  warnings: Ensure the sceneInstanceID is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    IDs might cause crashes or unexpected behavior. Also, be cautious when using removeFromMap
    = true, as it could affect other systems that rely on the scene being present
    in the map context.
