documentation:
  brief: Updates the positions of totems controlled by the shaman AI.
  description: The UpdateTotemPositions method is responsible for recalculating and
    adjusting the spatial positioning of all active totems within the shaman's control.
    This method ensures that totems remain properly placed in the world based on the
    shaman's current location, orientation, and any environmental constraints. It
    typically runs during each AI update cycle to maintain proper totem placement
    and prevent them from becoming stuck or misplaced due to movement or terrain changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateTotemPositions();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during each update
    cycle. Developers should not need to call this directly unless implementing custom
    behavior that requires manual totem positioning updates.
