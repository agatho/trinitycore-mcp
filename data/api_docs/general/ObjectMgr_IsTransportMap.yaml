documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified map ID corresponds to a transport map in
    the game world.
  description: The IsTransportMap method checks if a given map ID represents a transport
    map, such as those used for ships, zeppelins, or other moving vehicles in World
    of Warcraft. Transport maps are special map types that are dynamically updated
    and moved through the game world, often containing passengers and changing positions
    over time. This method is typically used by the game engine to identify which
    maps should be treated as transports during movement calculations, pathfinding,
    and object updates. The method performs a lookup in the internal map configuration
    data structure to determine if the provided map ID has transport-specific properties
    enabled.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified map ID corresponds to a transport map; otherwise
    returns false. A transport map is one that contains moving objects like ships
    or flying machines and requires special handling for movement and positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Map is Transport
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsTransportMap(1786)) {\n    // Handle transport-specific\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Map 1786 is a transport map.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Map 1786 is not a transport map.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map configuration data that is loaded at server
    startup. The implementation uses cached data structures for fast lookup, making
    it efficient for frequent calls during gameplay. Developers should be aware that
    transport maps are not static and may have special update requirements.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections of
    code as it involves map configuration lookups. Ensure that the map ID passed is
    valid before calling to avoid potential internal errors or undefined behavior.
