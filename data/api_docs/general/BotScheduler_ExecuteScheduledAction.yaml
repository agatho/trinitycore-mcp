documentation:
  brief: Executes a scheduled action entry for a bot within the TrinityCore AI system.
  description: The ExecuteScheduledAction method processes and runs a scheduled action
    defined by a ScheduleEntry object. This method is typically invoked by the BotScheduler
    to perform timed or condition-based actions for AI-controlled bots in World of
    Warcraft. It ensures that scheduled tasks are executed at the appropriate time
    within the bot's execution cycle, maintaining proper sequencing and timing of
    AI behaviors. The method handles the logic associated with the scheduled action,
    including any necessary state updates or command execution.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A constant reference to a ScheduleEntry object that defines the action
      to be executed, including timing information, action type, and associated data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Executing a scheduled bot action
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      ScheduleEntry entry;

      entry.actionType = BOT_ACTION_MOVE_TO_POSITION;

      entry.delay = 5000; // 5 seconds

      scheduler.ExecuteScheduledAction(entry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the bot's AI execution context
    to ensure proper synchronization. The method assumes that the ScheduleEntry has
    been properly initialized with valid action data and timing information.
