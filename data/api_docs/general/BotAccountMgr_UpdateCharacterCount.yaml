  method: UpdateCharacterCount
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::UpdateCharacterCount(uint32 bnetAccountId, int8 delta)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the character count for a Battle.net account by applying a delta
    value.
  description: The UpdateCharacterCount method adjusts the number of characters associated
    with a specific Battle.net account ID. This function is typically used in bot
    management systems to track and maintain accurate character counts for automated
    accounts. The delta parameter allows incrementing or decrementing the current
    count, enabling fine-grained control over character inventory tracking. The method
    likely interacts with internal data structures or database entries that store
    account character limits and usage statistics.
  parameters:
  - name: bnetAccountId
    description: The unique identifier for the Battle.net account whose character
      count needs to be updated. This is typically a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      the account's ID in the Battle.net system.
  - name: delta
    description: "The change to apply to the character count. Positive values increment\
      \ the count, negative values decrement it. This is an 8-bit signed integer allowing\
      \ for adjustments of up to \xB1127 characters at a time."
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increment character count by one
    code: BotAccountMgr::UpdateCharacterCount(123456, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrement character count by three
    code: BotAccountMgr::UpdateCharacterCount(789012, -3);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's part of a manager class handling
    bot accounts. It may trigger database updates or internal state synchronization
    when called. The implementation might include bounds checking to prevent negative
    character counts.
  warnings: Ensure that the delta value doesn't cause the character count to go below
    zero, which could lead to undefined behavior or data corruption in account management
    systems.
