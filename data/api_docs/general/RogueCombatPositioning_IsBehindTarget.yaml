  method: IsBehindTarget
  signature: bool RogueCombatPositioning::IsBehindTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the rogue is positioned behind the target for optimal
    combat effectiveness.
  description: The IsBehindTarget method evaluates the relative positioning of the
    rogue character in relation to their current combat target. It returns true if
    the rogue is considered to be behind the target, which typically means the rogue
    is within a certain angular threshold (usually 90 degrees) from the target's back,
    allowing for optimal positioning for abilities like Backstab or Cheap Shot. This
    method is crucial for rogues to determine when they can effectively use stealth-based
    attacks that require positional advantage. The method relies on the internal state
    of the rogue's position and orientation relative to the target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rogue is positioned behind the target, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the character's facing direction places them within the
    optimal angular range for back-attack abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (rogueCombatPositioning->IsBehindTarget(targetGuid)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ a backstab or similar ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BACKSTAB,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsBehindTarget(&m_targetGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Prefer stealth-based attacks\n        if (player->HasSpellCooldown(SPELL_BACKSTAB))\
      \ {\n            player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BACKSTAB, true);\n        }\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Move to better position\n        MoveToTarget();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the angle between the rogue's facing direction and
    the vector pointing from the rogue to the target. The exact angular threshold
    for what constitutes 'behind' may vary based on game mechanics and patch updates.
    The method should be called only when a valid target exists.
  warnings: The method signature indicates an int* parameter, which is unusual for
    a const method. This might be a legacy interface or indicate that the method needs
    to access external state through the pointer. Ensure that the target GUID is valid
    before calling this method, as invalid targets may lead to undefined behavior.
