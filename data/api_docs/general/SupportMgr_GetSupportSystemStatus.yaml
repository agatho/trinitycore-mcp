  signature: bool SupportMgr::GetSupportSystemStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks and returns the current status of the support system within the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The GetSupportSystemStatus method is used to determine whether the
    support system functionality is currently enabled or disabled on the TrinityCore
    server. This method typically checks internal flags or configuration settings
    that control the availability of support-related features such as ticketing, customer
    service commands, or administrative tools. The return value indicates the operational
    state of these systems, allowing other components of the server to conditionally
    enable or disable support-related functionality based on this status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the support system is active and operational; otherwise
    returns false if the system is disabled or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Support System Status
    code: "if (sSupportMgr->GetSupportSystemStatus()) {\n    // Support system is\
      \ enabled, proceed with support operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Support system\
      \ is active.\");\n} else {\n    // Support system is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Support system is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently to ensure that support features are
    properly enabled or disabled based on runtime conditions. It may internally query
    configuration files or server state variables, so performance impact is minimal
    but worth noting in high-frequency scenarios.
