  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetSpellVisual
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetSpellVisual(const int & visual)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell visual ID for the area trigger, determining its graphical
    effect appearance.
  description: The SetSpellVisual method assigns a specific spell visual ID to an
    AreaTrigger object, which controls how the area trigger appears to players in
    the game world. This visual ID corresponds to entries in the SpellVisual.dbc file
    and defines effects such as particle systems, aura visuals, or other graphical
    representations associated with the trigger. The method directly modifies the
    internal state of the area trigger and is typically called during the initialization
    or activation of area trigger effects. It's important to note that setting an
    invalid or non-existent visual ID may result in no visual effect being displayed
    to players.
  parameters:
  - name: visual
    description: The spell visual ID to assign to this area trigger. This value must
      correspond to a valid entry in the SpellVisual.dbc database file. A value of
      -1 or 0 typically indicates no visual effect, while positive values reference
      specific visual effects defined in the game's spell visual database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Spell Visual
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      trigger->SetSpellVisual(12345);

      // This assigns spell visual ID 12345 to the area trigger, which will display
      the corresponding graphical effect when active.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Visual Effect
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(1234);

      trigger->SetSpellVisual(0);

      // This removes any visual effect from the area trigger, effectively making
      it invisible to players.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the AreaTrigger object and should
    be called before or during the trigger's activation. The visual ID must exist
    in the SpellVisual.dbc database file; otherwise, no visual effect will be shown.
    This method does not validate the existence of the visual ID at runtime.
  warnings: Using an invalid spell visual ID (e.g., one that doesn't exist in SpellVisual.dbc)
    may cause the area trigger to display no visual effect or potentially crash if
    the system attempts to render a non-existent visual. Always ensure that the provided
    visual ID is valid before calling this method.
