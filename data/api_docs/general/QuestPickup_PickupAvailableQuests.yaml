  class: QuestPickup
  method: PickupAvailableQuests
  signature: void QuestPickup::PickupAvailableQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and assigns available quests to a specified player character.
  description: The PickupAvailableQuests method iterates through all available quests
    in the game world and attempts to assign them to the provided player character.
    This method is typically used by AI systems or quest automation tools to ensure
    that players receive appropriate quest assignments based on their level, location,
    and quest availability. The method checks for quest prerequisites, player requirements,
    and quest state before assigning quests. It does not validate whether the player
    can actually accept the quest; it simply processes available quests that meet
    basic criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character that will
      receive the available quests. Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup for Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.PickupAvailableQuests(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automated Quest Assignment in AI System
    code: "void AssignAvailableQuestsToBot(Player* bot)\n{\n    if (bot && bot->IsInWorld())\n\
      \    {\n        QuestPickup questPickup;\n        questPickup.PickupAvailableQuests(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in automated quest systems or AI bots. It does
    not handle quest completion or tracking; it only assigns quests that are available
    for pickup. The method may be called multiple times during a player's session,
    but should not be invoked on players who are not in the world to avoid potential
    crashes.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is valid and in the game world before
    invoking this method. This method does not perform any quest validation beyond
    basic availability checks.
