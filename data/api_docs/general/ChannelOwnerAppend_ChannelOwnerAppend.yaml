  class: ChannelOwnerAppend
  method: ChannelOwnerAppend
  signature: void ChannelOwnerAppend::ChannelOwnerAppend(const Channel * channel,
    const int & ownerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a channel owner to the specified channel.
  description: The ChannelOwnerAppend method is responsible for adding a new owner
    to a given channel within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that
    the specified player GUID is registered as an owner of the provided channel, allowing
    them to manage channel settings and permissions. The operation typically occurs
    during channel creation or when granting ownership privileges to players. It's
    part of the core channel management system that maintains ownership hierarchies
    for in-game communication channels.
  parameters:
  - name: channel
    description: Pointer to the Channel object that will receive the new owner. Must
      be a valid channel instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: ownerGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become
      an owner of the channel. Should represent a valid player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Player as Channel Owner
    code: "Channel* myChannel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif\
      \ (myChannel)\n{\n    ChannelOwnerAppend(myChannel, player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal channel owner lists and may trigger
    updates to channel permissions. It's important to ensure that the channel object
    is valid before calling this method to prevent memory access violations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid channel pointer or a non-existent
    player GUID can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs
    before invoking this function.
