  brief: Logs movement statistics for debugging and performance analysis.
  description: The LogStatistics method outputs detailed movement-related metrics
    and performance data to the server logs. This includes information about pathfinding
    operations, movement updates, and potential bottlenecks in the movement system.
    The method is typically used during development or troubleshooting to identify
    issues with NPC or player movement behavior. It does not modify any internal state
    and serves purely for diagnostic purposes.

  notes: This method should only be called during development or debugging sessions
    as it may produce verbose output. It is not intended for regular runtime use due
    to performance overhead from logging.
