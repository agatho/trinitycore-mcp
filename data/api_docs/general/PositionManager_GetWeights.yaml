  class: PositionManager
  method: GetWeights
  signature: const PositionWeights & PositionManager::GetWeights() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current position weights configuration used by the PositionManager
    for pathfinding and movement calculations.
  description: The GetWeights method retrieves a constant reference to the PositionWeights
    structure that defines the weighting factors applied during position evaluation
    within the PositionManager. These weights are crucial for determining optimal
    movement paths, threat assessment, and positioning decisions in AI behavior. The
    returned reference provides access to internal weight values such as distance
    penalties, threat levels, and other positional modifiers without allowing modification
    of the underlying data. This method is typically invoked during pathfinding operations
    or when evaluating potential positions for NPC movement or combat positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PositionWeights object containing the current
    weighting configuration used by the PositionManager for movement calculations
    and position evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Position Weights for Debugging
    code: 'const PositionWeights& weights = positionManager.GetWeights();

      float distanceWeight = weights.distanceWeight;

      float threatWeight = weights.threatWeight;

      // Use weights for debugging or logging purposes'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Weights in Custom AI Logic
    code: 'PositionManager* manager = unit->GetAI()->GetPositionManager();

      const PositionWeights& weights = manager->GetWeights();

      float calculatedValue = position.GetDistance() * weights.distanceWeight + threatLevel
      * weights.threatWeight;

      // Apply custom logic using retrieved weights'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PositionWeights reference points to internal data managed by
    the PositionManager. Modifications to the weights should be done through dedicated
    setter methods rather than direct access to avoid inconsistent state. This method
    is thread-safe as it only returns a constant reference without modifying any internal
    state.
  warnings: Accessing the weights directly through this getter does not provide write
    access, but care must be taken when using these values in calculations that may
    affect AI behavior or pathfinding decisions. The weights should not be modified
    externally as they are managed internally by the PositionManager.
