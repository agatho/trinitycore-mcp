  brief: Retrieves and processes guild rank information for the player's current guild.
  description: The HandleGuildGetRanks method is responsible for handling client requests
    to fetch the list of ranks within a player's guild. When invoked, it typically
    retrieves the guild's rank structure including rank names, permissions, and associated
    privileges. This method is part of the WorldSession class and is triggered by
    a specific packet sent from the client. It ensures that the player's client has
    up-to-date information about their guild hierarchy and permissions. The method
    may also validate the player's access level to ensure they are authorized to view
    rank details.

  - title: Basic Usage in WorldSession Context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildGetRanks(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildGetRanks&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Process the request to get guild ranks\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->SendGuildRankInfo(this);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player opens their guild roster or
    rank management interface in the game client. It should only be invoked for players
    who are members of a guild. The implementation may involve database queries to
    fetch rank data and packet serialization to send the information back to the client.
