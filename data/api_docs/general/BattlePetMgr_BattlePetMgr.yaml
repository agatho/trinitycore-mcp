documentation:
  brief: Moves a BattlePetMgr object to another BattlePetMgr object using move semantics.
  description: The BattlePetMgr move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from one BattlePetMgr instance to another. This constructor is typically used
    when a BattlePetMgr object needs to be moved rather than copied, which can improve
    performance by avoiding unnecessary deep copies. The source object is left in
    a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this would be relevant for managing battle pet data
    structures efficiently during gameplay operations such as pet transfers between
    containers or when handling temporary pet instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a BattlePetMgr
    code: 'BattlePetMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with battle pet data ...

      BattlePetMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor invoked

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows standard C++ move semantics. After the move, the
    original object should not be used unless it's explicitly reset or reassigned.
    The implementation likely involves transferring internal pointers or handles rather
    than copying large data structures.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the source object
    post-move unless it's properly reinitialized.
