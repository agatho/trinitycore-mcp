documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of bank tabs available to the player's account.
  description: This method configures the total number of bank tabs that can be accessed
    by the player's account. It determines how many bank tab slots are available for
    use, which affects the player's ability to store items in their bank. The method
    is typically used during account initialization or when modifying account bank
    settings. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    players have appropriate access to their account's banking resources.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of bank tabs to set for the account. Valid values range
      from 0 to 127, with 0 meaning no bank tabs available and higher values allowing
      more tabs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Bank Tab Count
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetAccountBankTabCount(5);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Bank Tab Count to Zero
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetAccountBankTabCount(0);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects the account's bank tab configuration in the database
    and may require a reload of the account data. The implementation probably involves
    updating internal account state variables that control bank tab access.
  warnings: Setting this value to zero will prevent the player from accessing any
    bank tabs, which may impact gameplay if they have items stored there. Be cautious
    when modifying this value as it affects all bank tab functionality for the account.
