documentation:
  brief: Loads race, class, and gender overrides for bot character distribution.
  description: This method initializes and loads configuration data that defines how
    bot characters are distributed across different races, classes, and genders. It
    typically reads from database tables or configuration files to determine the probability
    weights for each combination of race, class, and gender when creating new bot
    characters. The loaded overrides allow for customizing the distribution of bot
    characters in a World of Warcraft server using TrinityCore, enabling server administrators
    to control the demographic makeup of AI-controlled players. This method is usually
    called during server initialization or when configuration changes are detected.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution distribution;

      distribution.LoadRaceClassGenderOverrides();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to fetch override configurations
    and may cache the results for performance. It should be called before attempting
    to generate bot characters to ensure proper distribution settings are in place.
