  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: TurnInCompletedQuests
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::TurnInCompletedQuests(Creature * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Turns in all completed quests for the specified quest giver creature.
  description: The TurnInCompletedQuests method processes and turns in all quests
    that have been completed by the player and are eligible for submission to the
    given quest giver creature. This method iterates through the player's active quests,
    identifies those that are marked as complete, and attempts to turn them in with
    the specified NPC. It handles quest completion validation, reward distribution,
    and updates the quest state in the player's quest log. The method ensures proper
    quest progression and maintains consistency with the game's quest system mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC that will receive
      and process the completed quests. Must be a valid creature instance with quest-giving
      capabilities.
  returns: Returns true if at least one quest was successfully turned in, or false
    if no eligible quests were found or if all quests failed to turn in properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->TurnInCompletedQuests(questGiver))\
      \ {\n    // Quests were turned in successfully\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quests turned in successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // No quests to turn in or\
      \ all failed\n    player->SendNotification(\"No quests available to turn in.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (questGiver && questGiver->IsQuestGiver()) {\n    bool result = player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->TurnInCompletedQuests(questGiver);\n\
      \    if (result) {\n        // Process successful turn-in\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverOfferReward(questGiver,\
      \ true);\n    } else {\n        // Handle case where no quests were turned in\n\
      \        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverHello(questGiver);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is interacting with a valid
    quest giver NPC. The method assumes that all necessary preconditions for quest
    completion have already been validated. It may trigger additional quest-related
    events and updates to the player's quest log.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the questGiver parameter
    is a valid Creature instance with quest-giving capabilities. Calling this method
    in inappropriate contexts may lead to undefined behavior or quest progression
    issues.
