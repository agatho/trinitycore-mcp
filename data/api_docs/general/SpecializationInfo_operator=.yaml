  brief: Assigns the contents of another SpecializationInfo object to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for SpecializationInfo performs a deep copy
    of all member data from the source SpecializationInfo object to the current object.
    This method is used to replace the contents of one specialization information
    structure with another, ensuring that all internal state is properly transferred.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this would typically be used
    when updating or switching player specializations, where each specialization contains
    information about talents, glyphs, and other class-specific abilities. The operation
    returns a reference to the current object to allow for chaining assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpecializationInfo object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current SpecializationInfo object, allowing for assignment
    chaining operations such as obj1 = obj2 = obj3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'SpecializationInfo spec1;

      SpecializationInfo spec2;

      // ... populate spec2 with data ...

      spec1 = spec2; // Assigns all contents of spec2 to spec1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment Chaining
    code: 'SpecializationInfo spec1, spec2, spec3;

      // ... populate spec2 and spec3 with data ...

      spec1 = spec2 = spec3; // Chains multiple assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely handles memory management internally to ensure proper
    copying of any dynamically allocated data within the SpecializationInfo structure.
    It should be used carefully when dealing with large specialization data sets as
    it may involve significant memory operations.
