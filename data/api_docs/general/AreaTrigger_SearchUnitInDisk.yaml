  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SearchUnitInDisk
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SearchUnitInDisk(const int & disk, int & targetList)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for units within a specified disk area around the AreaTrigger's
    position and populates a target list.
  description: The SearchUnitInDisk method performs a radial search for nearby units
    within a defined disk-shaped area centered on the AreaTrigger's current position.
    It evaluates all units in the surrounding area and adds those that meet certain
    criteria to the provided target list. This functionality is commonly used in area-based
    spells or effects where the system needs to identify and process units within
    a specific radius. The method operates synchronously and affects the provided
    target list parameter directly, making it suitable for implementing targeted area-of-effect
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: disk
    description: An integer value representing the radius of the disk-shaped search
      area in yards. This determines how far from the AreaTrigger's position units
      will be considered as potential targets.
  - name: targetList
    description: A reference to an integer that serves as a container for storing
      the number of units found within the specified disk area. The method updates
      this value with the count of matching units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SearchUnitInDisk
    code: 'int diskRadius = 10;

      int targetCount = 0;

      areaTrigger->SearchUnitInDisk(diskRadius, targetCount);

      // targetCount now holds the number of units within a 10-yard radius'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SearchUnitInDisk in spell effect processing
    code: "void SpellEffectHandler(AreaTrigger* trigger) {\n    int diskRadius = 15;\n\
      \    int targetCount = 0;\n    trigger->SearchUnitInDisk(diskRadius, targetCount);\n\
      \    if (targetCount > 0) {\n        // Apply damage or effect to targets\n\
      \        trigger->ApplyEffectToTargets(targetCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the processing of area triggers, such
    as those used in spells like 'Circle of Healing' or 'Blizzard'. The disk radius
    parameter directly influences performance, so large values should be used judiciously.
    The method does not return a list of units but instead updates an integer count,
    which may require additional logic to retrieve actual unit references.
  warnings: Ensure that the disk radius is properly validated before calling this
    method to prevent excessive computational overhead or unintended behavior. Be
    cautious when using very large disk values in high-traffic areas as it can significantly
    impact server performance.
