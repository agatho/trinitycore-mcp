  method: GetTotalMLMemoryUsage
  signature: uint64_t MLPerformanceTracker::GetTotalMLMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of machine learning components
    within the performance tracker.
  description: The GetTotalMLMemoryUsage method aggregates memory consumption across
    all registered machine learning models and operations tracked by the MLPerformanceTracker
    instance. This method provides a comprehensive view of how much memory is currently
    being utilized by ML-related processes in the system. The returned value represents
    the cumulative memory footprint in bytes, which can be used for performance monitoring,
    resource allocation decisions, or identifying potential memory leaks within the
    machine learning subsystem. This method is typically called during performance
    profiling sessions or when monitoring system resources to ensure optimal operation
    of ML features.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes consumed
    by all machine learning components tracked by this instance. Returns zero if no
    ML components are registered or if memory tracking is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint64_t totalMemory = tracker.GetTotalMLMemoryUsage();

      std::cout << "Total ML Memory Usage: " << totalMemory << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void MonitorMLPerformance() {\n    static MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n\
      \    uint64_t memoryUsage = tracker.GetTotalMLMemoryUsage();\n    if (memoryUsage\
      \ > MAX_ALLOWED_MEMORY) {\n        // Trigger memory cleanup or warning\n  \
      \      LOG_WARN(\"ML Memory usage exceeded threshold: %llu bytes\", memoryUsage);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a summation of individual component memory usages, so
    it may have performance implications if called frequently. The memory tracking
    must be enabled for accurate results. This method is thread-safe as long as the
    underlying ML components are properly synchronized.
  warnings: The returned value represents only tracked memory usage and may not include
    memory allocated outside of the performance tracker's scope. Frequent calls to
    this method in performance-critical sections may introduce overhead.
