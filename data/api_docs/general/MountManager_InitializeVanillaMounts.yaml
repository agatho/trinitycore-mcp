documentation:
  brief: Initializes the vanilla mount database entries for all applicable player
    characters in the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The InitializeVanillaMounts method sets up and registers all default
    mount entries that are available in the original Vanilla World of Warcraft expansion.
    This function is typically invoked during server startup or when a new character
    is created to ensure that players have access to their starting mounts. It populates
    internal data structures with predefined mount information including display IDs,
    spell IDs, and availability conditions. The method ensures consistency across
    all realms by applying standard mount definitions regardless of player level or
    faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: MountManager::InitializeVanillaMounts();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in duplicate mount entries or unexpected behavior. The function
    operates synchronously and blocks execution until completion.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually during gameplay as it can cause inconsistencies
    in player mount data. This function is intended for internal use by the TrinityCore
    framework during server bootstrapping.
