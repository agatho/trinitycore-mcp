  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsPathfindingComplete
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsPathfindingComplete(uint32 requestId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the pathfinding request with the specified ID has completed.
  description: The IsPathfindingComplete method determines if a previously initiated
    pathfinding operation identified by the given request ID has finished processing.
    This is typically used in conjunction with asynchronous pathfinding operations
    where the client needs to know when results are available. The method returns
    true if the pathfinding task is complete, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, this method helps manage the state of AI pathfinding
    tasks for creatures and NPCs, ensuring that path computations are not queried
    before they are ready.
  parameters:
  - name: requestId
    description: A unique identifier for a specific pathfinding request. This ID is
      typically generated when initiating a pathfinding operation and must be valid
      and previously registered within the PathfindingManager.
  returns: Returns true if the pathfinding request with the specified ID has completed
    processing, false otherwise. If the requestId does not correspond to any active
    or previously initiated pathfinding task, the behavior is undefined and may result
    in incorrect return values or exceptions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IsPathfindingComplete
    code: "uint32 requestId = sPathfinder->StartPathfinding(...);\nif (sPathfinder->IsPathfindingComplete(requestId))\
      \ {\n    // Process completed path\n    std::vector<Position> path = sPathfinder->GetPath(requestId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Polling for pathfinding completion
    code: "uint32 requestId = sPathfinder->StartPathfinding(...);\nwhile (!sPathfinder->IsPathfindingComplete(requestId))\
      \ {\n    // Wait or perform other tasks\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));\n\
      }\n// Path is now complete\nstd::vector<Position> path = sPathfinder->GetPath(requestId);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve locking or checking internal state. The underlying implementation
    likely uses atomic operations or mutexes to ensure thread safety when checking
    the completion status of pathfinding tasks.
  warnings: Using an invalid requestId can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure
    that the request ID corresponds to a valid and active pathfinding task before
    calling this method. Additionally, polling this method in tight loops without
    delays may cause unnecessary CPU usage.
