  signature: void CreatureTemplate::~CreatureTemplate()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CreatureTemplate instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The CreatureTemplate destructor is automatically invoked when a CreatureTemplate
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of memory and resources allocated for the creature template, including
    any dynamically allocated data structures or cached information. In TrinityCore's
    architecture, CreatureTemplate objects are typically managed by the game server's
    internal systems and are not directly instantiated or destroyed by scripts or
    modules. The destructor performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory
    leaks and maintain system stability.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CreatureTemplate
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    // CreatureTemplate is created internally\
      \ by TrinityCore\n    // When it goes out of scope, destructor is automatically\
      \ called\n    if (someCondition)\n    {\n        CreatureTemplate* tempTemplate\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n        // Do something with tempTemplate\n\
      \        // Destructor called automatically when tempTemplate goes out of scope\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. CreatureTemplate objects are typically cached and managed by
    the ObjectMgr system, so manual destruction is rare. The destructor ensures that
    any internal references or pointers within the template are properly cleaned up
    to prevent dangling references.
