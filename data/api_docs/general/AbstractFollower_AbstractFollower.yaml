  class: AbstractFollower
  method: AbstractFollower
  signature: void AbstractFollower::AbstractFollower(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AbstractFollower instance with the specified target unit.
  description: The AbstractFollower constructor initializes a new follower object,
    setting its internal target to the provided Unit pointer. This method is typically
    used in the context of AI behavior systems where creatures or NPCs need to follow
    specific targets. The target unit may represent a player, another NPC, or any
    game entity that can be followed. The constructor performs basic initialization
    and validation of the target parameter to ensure it's a valid Unit instance before
    assigning it to the follower's internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this follower will track and follow.
      Must be a valid pointer to a Unit instance, or nullptr if no target is initially
      assigned.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization with Player Target
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      AbstractFollower* follower = new AbstractFollower(player);

      // The follower now tracks the player unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Null Target
    code: 'AbstractFollower* follower = new AbstractFollower(nullptr);

      // Creates a follower without an initial target'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the base class for all follower AI implementations
    in TrinityCore. It's important to note that the target Unit pointer should remain
    valid throughout the lifetime of the AbstractFollower instance, as no automatic
    reference counting or cleanup occurs on the target.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or deleted Unit pointer to this constructor will result
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure the target Unit is alive and valid before
    creating an AbstractFollower with it.
