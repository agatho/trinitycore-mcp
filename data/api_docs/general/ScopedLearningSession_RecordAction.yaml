  class: ScopedLearningSession
  method: RecordAction
  signature: void ScopedLearningSession::RecordAction(const std::string & action,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records a learning action and its success status within the scoped learning
    session.
  description: The RecordAction method logs a specific action performed during a learning
    session, along with whether the action was successful. This method is typically
    used in the context of player behavior analysis or AI-driven learning systems
    within the game. It allows tracking of actions taken by players and their outcomes
    to improve learning algorithms or game mechanics. The method does not return any
    value but updates internal session state for later retrieval or processing.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: A string identifier representing the action that was performed during
      the learning session. This should be a descriptive label that uniquely identifies
      the type of action taken.
  - name: success
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the recorded action was successful
      (true) or failed (false). This value is used to evaluate learning outcomes and
      adjust behavior accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ScopedLearningSession session;

      // Record a successful action

      session.RecordAction("Jump", true);

      // Record a failed action

      session.RecordAction("Climb", false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Game Context
    code: "void Player::HandleLearningAction(const std::string& actionType) {\n  \
      \  bool success = CheckActionSuccess(actionType);\n    learningSession->RecordAction(actionType,\
      \ success);\n    if (!success) {\n        // Handle failure case\n        LOG_ERROR(\"\
      Player\", \"Failed to perform action: %s\", actionType.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a scoped learning session, implying that it's tied
    to a specific context or time period. The internal implementation likely stores
    these records for later analysis or feedback loops in AI systems. Ensure that
    action identifiers are consistent and meaningful across the application to maintain
    data integrity.
