  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: AttackBase
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::AttackBase(GameObject * flag)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an attack on the specified GameObject flag within the AdvancedBehaviorManager's
    AI framework.
  description: The AttackBase method is a core function of the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    class designed to trigger combat behavior against a specified GameObject flag.
    This method typically serves as part of a larger AI system that governs how game
    entities respond to objectives or triggers in World of Warcraft scenarios. The
    method likely sets internal state flags, initiates movement toward the target,
    and may engage combat mechanics such as threat generation or enemy targeting.
    It is commonly used in quest-based or objective-driven AI behaviors where an entity
    must react to a specific GameObject marker or flag.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A pointer to the GameObject that represents the target flag or objective
      to attack. This parameter must be a valid GameObject instance; passing nullptr
      may result in undefined behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObject* flag = player->GetGameObjectAtMap(1234);\nif (flag)\n{\n  \
      \  advancedBehaviorManager->AttackBase(flag);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Checking
    code: "if (flag && flag->IsInWorld())\n{\n    advancedBehaviorManager->AttackBase(flag);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid flag or out-of-world condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within AI update loops or event handlers.
    It assumes the GameObject pointer is valid and in the world. The actual combat
    behavior may depend on other AI states, such as whether the entity is already
    engaged in combat or has line-of-sight to the target.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'flag' can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the GameObject exists and is valid before calling this method. Also,
    be cautious of calling AttackBase during AI state transitions, as it may interfere
    with existing combat logic.
