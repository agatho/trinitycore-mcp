  brief: Resets all tracking metrics and counters used by the leader-follow behavior
    AI.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all internal tracking data and performance
    counters associated with the LeaderFollowBehavior AI module. This includes resetting
    any accumulated statistics, timers, or state variables that monitor the behavior's
    execution. The method is typically invoked when transitioning between different
    AI states or when reinitializing the behavior after a period of inactivity. It
    ensures clean state management for subsequent operations without carrying over
    stale data from previous executions.

  notes: This method should be called before reinitializing the behavior or when switching
    between different leader-follow configurations to ensure accurate performance
    tracking and prevent data contamination.
