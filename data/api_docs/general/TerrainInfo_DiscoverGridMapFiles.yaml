  brief: Scans and identifies available grid map files for terrain data in the World
    of Warcraft instance.
  description: The DiscoverGridMapFiles method is responsible for scanning the game's
    file system to locate and identify all available grid map files that contain terrain
    data for different regions within a World of Warcraft instance. This method typically
    runs during server startup or when terrain data needs to be dynamically loaded,
    ensuring that the server has knowledge of which map files are accessible for loading
    into memory. It plays a crucial role in the dynamic loading of world maps and
    terrain information, particularly in TrinityCore's implementation where map data
    is organized per grid tile. The method does not load the actual map data but rather
    discovers and catalogs the presence of these files to be used later by other subsystems
    such as the MapManager or GridMap loader.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo();

      // This method is typically called internally during server startup

      // to discover available map files

      terrain->DiscoverGridMapFiles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked before any grid map loading operations begin.
    It's usually part of the initialization sequence and may perform file system scans
    that could impact startup time on servers with large numbers of map files. The
    discovered files are stored internally within the TerrainInfo object for later
    retrieval.
