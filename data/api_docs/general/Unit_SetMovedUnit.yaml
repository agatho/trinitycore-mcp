documentation:
  brief: Sets the target unit for movement tracking.
  description: This method establishes a relationship between the current unit and
    a target unit for movement purposes. It typically sets up the unit to follow or
    track another unit's movement, which is commonly used in AI behavior for controlling
    unit movement patterns. The method affects how the unit moves within the game
    world and can be used to control unit positioning during combat or non-combat
    situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The unit that will be set as the target for movement tracking. This
      parameter determines which unit the current unit will follow or track.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      Unit* source = new Unit();

      source->SetMovedUnit(target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect the unit's movement
    behavior in combat situations. It is often used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to control AI behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected movement behavior or
    even movement loops. Always ensure that the target unit is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method.
