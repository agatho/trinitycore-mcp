  method: ShouldKite
  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ShouldKite(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the marksmanship hunter should kite enemies based on current
    combat state and positioning.
  description: The ShouldKite method evaluates the current combat situation for a
    marksmanship hunter to decide if kiting (moving while attacking) is beneficial.
    This decision is typically based on factors such as enemy proximity, hunter's
    health, mana levels, and positioning relative to terrain or obstacles. Kiting
    allows the hunter to maintain distance from melee enemies while continuing to
    deal damage, which is crucial for survival in high-damage encounters. The method
    returns true when kiting behavior should be initiated, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is integral to the AI's decision-making process during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should begin kiting enemies; returns false if
    kiting is not recommended or beneficial at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldKite()) {\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n    hunter->StartKiting();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateCombat()\n{\n    if (ShouldKite())\n\
      \    {\n        MoveToSafeDistance();\n        AttackTarget();\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // Normal combat behavior\n        AimAndShoot();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state tracking such as health
    percentage, mana reserves, and enemy distance. It may also consider environmental
    factors like terrain or available escape routes. The implementation should be
    efficient since it's called frequently during combat updates.
  warnings: Ensure that kiting decisions are not made in isolation; they should account
    for the hunter's overall tactical situation including threat management and positioning.
    Incorrectly enabling kiting in close-quarters combat can lead to unnecessary damage
    taken or missed opportunities to deal damage.
