  class: Unit
  method: SetStunned
  signature: void Unit::SetStunned(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Stuns the unit, preventing movement and actions.
  description: The SetStunned method applies or removes a stun effect on the target
    unit, which prevents the unit from moving, attacking, or performing any actions.
    This method is commonly used in game mechanics to control enemy behavior during
    combat, particularly in boss fights or when implementing special abilities. The
    stun effect typically lasts until the unit is removed or until the duration expires,
    depending on how it's implemented.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: Determines whether to apply or remove the stun effect. True applies
      the stun, false removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Stun Application
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      target->SetStunned(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stun Removal Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      target->SetStunned(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other control methods like
    SetControlled or SetRooted to fully restrict unit movement. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific game mechanics being applied, such as in boss
    encounters or scripted events.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to game-breaking behavior if not
    properly handled. It should be used carefully during combat scenarios to avoid
    unintended consequences.
