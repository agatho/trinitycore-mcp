  class: GuildBankManager
  method: WithdrawCraftingMaterials
  signature: void GuildBankManager::WithdrawCraftingMaterials(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Withdraws crafting materials from the guild bank for a specified player.
  description: The WithdrawCraftingMaterials method allows a player to retrieve crafting
    materials stored in the guild bank. This functionality is typically used when
    players need to access resources required for crafting items, such as herbs, ores,
    or other components. The method handles the validation of player permissions and
    ensures that the requested items are available in the guild's inventory before
    processing the withdrawal. It also updates the guild bank's item counts and may
    trigger notifications or logging depending on server configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is attempting to withdraw crafting materials from the guild bank.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.WithdrawCraftingMaterials(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild bank's internal storage system
    and may require the player to have appropriate permissions (e.g., guild master
    or officer status) to perform withdrawals. The actual implementation details regarding
    item validation, transaction handling, and synchronization are not visible in
    the provided signature.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper player GUID validation could
    lead to incorrect inventory manipulations or security vulnerabilities. Ensure
    that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player before calling
    this function.
