  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetCasterGUID
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetCasterGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the unit that cast the dynamic object spell.
  description: The GetCasterGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    unit that originally cast the spell that created this dynamic object. This is
    typically used in spell effects that create persistent or area-of-effect objects,
    such as traps, summons, or environmental effects. The returned GUID can be used
    to identify the caster for various game mechanics including targeting, ownership
    tracking, and spell interaction logic. The method does not perform any validation
    on whether the caster still exists in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the caster unit. This value is typically
    a 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies the casting unit within the game
    world context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to identify caster
    code: "void HandleDynamicObjectUpdate(DynamicObject* dynObj)\n{\n    uint32 casterGUID\
      \ = dynObj->GetCasterGUID();\n    if (Player* caster = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(casterGUID))\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform actions based on the caster\n        caster->SendNotification(\"\
      You cast this spell!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell effect handlers and dynamic object
    update routines. The returned GUID may be invalid if the caster has left the game
    world or been destroyed, so callers should validate the existence of the referenced
    unit before using it.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without validating that the caster
    still exists in the world. Using an invalid GUID can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior when attempting to access the caster object.
