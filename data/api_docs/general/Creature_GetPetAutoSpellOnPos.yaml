  signature: uint32 Creature::GetPetAutoSpellOnPos(uint8 pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID of the auto spell at the specified position for a creature's
    pet.
  description: This method retrieves the spell ID that is automatically cast by a
    creature's pet at the given position. The method is typically used in conjunction
    with pet AI behavior to determine which spell should be triggered when a pet performs
    an action. It is part of the creature's pet management system and allows developers
    to access specific auto-spell data for creatures that have pets. This method does
    not modify any state but rather retrieves information from internal storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell ID associated with the auto spell at the specified position,
    or 0 if no spell is set at that position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 spellId = creature->GetPetAutoSpellOnPos(0);\nif (spellId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Do something with the spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's pet auto-spell system and should be
    used carefully when dealing with pet AI logic. The position parameter corresponds
    to a specific index in the pet's auto spell list, which may vary depending on
    how the pet was configured.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding the pet's
    auto-spell configuration. Using incorrect positions can lead to invalid spell
    IDs or unexpected behavior.
