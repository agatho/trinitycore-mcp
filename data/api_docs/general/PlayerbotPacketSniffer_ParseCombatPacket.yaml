  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseCombatPacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseCombatPacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Parses incoming combat-related packets from players to extract and process
    combat data for bot behavior analysis.
  description: The ParseCombatPacket method is responsible for intercepting and analyzing
    combat-related World of Warcraft packets sent by players. It processes these packets
    to gather information about player actions, such as attacks, spells, and abilities
    used during combat. This functionality is crucial for playerbot AI systems that
    need to understand the current state of combat to make informed decisions. The
    method typically operates within the context of a packet sniffer system that monitors
    network traffic between clients and the server. It may update internal data structures
    or trigger events based on the parsed combat information, enabling bots to respond
    appropriately to changing battlefield conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      that sent the packet. This parameter provides access to session-specific data
      and allows for communication back to the client if needed.
  - name: packet
    description: Reference to the WorldPacket object containing the raw combat data
      received from the player. The packet structure contains serialized combat information
      including action types, targets, damage values, and timing data.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Parsing Usage
    code: "void MyCombatHandler::HandleCombatPacket(WorldSession* session, const WorldPacket&\
      \ packet) {\n    PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;\n    sniffer.ParseCombatPacket(session,\
      \ packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI System
    code: "class CombatAnalyzer {\npublic:\n    void ProcessCombatData(WorldSession*\
      \ session, const WorldPacket& packet) {\n        PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;\n\
      \        sniffer.ParseCombatPacket(session, packet);\n        // Update bot's\
      \ combat state based on parsed data\n        UpdateBotBehavior();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of a network packet interception
    system. Developers should be aware that parsing combat packets requires understanding
    of World of Warcraft's packet structure and may involve significant processing
    overhead depending on the complexity of the combat data being analyzed.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying or extending this method, as incorrect
    parsing of combat packets could lead to unexpected behavior in bot AI systems.
    The method assumes valid packet data and does not perform extensive validation
    checks.
