  signature: float ThreatCoordinator::GetGroupThreatStability() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the stability factor of threat distribution within
    a group.
  description: The GetGroupThreatStability method evaluates how evenly threat is distributed
    among group members in the context of combat. This metric is used by the ThreatCoordinator
    to determine optimal threat management strategies, such as when to redistribute
    threat or when to switch targets. The stability factor is typically a floating-point
    value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates highly imbalanced threat distribution
    (one member has most of the threat) and 1.0 indicates perfectly balanced distribution.
    This method considers each group member's current threat level relative to others
    in the group and returns a normalized score reflecting overall group stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the stability of threat
    distribution within the group. Values closer to 1.0 indicate more balanced threat
    distribution, while values closer to 0.0 indicate significant imbalance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float stability = threatCoordinator->GetGroupThreatStability();\nif (stability\
      \ < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Group has highly imbalanced threat; consider threat redistribution\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"threat\", \"High threat imbalance detected: {}\", stability);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Threat Stability Over Time
    code: "float previousStability = threatCoordinator->GetGroupThreatStability();\n\
      // ... combat actions occur ...\nfloat currentStability = threatCoordinator->GetGroupThreatStability();\n\
      if (currentStability < previousStability)\n{\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"threat\", \"Threat\
      \ stability decreased from {} to {}\", previousStability, currentStability);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and may involve calculations
    based on the threat levels of all group members. The implementation likely uses
    statistical methods to compute variance or standard deviation of threat values
    across the group members. The value returned should be interpreted in context
    of the current combat situation and group composition.
  warnings: The returned value is only meaningful when used in the context of a valid
    group with active combat engagement. Calling this method outside of combat may
    return misleading results due to lack of threat data. Additionally, frequent calls
    to this method may have performance implications during high-frequency combat
    updates.
