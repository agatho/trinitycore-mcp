  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: AdjustQuestRewards
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AdjustQuestRewards(uint32 questId, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts quest rewards for a specified player based on dynamic system rules.
  description: The AdjustQuestRewards method modifies the rewards associated with
    a given quest for a specific player. This functionality is typically used in dynamic
    quest systems where rewards may be adjusted based on player level, faction, quest
    completion history, or other game mechanics. The method ensures that players receive
    appropriate and balanced rewards according to the system's logic. It does not
    directly modify the quest data itself but rather adjusts how rewards are presented
    or calculated for the specific player instance.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose rewards need to be adjusted.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the quest rewards are being
      adjusted. This player must be valid and connected to the server.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      questSystem.AdjustQuestRewards(12345, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Reward Modification Logic
    code: "DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player\
      \ pointer\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nquestSystem.AdjustQuestRewards(questId,\
      \ player);\n// Additional logic to process modified rewards\nif (player->GetQuestRewardMoney(questId)\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    player->ModifyMoney(player->GetQuestRewardMoney(questId));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the quest exists and
    the player is valid. It assumes that reward adjustments are handled internally
    by the system and does not perform direct database updates. The method may trigger
    additional internal callbacks or events related to quest reward processing.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or null player pointer can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of inputs before
    invoking this function. Also, be cautious when using this in high-frequency scenarios
    as it might impact performance if not optimized properly.
