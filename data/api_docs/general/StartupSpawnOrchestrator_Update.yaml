  method: Update
  signature: void StartupSpawnOrchestrator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the startup spawn orchestrator state based on elapsed time
  description: The Update method of the StartupSpawnOrchestrator class processes and
    manages the spawning of game objects during server startup. It handles the scheduling
    and execution of spawn operations that occur during the initialization phase of
    the TrinityCore server. This method is typically called from the main game loop
    and uses the provided time delta to determine when to trigger spawn events, ensuring
    proper sequencing and timing of object creation during server bootstrapping.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed since the last update call in milliseconds. This
      value is used to determine if spawn delays have been met and to progress the
      spawning sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    sStartupSpawnOrchestrator->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization and should
    only be called after the server has entered the active state. The orchestrator
    maintains internal state about which objects have been spawned and when to spawn
    the next batch.
