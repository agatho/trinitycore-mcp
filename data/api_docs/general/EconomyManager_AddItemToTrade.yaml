  brief: Adds an item to the economy manager's trade inventory
  description: The AddItemToTrade method is used to add a specified item to the EconomyManager's
    internal trade inventory system. This method is typically invoked when a player
    wishes to offer an item for trade or when an item needs to be registered within
    the economy system for trading purposes. The method performs validation checks
    on the provided item before adding it to the trade inventory, ensuring that only
    valid items are processed. It integrates with TrinityCore's economy and trading
    subsystems to maintain consistency in item handling during transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully added to the trade inventory,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the item is invalid, already exists
    in the trade inventory, or if there are system constraints preventing the addition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (myItem != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    bool success = economyManager->AddItemToTrade(myItem);\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        // Item successfully added to trade\n    } else {\n        // Failed\
      \ to add item to trade\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EconomyManager instance is properly initialized
    and that the Item pointer passed is valid. The method may perform internal checks
    for item validity, such as verifying that the item has not been deleted or moved
    from its original location.
  warnings: Ensure that the Item pointer passed to this method is valid and not null.
    Passing a dangling pointer or an invalid item reference can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the TrinityCore system.
