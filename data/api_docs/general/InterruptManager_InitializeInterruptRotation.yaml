  class: InterruptManager
  method: InitializeInterruptRotation
  signature: void InterruptManager::InitializeInterruptRotation(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the interrupt rotation logic based on the number of group members.
  description: The InitializeInterruptRotation method sets up the interrupt rotation
    system within the InterruptManager class. This method configures how interrupts
    are handled and distributed among group members during combat scenarios. It typically
    initializes internal data structures or state variables that determine the order
    and frequency of interrupt attempts. The method is designed to be called once
    during initialization or when the group composition changes, ensuring that the
    interrupt rotation logic adapts to the current group size. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining balanced and fair interrupt mechanics in group-based
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: The number of members in the current group. This parameter determines
      how the interrupt rotation logic should be configured, affecting the distribution
      and timing of interrupt attempts among group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization with Group Size
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      int groupSize = 5;

      interruptMgr.InitializeInterruptRotation(groupSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Group Composition Update
    code: "void OnGroupUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        int memberCount = group->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \        interruptMgr.InitializeInterruptRotation(memberCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group composition is stable and
    known. It may reset internal counters or state variables related to interrupt
    rotation, so calling it frequently during active combat could cause unintended
    behavior. The implementation likely involves calculating rotation intervals or
    assigning roles based on group size.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or with invalid group member
    counts (e.g., negative values) may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect interrupt
    handling. Ensure that the groupMembers parameter represents a valid number of
    players in the group before invoking this method.
