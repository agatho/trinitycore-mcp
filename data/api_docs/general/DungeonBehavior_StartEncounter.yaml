  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: StartEncounter
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::StartEncounter(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a dungeon encounter for the specified group and encounter ID.
  description: The StartEncounter method is used to begin a specific dungeon encounter
    within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a Group object representing the players
    participating in the dungeon and a uint32 encounterId that identifies which encounter
    to start. This method typically triggers the encounter's initial phase, sets up
    necessary game state, and may handle player positioning or initial event triggers.
    The method is commonly used in dungeon scripts or AI behaviors to control when
    and how encounters begin for groups of players.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players participating
      in the dungeon encounter. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific dungeon encounter to start. This
      ID corresponds to predefined encounters within the dungeon's script configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Start
    code: 'Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();

      DungeonBehavior* behavior = sObjectAccessor->GetDungeonBehavior(player);

      behavior->StartEncounter(dungeonGroup, 12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within dungeon scripts or AI logic
    and should only be called when the group is properly formed and in a valid dungeon
    context. The encounterId must correspond to a valid encounter defined in the dungeon's
    script configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the encounterId corresponds to an actual
    encounter defined in the dungeon's script before calling this method.
