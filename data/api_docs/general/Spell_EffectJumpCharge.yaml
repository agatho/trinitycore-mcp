  brief: Executes a charge jump effect for spell targets
  description: The EffectJumpCharge method handles the execution of a charge jump
    behavior in spell mechanics, where a caster performs a physical movement towards
    a target position. This method typically occurs during spell casting when a specific
    jump effect is triggered, allowing the caster to move to a designated location
    within the game world. The implementation involves calculating the distance and
    direction between the caster and target, then applying movement mechanics to achieve
    the jump.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectJumpCharge();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires proper handling of target position calculations and
    may involve collision detection. Performance considerations include movement speed
    calculations and potential delay in execution if the jump involves complex pathfinding.
  warnings: Care must be taken when implementing this method as it could lead to unexpected
    behavior if target positions are not properly calculated or if movement restrictions
    are not respected.
