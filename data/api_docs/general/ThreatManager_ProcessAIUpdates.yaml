  brief: Processes AI updates for threat management in the creature's AI system
  description: The ProcessAIUpdates method handles the core logic for updating and
    managing threat levels within a creature's AI system. This method is typically
    called during the creature's AI update cycle to evaluate current target selection,
    adjust threat values based on combat actions, and ensure proper threat distribution
    among nearby players or units. It integrates with the overall AI framework to
    maintain accurate threat tracking and influence creature behavior such as target
    switching and spell casting decisions.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    me->GetThreatManager().ProcessAIUpdates();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called during the creature's AI update cycle
    and should not typically be invoked manually. It performs threat recalculations
    based on combat state, damage dealt, and other relevant factors. The method may
    trigger target switching if current target's threat drops below a threshold.
