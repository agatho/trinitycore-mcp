  method: IsActive
  signature: bool VoidformTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is currently in Voidform state.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the player character is currently
    in the Voidform magical state. This state typically occurs when a Shadow Priest
    uses the Voidform spell, which grants specific benefits such as increased damage
    and mana regeneration. The method returns true if the player has the Voidform
    buff active, and false otherwise. This check is commonly used in AI behavior scripts
    or spell logic to modify gameplay mechanics based on the player's current form.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in Voidform state; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "if (voidformTracker->IsActive())\n{\n    // Perform actions specific to\
      \ Voidform state\n    attacker->CastSpell(target, SPELL_VOIDFORM_DAMAGE_BOOST,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Voidform
    code: "if (!voidformTracker->IsActive())\n{\n    // Cast Voidform if not already\
      \ active\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_VOIDFORM, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with normal spell casting\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHADOW_WORD_PAIN,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal tracking of the Voidform buff state. It
    should be used in contexts where accurate state detection is required for gameplay
    mechanics or AI decision making.
