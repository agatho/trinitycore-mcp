documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is an auto action reset spell.
  description: This method checks if the current spell is classified as an auto action
    reset spell, which means it can be reset by auto actions such as attack or ability
    actions. The method returns true if the spell has auto action reset behavior,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for determining spell behavior
    in combat situations and affects how spells are handled during auto attacks and
    ability usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is an auto action reset spell, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell can be reset by auto actions like attack or ability
    actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsAutoActionResetSpell()) {\n    // Handle auto action reset\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell handling logic to
    determine if a spell should be reset during auto actions. Implementation may vary
    based on specific spell mechanics and game rules.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining spell cooldowns, as it
    only indicates auto action reset behavior, not actual cooldown status.
