  class: LootTemplate
  method: LinkConditions
  signature: bool LootTemplate::LinkConditions(const int & id, int reference)
documentation:
  brief: Links conditions to a loot template entry for conditional item drops in World
    of Warcraft.
  description: The LinkConditions method associates conditional requirements with
    a specific loot template entry, allowing items to be dropped only when certain
    criteria are met. This functionality is essential for implementing quest rewards,
    faction-specific loot, or other conditional drop mechanics in TrinityCore's loot
    system. The method typically checks if the provided ID corresponds to a valid
    loot template and links it to the specified reference conditions. It ensures that
    loot entries respect game rules and restrictions defined by the server configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the loot template entry to link conditions
      to. This ID typically corresponds to a specific item or group within the loot
      system.
  - name: reference
    description: The reference number that defines the conditional context for the
      loot template. This value determines which conditions are applied when evaluating
      whether an item should drop.
  returns: Returns true if the conditions were successfully linked to the specified
    loot template entry, false otherwise. The method may return false if the ID or
    reference values are invalid, or if linking fails due to system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LinkConditions
    code: 'LootTemplate* lootTemplate = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplate(12345);

      bool success = lootTemplate->LinkConditions(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional linking with error handling
    code: "LootTemplate* template = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplate(entryId);\nif (template\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    bool result = template->LinkConditions(entryId, conditionReference);\n\
      \    if (!result) {\n        // Handle failed linking\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to link conditions for loot template %u\", entryId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore loot manager
    during server initialization and database loading. Developers should not typically
    call this method directly unless implementing custom loot systems or modifying
    existing loot templates. The method assumes that the provided ID and reference
    values are valid and exist in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid IDs or references can lead to undefined
    behavior or corrupted loot data. Ensure all parameters are validated before calling
    this function, especially in custom modules or scripts. Improper usage may cause
    items to not drop correctly or cause server instability.
