  class: WaypointMovementFactory
  method: Create
  signature: MovementGenerator * WaypointMovementFactory::Create(Unit * object) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new waypoint movement generator for the specified unit.
  description: The Create method of WaypointMovementFactory is responsible for instantiating
    a MovementGenerator object that controls waypoint-based movement behavior for
    a given Unit. This factory pattern implementation ensures proper creation of movement
    generators tailored for NPC or creature waypoints. The returned MovementGenerator
    can be assigned to a unit's movement system to enable path-following behavior
    along predefined waypoints. The method typically integrates with TrinityCore's
    AI and movement subsystems to manage creature navigation through complex environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a newly created MovementGenerator object that handles waypoint-based
    movement for the specified unit, or nullptr if creation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WaypointMovementFactory factory;\nUnit* targetUnit = ...; // Some creature\
      \ with waypoints\nMovementGenerator* movementGen = factory.Create(targetUnit);\n\
      if (movementGen)\n{\n    targetUnit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveFollow(movementGen,\
      \ 0.0f, 0.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the factory pattern and should be used in conjunction
    with Unit's MotionMaster to properly assign movement behavior. The returned MovementGenerator
    must be managed carefully to avoid memory leaks. Implementation details may vary
    based on specific waypoint data structures and AI configurations within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the input Unit parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also,
    make sure the MovementGenerator returned by this factory is properly integrated
    with the unit's motion master to avoid inconsistent movement states.
