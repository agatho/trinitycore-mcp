  class: ProcFlagsInit
  method: operator=
  signature: ProcFlagsInit & ProcFlagsInit::operator=(const int & right)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns an integer value to a ProcFlagsInit object, setting its internal
    proc flags state.
  description: The operator= method in the ProcFlagsInit class allows assignment of
    a raw integer value to the proc flags initialization object. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework when configuring spell or ability
    proc behaviors. The assigned integer typically represents a bitmask of various
    proc flag conditions that determine under what circumstances a proc should trigger.
    The method returns a reference to the modified object, enabling chaining of assignments.
    This functionality is essential for defining complex proc mechanics such as damage-based
    procs, periodic effects, or conditional triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The integer value to assign to this ProcFlagsInit object. This should
      typically be a bitmask representing one or more proc flag conditions defined
      in the TrinityCore proc flag system.
  returns: A reference to the current ProcFlagsInit object after assignment, enabling
    method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'ProcFlagsInit procFlags;

      procFlags = PROC_FLAG_DONE_DAMAGE | PROC_FLAG_TAKEN_DAMAGE;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment
    code: "ProcFlagsInit procFlags;\nprocFlags = PROC_FLAG_DONE_SPELL_DAMAGE | PROC_FLAG_TAKEN_SPELL_DAMAGE;\n\
      // Can be used in expressions or further assignments\nif (procFlags == PROC_FLAG_DONE_SPELL_DAMAGE)\
      \ {\n    // Handle specific proc condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    loading spell definitions from database entries. The integer values assigned should
    correspond to predefined proc flag constants defined in the core codebase. The
    assignment operation does not validate that the flags are mutually exclusive or
    logically consistent, so developers must ensure proper combinations.
  warnings: Assigning invalid or undefined proc flag values may lead to unexpected
    behavior during spell execution. Be cautious when mixing different types of proc
    flags (e.g., physical vs. spell damage flags) as they may conflict with each other
    in certain game mechanics.
