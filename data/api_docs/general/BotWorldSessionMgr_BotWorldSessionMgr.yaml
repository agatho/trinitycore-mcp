    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotWorldSessionMgr instance as a copy of an existing instance.
  description: This method serves as a copy constructor for the BotWorldSessionMgr
    class, creating a new instance that is initialized with the state of an existing
    BotWorldSessionMgr object. It performs a deep copy of all relevant session management
    data and internal structures, ensuring that the newly created instance maintains
    the same session state and configuration as the source object. This functionality
    is essential for managing multiple bot world sessions within the TrinityCore framework,
    particularly when duplicating session configurations or transferring session states
    between different contexts. The method ensures proper initialization of all internal
    member variables and maintains thread safety during the copying process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying a BotWorldSessionMgr instance
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgr originalSession;

      // ... configure originalSession ...

      BotWorldSessionMgr copiedSession(originalSession);

      // copiedSession now contains a copy of all data from originalSession'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing bot sessions. It's important to note that this method performs a
    shallow copy of pointers and references, so any dynamically allocated memory should
    be handled carefully to avoid double-free errors or dangling pointers.
  warnings: When using this copy constructor, ensure that the source object is in
    a valid state before copying. If the source object contains invalid session data
    or corrupted internal structures, the copied instance will also contain those
    issues. Additionally, be aware that copying large session managers may have performance
    implications due to deep copying of session data.
