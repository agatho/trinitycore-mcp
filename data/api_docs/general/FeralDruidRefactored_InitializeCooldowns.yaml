  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking for all Feral Druid abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the internal cooldown tracking
    system for a Feral Druid character. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the Feral Druid specialization. It ensures
    that all relevant abilities such as Shred, Rake, Rip, and other feral combat skills
    have their cooldown timers properly initialized. The method prepares the AI to
    accurately manage ability usage according to game mechanics and player state.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the character's lifecycle,
    typically at login or specialization change. It does not reset existing cooldowns
    but rather initializes the tracking mechanism.
