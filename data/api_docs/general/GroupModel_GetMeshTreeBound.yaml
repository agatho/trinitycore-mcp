documentation:
  brief: Returns the bounding value of the mesh tree for the group model
  description: The GetMeshTreeBound method retrieves the boundary value associated
    with the mesh tree structure used by the GroupModel. This value typically represents
    a spatial boundary or limit within the group's mesh hierarchy, which is essential
    for collision detection, rendering culling, and spatial partitioning in the game
    world. The returned reference provides direct access to an internal integer member
    that defines this boundary, allowing efficient read access without copying the
    value. This method is commonly used during scene graph traversal or when performing
    spatial queries on grouped game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the mesh tree boundary
    value. This value usually indicates a maximum extent or limit within the group's
    mesh structure, such as a bounding box dimension or hierarchical level threshold.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Mesh Tree Bound for Collision Handling
    code: "GroupModel* model = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupModel();\nconst int& bound\
      \ = model->GetMeshTreeBound();\nif (bound > 0) {\n    // Use bound value for\
      \ collision calculations\n    std::cout << \"Mesh tree bound: \" << bound <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable, so modifications
    to the value through this reference will directly affect the GroupModel's state.
    This method is thread-safe if the underlying GroupModel object is not being modified
    concurrently by other threads.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing references to the returned value, as they may
    become invalid if the GroupModel object is destroyed or reinitialized. Ensure
    that the GroupModel instance remains valid for the duration of use.
