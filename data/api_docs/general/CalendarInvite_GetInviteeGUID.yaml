  signature: int CalendarInvite::GetInviteeGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the player invited to a calendar
    event
  description: The GetInviteeGUID method returns the globally unique identifier associated
    with the player who was invited to a calendar event. This GUID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to uniquely identify players across the game world and is essential
    for tracking invitations, managing event participation, and ensuring proper synchronization
    of calendar data. The method does not perform any validation or lookup operations;
    it simply returns the stored GUID value from the CalendarInvite object's internal
    state. This identifier can be used to retrieve player information, verify invitation
    status, or cross-reference with other systems that utilize GUIDs for player identification.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique global identifier (GUID) of the invited
    player. The value is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies the
    player within the TrinityCore database and game world context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Invitee GUID
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = GetCalendarInviteByEventId(eventId, inviteeId);

      int inviteeGUID = invite->GetInviteeGUID();

      printf("Invitee GUID: %d\n", inviteeGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is consistent with the standard TrinityCore player GUID
    format, which typically follows the pattern of a 32-bit integer. This method assumes
    that the CalendarInvite object has already been properly initialized with valid
    invitee data. The method is const and does not modify any internal state of the
    object.
  warnings: Ensure that the CalendarInvite object is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid object may return unexpected values.
    This method should only be called when the invitee GUID has been properly set
    during the calendar invitation creation process.
