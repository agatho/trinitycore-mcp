  class: QuestCompletion
  method: PreloadQuestData
  signature: void QuestCompletion::PreloadQuestData(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Preloads quest data for a player bot to optimize quest completion handling.
  description: The PreloadQuestData method initializes and loads all relevant quest
    information for a specified player bot. This includes fetching quest templates,
    objectives, rewards, and related data from the database or cache to ensure efficient
    processing during quest completion events. The method prepares internal structures
    that are used by other quest-related functions, reducing latency when the bot
    performs quest-related actions such as turning in quests or checking quest status.
    It is typically called during bot initialization or when a new quest becomes available
    to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which quest
      data will be preloaded. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PreloadQuestData
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.PreloadQuestData(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries and should not be called frequently
    during active gameplay to avoid performance degradation. It's recommended to call
    this method once during bot setup or when quest availability changes significantly.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents an actual
    bot instance; passing a null or invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
