  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateDpsBehavior(Player * dps, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates DPS behavior for a player during a dungeon encounter.
  description: The CoordinateDpsBehavior method manages and synchronizes the actions
    of a Dungeon Master's designated DPS player during an active dungeon encounter.
    This method ensures that the DPS player follows specific tactical guidelines,
    such as targeting priority, positioning, and cooldown usage, in alignment with
    the overall dungeon strategy. It integrates with the encounter's state machine
    to adapt behavior dynamically based on encounter phases or mechanics. The method
    is typically invoked by the Dungeon Master AI system when a new encounter begins
    or when significant changes occur during the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      behavior will be coordinated. Must not be null and must be a valid player within
      the dungeon instance.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter state, mechanics, and tactical requirements for the DPS behavior coordination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Start
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::OnEncounterStart(Player* player, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    CoordinateDpsBehavior(player, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Behavior Adjustment During Encounter
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::HandleEncounterPhaseChange(Player* dpsPlayer, const\
      \ DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n{\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_BOSS_ENRAGE)\n\
      \    {\n        CoordinateDpsBehavior(dpsPlayer, encounter);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is currently participating
    in a dungeon instance and has valid encounter-related data. The actual behavior
    coordination logic may vary depending on the specific encounter type and configured
    AI rules within the dungeon instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'dps' parameter points to a valid player who is part of
    the current dungeon group, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method
    should only be called during active dungeon encounters when the encounter state
    is properly initialized.
