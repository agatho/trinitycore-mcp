documentation:
  brief: Resets all performance metrics collected by the RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    system.
  description: The ResetPerformanceMetrics method clears and initializes all internal
    performance tracking data within the RoleBasedCombatPositioning class. This function
    is typically invoked to reset statistics before starting a new combat scenario
    or when transitioning between different role-based positioning configurations.
    It ensures that previous metric data does not interfere with subsequent measurements,
    providing clean baseline data for performance analysis. The method does not require
    any specific preconditions and can be safely called at any time during runtime.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioningSystem;

      positioningSystem.ResetPerformanceMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of all internal counters and timers
    used for performance tracking. It is recommended to call this function before
    beginning new combat simulations or when switching between different combat scenarios
    to ensure accurate metric collection.
