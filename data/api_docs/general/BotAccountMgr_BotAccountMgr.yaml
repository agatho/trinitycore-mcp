documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotAccountMgr instance as a copy of an existing instance.
  description: The BotAccountMgr constructor is responsible for creating a new instance
    of the BotAccountMgr class by copying the state from an existing BotAccountMgr
    object. This copy constructor ensures that all internal data members and configurations
    are duplicated from the source object to the newly created instance. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this method allows for the duplication of bot account
    management settings, configurations, or states when creating new bot account managers
    that should mirror an existing setup. The operation typically occurs during object
    instantiation where one BotAccountMgr needs to be initialized with the same properties
    as another.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a Copy of BotAccountMgr
    code: 'BotAccountMgr originalManager;

      // ... configure originalManager ...

      BotAccountMgr newManager(originalManager); // Uses copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. It performs a shallow
    copy of all member variables unless deep copying is required for complex objects.
    Developers should ensure that any pointers or dynamically allocated memory within
    the class are handled appropriately to prevent double-free errors or dangling
    references.
  warnings: If the BotAccountMgr class contains pointers or resources that require
    deep copying, this copy constructor may lead to unintended behavior such as multiple
    objects managing the same resource. Ensure all internal data structures support
    safe copying.
