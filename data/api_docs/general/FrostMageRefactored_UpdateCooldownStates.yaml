  class: FrostMageRefactored
  method: UpdateCooldownStates
  signature: void FrostMageRefactored::UpdateCooldownStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells of the frost mage
    character.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method manages and synchronizes the cooldown
    timers for all applicable spells and abilities within the FrostMageRefactored
    class. This method is typically invoked during game loop updates or when spell
    casting events occur to ensure accurate tracking of spell availability. It iterates
    through the mage's active cooldowns, reduces their remaining time, and updates
    the internal state to reflect which spells can be cast again. The method plays
    a crucial role in maintaining proper game balance by enforcing cooldown mechanics
    that prevent players from spamming powerful abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    FrostMageRefactored mage;\n    // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n    mage.UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... continue with spell\
      \ casting checks ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting System
    code: "void CastFrostNova()\n{\n    if (mage.CanCastSpell(FROST_NOVA))\n    {\n\
      \        // ... cast spell logic ...\n        mage.UpdateCooldownStates(); //\
      \ Update cooldowns after casting\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    cooldown tracking. It's important to note that this method does not directly handle
    spell casting - it only updates internal cooldown state. The actual spell execution
    and validation should occur separately in the spell system.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper game loop integration
    may cause performance issues. Ensure that cooldown updates are synchronized with
    the game's time system to maintain accurate timing across all players.
