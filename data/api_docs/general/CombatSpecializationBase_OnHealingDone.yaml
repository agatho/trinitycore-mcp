    amount)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when healing is done to a target unit
  description: The OnHealingDone method is invoked when a unit performs a healing
    action on another unit. This method serves as a callback in the combat specialization
    system, allowing custom behavior to be executed whenever healing occurs. It provides
    access to both the target being healed and the amount of healing performed, enabling
    developers to implement specialized mechanics such as healing-based resource generation,
    damage adjustments, or stat modifications. The method is typically used within
    custom combat specializations or scripts that extend standard healing behaviors
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that received the healing. This represents
      the target of the healing action and can be any valid unit in the game world.
  - name: amount
    description: The total amount of healing points that were applied to the target.
      This value is typically a positive integer representing the healing effect's
      magnitude.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Event Handler
    code: "void MyCombatSpec::OnHealingDone(Unit* target, uint32 amount)\n{\n    if\
      \ (amount > 1000)\n    {\n        // Trigger special effect for large heals\n\
      \        target->AddAura(12345, target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Healing-Based Resource Generation
    code: "void MyCombatSpec::OnHealingDone(Unit* target, uint32 amount)\n{\n    //\
      \ Generate mana based on healing done\n    if (Unit* caster = GetCaster())\n\
      \    {\n        caster->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA, amount / 10);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat specialization system and may be overridden
    in derived classes to customize healing behavior. It's important to note that
    this method does not modify the healing itself but rather responds to it after
    the fact. Ensure proper null checks on the target pointer if handling multiple
    unit types.
  warnings: Do not perform direct modifications to the healing amount within this
    method, as it is a notification-only callback. Avoid heavy computations or blocking
    operations in this function to prevent performance degradation during combat events.
