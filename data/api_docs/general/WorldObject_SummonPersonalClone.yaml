documentation:
  brief: Summon a personal clone of the WorldObject at the specified position with
    given despawn type and time.
  description: This method creates a temporary summoned creature or object that represents
    a personal clone of the calling WorldObject. The clone is summoned at the provided
    position with specific despawn behavior and time, and can optionally be associated
    with a vehicle ID, spell ID, and private object owner. This functionality is commonly
    used for creating temporary summons such as pet clones, companion summons, or
    other game mechanics involving personal cloning. The method allows for precise
    control over summoned object's behavior through various parameters including despawn
    type, time, and ownership.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position where the clone will be summoned. This determines the
      coordinates and orientation of the summoned object.
  - name: despawnType
    description: The type of despawn behavior for the summoned clone. This controls
      how and when the summon will be removed from the world, such as time-based,
      combat-based, or permanent.
  - name: despawnTime
    description: The time in milliseconds before the summon is automatically despawned.
      This parameter only applies to certain types of despawn behavior (e.g., time-based).
  - name: vehId
    description: Vehicle ID associated with the summoned clone, if applicable. This
      can be used to link the summon to a specific vehicle or mount.
  - name: spellId
    description: Spell ID associated with the summoned clone, if applicable. This
      can be used to associate the summon with a specific spell or effect.
  - name: privateObjectOwner
    description: The player who owns the private object being summoned. This parameter
      defines ownership and control over the summon.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TempSummon object that was created, which represents
    the summoned clone. The returned object may be null if the summon fails or is
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Summon Clone Example
    code: 'WorldObject* owner = ...;

      Position pos = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);

      TempSummonType type = TEMP_SUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN;

      int time = 60000;

      uint32 vehicleId = 0;

      uint32 spellId = 0;

      Player* ownerPlayer = nullptr;

      TempSummon* clone = owner->SummonPersonalClone(pos, type, time, vehicleId, spellId,
      ownerPlayer);'

  - title: Advanced Summon Clone with Vehicle and Spell
    code: 'WorldObject* owner = ...;

      Position pos = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);

      TempSummonType type = TEMP_SUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN;

      int time = 60000;

      uint32 vehicleId = 12345;

      uint32 spellId = 98765;

      Player* ownerPlayer = nullptr;

      TempSummon* clone = owner->SummonPersonalClone(pos, type, time, vehicleId, spellId,
      ownerPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method internally uses the TrinityCore summon
    system to create temporary summons. It is important to note that the returned
    TempSummon pointer may be null if the summon fails or if the WorldObject is not
    valid for summoning. Performance considerations include potential memory usage
    and thread safety when multiple clones are summoned simultaneously.'
  warnings: The method should be used carefully as it can lead to memory leaks if
    not properly managed. The returned pointer must be handled with care, as improper
    deletion can cause crashes or memory corruption. Also, the method may fail if
    the WorldObject is not valid for summoning or if parameters are invalid.
