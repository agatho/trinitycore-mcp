  brief: Regenerates player health points to restore health after damage or loss.
  description: The RegenerateHealth method restores the player's health points by
    replenishing them according to game mechanics. This method typically occurs when
    the player's health is below maximum value and needs to be restored through natural
    regeneration, such as during combat or when the player is not in combat. The method
    may also trigger regeneration of mana if the player is not in combat and has sufficient
    mana. It is commonly used in conjunction with other regeneration methods like
    RegenerateMana or when the player's health is below maximum value.

  notes: This method is typically called during combat or when the player is not in
    combat. It may also be used in conjunction with RegenerateMana to restore both
    health and mana points. The regeneration process is usually handled by the game
    engine and may involve different mechanisms depending on the player's state.
