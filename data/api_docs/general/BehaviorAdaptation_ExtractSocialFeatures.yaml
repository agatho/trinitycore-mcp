  brief: Extracts and processes social features from a player for behavior adaptation
    purposes
  description: The ExtractSocialFeatures method analyzes and retrieves relevant social
    data from a given player character to inform AI behavior decisions. This method
    is typically used in NPC AI systems to understand player social tendencies, relationships,
    and interaction patterns. It processes various social indicators such as faction
    standings, reputation levels, guild membership status, and recent social interactions.
    The extracted features are then utilized by the behavior adaptation system to
    customize NPC responses and actions based on the player's social profile. This
    method requires a valid Player object reference and returns an integer status
    code indicating success or failure of the extraction process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful feature extraction,
    negative values represent errors during processing, and positive values may indicate
    specific status conditions or warnings about the extracted social data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference\nint result = behaviorAdaptation->ExtractSocialFeatures(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Social features successfully extracted\n    // Proceed\
      \ with behavior adaptation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint result = behaviorAdaptation->ExtractSocialFeatures(bot);\n\
      switch (result) {\n    case 0:\n        // Success - proceed with AI adaptation\n\
      \        break;\n    case -1:\n        // Invalid player reference\n       \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Invalid player reference for social feature extraction\"\
      );\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Other error conditions\n      \
      \  sLog->outError(\"Social feature extraction failed with code: %d\", result);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the behavior adaptation system and should be called
    during appropriate AI decision-making cycles. The extracted social features are
    cached internally for performance reasons, so repeated calls with the same player
    may return cached results. The method assumes the player object is valid and properly
    initialized in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the player reference is valid
    before calling. The method may have performance implications when processing large
    numbers of players simultaneously, so consider batching operations where possible.
