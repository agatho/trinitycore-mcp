  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player bot migration manager, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for bot migration operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class for
    handling player bot migrations by initializing required internal components, loading
    configuration settings, and establishing necessary data structures. This method
    must be called before any migration operations can be performed. It typically
    handles setup tasks such as validating configuration files, allocating memory
    for migration queues, and ensuring all dependencies are available. The method
    returns true if initialization succeeds, or false if critical errors occur during
    setup that prevent proper operation of the migration manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player bot migration manager was successfully initialized
    with all required components and settings; returns false if initialization failed
    due to missing dependencies, invalid configuration, or other critical errors that
    would prevent the manager from functioning properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = new PlayerbotMigrationMgr();\nif\
      \ (migrationMgr->Initialize()) {\n    // Migration manager is ready for use\n\
      \    printf(\"Player bot migration manager initialized successfully.\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize\
      \ player bot migration manager.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle,
    typically during server startup or when the migration system is first needed.
    The initialization process may involve file I/O operations and configuration parsing
    which could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that any previous instance of PlayerbotMigrationMgr
    is properly destroyed before calling Initialize again.
