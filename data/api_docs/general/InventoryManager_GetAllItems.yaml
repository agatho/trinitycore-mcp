  class: InventoryManager
  method: GetAllItems
  signature: int InventoryManager::GetAllItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of all items in the inventory.
  description: The GetAllItems method returns the cumulative number of items currently
    stored within the player's inventory. This includes all item types such as equipment,
    consumables, quest items, and currency. The method iterates through all valid
    inventory slots and counts each item present, regardless of stack size or item
    type. It does not distinguish between different categories of items but provides
    a single aggregate count. This functionality is commonly used for inventory management,
    UI display updates, and game logic that requires knowledge of total item quantity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of items in the inventory.
    Returns zero if no items are present or if the inventory is inaccessible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int itemCount = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetInventory()->GetAllItems();\n\
      if (itemCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player has \" << itemCount << \" items\
      \ in inventory.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Management Check
    code: "uint32 totalItems = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetInventory()->GetAllItems();\n\
      if (totalItems >= MAX_INVENTORY_ITEMS)\n{\n    // Handle inventory full condition\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Your inventory is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently due
    to the need to iterate through all inventory slots. It's recommended to cache
    this value if it's accessed multiple times per game tick or frame update. The
    implementation assumes that the inventory manager is properly initialized and
    accessible.
  warnings: This method does not account for temporary item restrictions or conditions
    that might prevent items from being counted (e.g., locked items). Additionally,
    calling this method on a player who is not logged in may result in undefined behavior
    or return incorrect values.
