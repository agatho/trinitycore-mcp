  method: SaveToDB
  signature: void Pet::SaveToDB(uint32 param0, const int & param1)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the pet's data to the database with specified parameters.
  description: 'The SaveToDB method persists the current state of a Pet object to
    the TrinityCore database. This method is typically invoked when changes to the
    pet''s properties need to be committed to storage, such as when the pet''s level,
    experience, or ownership is modified. The method accepts two parameters: a uint32
    identifier and a reference to an integer, which likely represent different aspects
    of the pet''s data context. It ensures that all relevant pet information is synchronized
    with the database for persistence across server sessions.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer used as an identifier or context value,
      potentially representing the pet's entry ID, instance ID, or a specific data
      category within the database.
  - name: param1
    description: A constant reference to an integer that likely represents a state
      flag, version number, or another metadata field used during the save operation
      to ensure consistency and proper handling of the pet's data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Save Example
    code: 'Pet* myPet = ...; // Assume a valid pet object

      myPet->SaveToDB(12345, 1);

      // Saves the pet with ID 12345 and version flag 1 to the database.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pet Save During Level Up
    code: "if (playerPet->GetLevel() > previousLevel)\n{\n    playerPet->SaveToDB(playerPet->GetEntry(),\
      \ playerPet->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_PET_LEVEL));\n}\n// Saves pet data when\
      \ it levels up, using its entry and current level as parameters."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when changes to the pet's state are ready
    for persistence. It is recommended to batch multiple updates before calling SaveToDB
    to avoid excessive database writes. The method may perform internal checks to
    determine if saving is necessary, but it does not return a success or failure
    status.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the Pet object may
    lead to data corruption or incomplete saves. Ensure that all relevant pet fields
    are properly set before invoking SaveToDB. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency
    loops as it can impact performance due to database I/O operations.
