  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: RecordItemPurchase
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::RecordItemPurchase(uint32 itemId, uint32
    cost)
documentation:
  brief: Records an item purchase made by a player from an NPC, storing the item ID
    and its cost for tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordItemPurchase method is used to log a transaction where a
    player purchases an item from an NPC within the World of Warcraft environment.
    This function stores the unique identifier of the purchased item along with its
    cost in the interaction manager's internal records. The method is typically invoked
    during NPC vendor interactions when a player buys an item, allowing the system
    to maintain data about player spending habits and NPC transaction history. It
    does not perform any validation on the input parameters but assumes that the itemId
    and cost are valid for the current game context.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being purchased. This value corresponds
      to the item's entry in the database and must be a valid item ID within the game
      world.
  - name: cost
    description: The cost in copper coins that the player paid for the item. This
      represents the full transaction amount and should reflect the actual price set
      by the NPC vendor.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Purchase Recording
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->RecordItemPurchase(12345, 5000); // Player buys item ID 12345
      for 50 silver'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Purchases
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->RecordItemPurchase(12345, 5000);

      interactionMgr->RecordItemPurchase(67890, 15000);

      interactionMgr->RecordItemPurchase(54321, 2500);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the NPC interaction tracking system and may be used
    for various purposes such as generating purchase reports, implementing quest requirements
    based on purchases, or enforcing vendor-specific restrictions. The method does
    not perform any database writes directly; it only stores the data in memory for
    later processing or persistence.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId and cost values are valid before calling this function
    to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should only be called during active
    NPC interactions to maintain accurate transaction logs.
