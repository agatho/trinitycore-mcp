api:
  class: ArenaTeam
  method: Disband
  signature: void ArenaTeam::Disband()
documentation:
  brief: Disbands the arena team, removing all members and destroying the team structure.
  description: The Disband method completely dissolves an arena team by removing all
    its members from the team roster, clearing internal data structures, and marking
    the team as inactive. This operation is typically invoked when an arena team is
    no longer needed or when a player wishes to terminate their team participation.
    The method ensures that all team-related data is properly cleaned up and that
    affected players are notified of the team's dissolution. It also handles cleanup
    of any associated arena match data and updates the game state accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disband an Arena Team
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->Disband();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the arena team is no longer active
    or when a player explicitly requests to leave the team. It performs cleanup operations
    that may affect other systems, such as match tracking and player statistics. The
    disbanding process is immediate and does not support rollback.
  warnings: Calling Disband on an already disbanded team may result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that all references to the arena team are properly managed after calling
    this method to prevent memory access violations or dangling pointers.
