  signature: int PositionManager::FindHealerPosition(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal healer position within a group based on member count
    and positioning constraints.
  description: The FindHealerPosition method calculates and returns the most suitable
    location for a healer character within a group, taking into account the number
    of group members and their spatial arrangement. This method is typically used
    in group-based scenarios such as dungeons or raids where optimal positioning is
    crucial for effective healing. The returned value represents an index or identifier
    that corresponds to a predefined healer position in the group formation logic.
    The method assumes that group members are already properly initialized and positioned
    within the game world, and it does not modify any existing positions but rather
    evaluates them to determine the best placement for the healer.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the index or identifier of the optimal healer
    position within the group. A return value of -1 typically indicates an error condition
    such as insufficient group members or invalid positioning data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine healer position
    code: "int healerPos = positionManager.FindHealerPosition(5);\nif (healerPos !=\
      \ -1) {\n    // Use the healerPos to set or move the healer to that position\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Healer should be positioned at index: \" << healerPos <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed\
      \ to determine healer position\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group positioning system and may interact
    with other methods that manage group member positions. It's important to note
    that the actual positioning logic might depend on factors such as map boundaries,
    obstacle detection, or specific raid configurations. The method should be called
    after ensuring that group members are properly initialized and their positions
    are known.
  warnings: The method may return -1 in error conditions, which should always be checked
    by calling code to prevent unexpected behavior. Additionally, this method might
    not be thread-safe if used concurrently with other position management operations,
    so proper synchronization should be considered in multi-threaded environments.
