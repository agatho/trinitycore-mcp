documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is affected by any spell mods.
  description: This method checks if the current spell is influenced by any spell
    modifiers that might alter its behavior or effects. It is commonly used in spell
    processing to determine if a spell should be modified based on various spell mod
    conditions, such as those applied by talents, glyphs, or other game mechanics.
    The method returns true if the spell is affected by at least one spell modifier,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is affected by any spell modifiers, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAffectedBySpellMods()) {\n    // Spell is affected by\
      \ mods\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically involves checking against a list of spell modifiers
    that may be applied to the spell, and it's often used in conjunction with other
    spell-related methods like GetSpellModList() or similar. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary calls when dealing with large numbers of spells.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a standalone check without considering
    the broader context of spell modifiers; it may return false even if a spell has
    modifiers applied to it in certain scenarios.
