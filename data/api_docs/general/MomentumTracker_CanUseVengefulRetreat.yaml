documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can use the Vengeful Retreat ability based
    on momentum state and cooldown conditions.
  description: The CanUseVengefulRetreat method evaluates if a player is currently
    eligible to cast the Vengeful Retreat ability. This check typically considers
    factors such as the player's current momentum state, whether the ability is on
    cooldown, and any other relevant game mechanics that might prevent usage. The
    method returns true if all conditions are met for using the ability, and false
    otherwise. In the context of TrinityCore and World of Warcraft gameplay, this
    method would be used within AI or player action logic to determine valid spell
    casting opportunities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can use Vengeful Retreat, false if they cannot.
    This indicates whether all preconditions for casting the ability are satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (momentumTracker->CanUseVengefulRetreat()) {\n    // Player can use\
      \ Vengeful Retreat\n    player->CastSpell(target, VENGEFUL_RETREAT_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with cooldown management
    code: "if (momentumTracker->CanUseVengefulRetreat() && !player->HasSpellCooldown(VENGEFUL_RETREAT_SPELL_ID))\
      \ {\n    // Both momentum and cooldown conditions met\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ VENGEFUL_RETREAT_SPELL_ID, true);\n} else {\n    // Cannot use ability at\
      \ this time\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Cannot use Vengeful Retreat right\
      \ now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal momentum tracking systems and
    cooldown timers. It may be called frequently during AI decision-making processes,
    so performance is important. The exact implementation details depend on how momentum
    and cooldown states are tracked within the MomentumTracker class.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not used in scenarios where it might bypass
    other game rules or restrictions. Always verify that the player has sufficient
    resources (mana, energy, etc.) before attempting to cast the spell after this
    check passes.
