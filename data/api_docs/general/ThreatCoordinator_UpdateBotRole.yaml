  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: UpdateBotRole
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::UpdateBotRole(int botGuid, ThreatRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat role assigned to a specific bot within the threat coordination
    system.
  description: The UpdateBotRole method modifies the designated threat role for a
    given bot identified by its GUID. This function is used in the context of AI-driven
    threat management, where bots are assigned specific roles such as tank, healer,
    or damage dealer to maintain optimal combat dynamics. The method updates internal
    tracking structures within the ThreatCoordinator to reflect the new role assignment.
    It does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but ensures that the threat system
    accurately reflects the current role configuration for proper AI behavior and
    coordination.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose threat role is to be
      updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot in the system.
  - name: role
    description: The new ThreatRole enum value that defines how the bot should behave
      in terms of threat generation and management. Valid values are typically defined
      within the ThreatRole enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a bot's role to Tank
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateBotRole(12345, ThreatRole::TANK);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assign a bot to the Healer role
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coord = GetThreatCoordinator();

      coord->UpdateBotRole(playerGuid, ThreatRole::HEALER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or when a bot's role
    changes dynamically. It assumes that the provided bot GUID exists and that the
    ThreatRole enum value is valid. The implementation may involve locking mechanisms
    to ensure thread safety in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Passing an invalid bot GUID may lead to undefined behavior or system errors.
    Ensure that all bot GUIDs are validated before calling this method. Also, excessive
    calls to this function might impact performance if not batched properly.
