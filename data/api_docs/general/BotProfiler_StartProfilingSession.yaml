  class: BotProfiler
  method: StartProfilingSession
  signature: uint64_t BotProfiler::StartProfilingSession(const std::string & sessionName,
    ProfilingSessionType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a new bot profiling session with the specified name and type, returning
    a unique session identifier.
  description: The StartProfilingSession method creates and begins a new profiling
    session for bot behavior analysis within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a
    session name and type as parameters to categorize the profiling data. The method
    returns a unique 64-bit identifier (GUID) that can be used to reference this specific
    profiling session throughout its lifetime. This functionality is typically used
    by developers or administrators to monitor, debug, or optimize bot performance
    in World of Warcraft environments. The session will remain active until explicitly
    stopped via a corresponding stop method, and multiple sessions can run concurrently
    with distinct identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionName
    description: A string identifier for the profiling session. Should be descriptive
      and unique to avoid conflicts with other active sessions.
  - name: type
    description: The type of profiling session to initiate, determining how the collected
      data will be categorized or processed. Valid values are typically defined by
      an enumeration in the ProfilingSessionType class.
  returns: Returns a uint64_t value representing the unique identifier (GUID) assigned
    to the newly started profiling session. This ID can be used for subsequent operations
    such as stopping, querying status, or retrieving collected data from the session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint64_t sessionId = botProfiler.StartProfilingSession("CombatAnalysis",
      ProfilingSessionType::COMBAT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Concurrent Sessions
    code: 'uint64_t session1 = botProfiler.StartProfilingSession("MovementTracking",
      ProfilingSessionType::MOVEMENT);

      uint64_t session2 = botProfiler.StartProfilingSession("AIProcessing", ProfilingSessionType::AI);

      // Both sessions can run simultaneously and be managed independently'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotProfiler subsystem, which is designed for internal
    use in TrinityCore's bot management system. The returned session ID should be
    stored securely as it is required to manage the session lifecycle. Sessions consume
    system resources while active and should be properly terminated when no longer
    needed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotProfiler subsystem
    may result in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that all necessary components
    are loaded before attempting to start a profiling session.
