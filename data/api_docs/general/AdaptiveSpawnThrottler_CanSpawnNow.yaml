  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: CanSpawnNow
  signature: bool AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::CanSpawnNow() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spawn event can occur based on adaptive throttling logic.
  description: The CanSpawnNow method evaluates the current state of the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
    to decide if it is permissible to initiate a new spawn event. This mechanism helps
    regulate spawn rates dynamically, preventing excessive spawning that could impact
    server performance or game balance. The decision is typically based on factors
    such as time elapsed since last spawn, current spawn limits, and system load conditions.
    This method does not modify any internal state but provides a read-only check
    for spawn eligibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the conditions are met to allow a spawn event to occur;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that spawning should
    be delayed or skipped according to throttling rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "if (adaptiveThrottler.CanSpawnNow()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning logic\n\
      \    SpawnCreature();\n} else {\n    // Delay or skip spawn\n    ScheduleNextSpawnAttempt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Behavior
    code: "class CreatureAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (adaptiveThrottler.CanSpawnNow()) {\n       \
      \     // Spawn additional creatures\n            DoSpawn();\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other throttling mechanisms
    to ensure that spawn events are distributed evenly over time. It's important to
    note that the decision made by this method may change between calls due to dynamic
    adjustments in the throttler's internal state, such as changes in system load
    or configurable limits.
