documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a spell interruption action
    within the bot's AI decision-making process.
  description: The GetPriority method determines the relative importance or urgency
    of interrupting a spell cast by an enemy target. This value is used by the BotAI
    system to prioritize actions when multiple potential interrupt opportunities exist.
    The priority calculation typically considers factors such as the spell's damage
    type, duration, threat level, and the bot's current combat state. Higher priority
    values indicate more urgent or beneficial interrupts to perform. This method is
    part of the SpellInterruptAction class which encapsulates the logic for evaluating
    and executing spell interruption decisions in the TrinityCore AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated priority of this spell interrupt
    action. Higher values indicate higher priority, with 0 typically meaning no priority
    or invalid state. The exact scale and interpretation may vary based on implementation
    details within the BotAI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 priority = interruptAction.GetPriority(ai);\nif (priority > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with interrupt action\n    ai->ExecuteInterruptAction(interruptAction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Interrupt Priorities
    code: "SpellInterruptAction* action1 = new SpellInterruptAction(...);\nSpellInterruptAction*\
      \ action2 = new SpellInterruptAction(...);\nuint32 priority1 = action1->GetPriority(ai);\n\
      uint32 priority2 = action2->GetPriority(ai);\n\nif (priority1 > priority2)\n\
      {\n    // Execute higher priority interrupt\n    ai->ExecuteInterruptAction(action1);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    ai->ExecuteInterruptAction(action2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle when
    evaluating potential spell interruption opportunities. The priority calculation
    may involve complex heuristics based on target spell information, bot class abilities,
    and current combat situation. Implementation details may vary between different
    BotAI modules or custom modifications to the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: The returned priority value should not be used directly for action execution
    without proper validation. Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
