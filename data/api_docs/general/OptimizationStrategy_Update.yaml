documentation:
  brief: Updates the optimization strategy with a new fitness value to refine the
    AI's decision-making process.
  description: The Update method in the OptimizationStrategy class is responsible
    for incorporating a new fitness value into the optimization algorithm. This method
    typically serves as part of an evolutionary or adaptive AI system where fitness
    values represent the effectiveness of certain strategies or decisions. The method
    likely modifies internal state variables such as weights, probabilities, or strategy
    parameters based on the provided fitness score. It may be invoked during AI training
    cycles or when evaluating the performance of different approaches in dynamic game
    scenarios. This method does not return any value but directly affects the object's
    internal state for future optimization iterations.

  notes: This method is likely part of a larger evolutionary algorithm framework within
    TrinityCore's AI system. It may be called repeatedly during training sessions
    to iteratively improve AI behavior. The implementation might involve statistical
    calculations or machine learning techniques to adjust strategy parameters based
    on fitness feedback.
