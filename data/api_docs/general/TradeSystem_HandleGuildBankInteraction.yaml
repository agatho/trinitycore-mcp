documentation:
  brief: Handles interaction with a guild bank for a player, managing access and transactions.
  description: The HandleGuildBankInteraction method processes player requests related
    to guild bank operations. It validates player permissions, checks guild membership
    status, and manages item deposits, withdrawals, and transfers within the guild's
    shared banking system. This method ensures that only authorized guild members
    can interact with the guild bank and enforces game rules such as item limits,
    cooldowns, and transaction restrictions. The method typically gets invoked when
    a player interacts with a guild bank NPC or interface element.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object requesting guild bank interaction. Must
      be a valid player instance with active guild membership.
  - name: guildBankGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the guild bank object being accessed.
      Used to locate and validate the specific guild bank instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Bank Interaction
    code: "void HandleGuildBankInteraction(Player* player, uint32 guildBankGuid)\n\
      {\n    if (!player || !player->GetGuild())\n        return;\n    \n    // Validate\
      \ guild bank exists and is accessible\n    if (guildBankGuid == 0)\n       \
      \ return;\n    \n    // Process the interaction logic here\n    // ... implementation\
      \ details ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player permissions and guild membership have already
    been validated before calling. The actual item handling and transaction logic
    is likely delegated to other subsystems within TrinityCore's trade or guild management
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and that the guild bank GUID corresponds
    to an existing, accessible guild bank object. Improper validation could lead to
    crashes or unauthorized access.
