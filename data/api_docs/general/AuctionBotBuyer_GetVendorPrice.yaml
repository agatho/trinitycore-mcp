  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: GetVendorPrice
  signature: uint32 AuctionBotBuyer::GetVendorPrice(uint32 quality)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the vendor price for a specific item quality used by the Auction
    Bot buyer system.
  description: The GetVendorPrice method returns the base vendor price value associated
    with a given item quality level. This function is typically utilized within the
    AuctionBotBuyer class to determine appropriate purchase prices for items based
    on their quality. The method likely maps quality levels (such as poor, common,
    uncommon, etc.) to corresponding vendor price values that reflect in-game pricing
    mechanics. It serves as a core component in calculating bid prices and managing
    the bot's purchasing behavior within the auction house system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the vendor price for the specified
    item quality. The value corresponds to the base gold amount that would be charged
    by a vendor for an item of that quality level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 price = buyer.GetVendorPrice(ITEM_QUALITY_COMMON);

      // Returns the vendor price for common quality items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal lookup tables or configuration data
    that maps item qualities to their respective vendor prices. The implementation
    may cache results for performance optimization. Developers should ensure that
    quality values passed to this method are valid enumerations within the game's
    item quality system.
