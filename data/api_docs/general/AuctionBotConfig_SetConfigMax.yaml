  class: AuctionBotConfig
  method: SetConfigMax
  signature: void AuctionBotConfig::SetConfigMax(AuctionBotConfigUInt32Values index,
    const char * fieldname, uint32 defvalue, uint32 maxvalue)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a maximum value for a specified auction bot configuration parameter.
  description: The SetConfigMax method configures the maximum allowed value for a
    specific auction bot configuration setting identified by the provided index. This
    method is typically used during initialization or configuration loading to enforce
    upper bounds on configurable parameters such as auction durations, item counts,
    or pricing limits. The method takes a field name, default value, and maximum value
    to establish these constraints within the AuctionBotConfig system. It ensures
    that any subsequent attempts to set values for this configuration parameter will
    not exceed the defined maximum threshold.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: An enumeration value identifying which auction bot configuration
      parameter is being configured. This index corresponds to a specific configuration
      field within the AuctionBotConfig system.
  - name: fieldname
    description: A null-terminated string representing the human-readable name of
      the configuration field. Used for logging and debugging purposes to identify
      which parameter is being set.
  - name: defvalue
    description: The default value that will be used if no explicit value is provided
      for this configuration parameter. This serves as a fallback when the configuration
      system cannot determine an appropriate value.
  - name: maxvalue
    description: The maximum allowable value for the specified auction bot configuration
      parameter. Any attempt to set a value higher than this will be capped or rejected
      depending on implementation details.
  returns: This method does not return a value (void).
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Auction Duration
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetConfigMax(AuctionBotConfigUInt32Values::AUCTION_DURATION_MAX,
      "auction_duration", 30, 1440);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Maximum Item Count Per Auction
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetConfigMax(AuctionBotConfigUInt32Values::ITEM_COUNT_MAX,
      "item_count", 100, 1000);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or configuration reload
    operations. The implementation likely stores these maximum values in an internal
    configuration map or array indexed by the provided enum value. It's important
    to note that this method sets constraints but does not validate existing values
    - only future assignments are checked against the maximum.
  warnings: Calling this method after the configuration system has been initialized
    may have unpredictable effects on running auctions or active configurations. Ensure
    all calls occur during safe initialization phases before any auction activity
    begins.
