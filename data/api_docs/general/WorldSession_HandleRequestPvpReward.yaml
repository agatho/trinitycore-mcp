documentation:
  brief: Processes a request from a player to claim PvP rewards after completing a
    battleground.
  description: The HandleRequestPvpReward method is responsible for handling client
    requests to claim rewards earned through participation in battlegrounds. When
    a player finishes a match and requests their rewards, this method validates the
    player's eligibility, checks if they have completed the required objectives, and
    then sends appropriate reward items or currency to the player. It integrates with
    the PvP system to ensure that players receive their rightful rewards based on
    their performance and faction standing. This method typically executes after a
    battleground has ended and the player is in the reward window.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestPvpReward(WorldPackets::Battleground::RequestPVPRewards&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate player is in a valid battleground state\n    if\
      \ (!GetPlayer()->InBattleground())\n        return;\n    \n    // Process reward\
      \ claim logic here\n    GetPlayer()->RewardPvpKill();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the client upon completion
    of a battleground match. It assumes that the player's battleground state has already
    been validated and updated. The actual reward distribution logic may involve multiple
    internal checks including honor points, arena points, and faction-specific rewards.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to reward duplication or denial
    of legitimate rewards. Ensure all battleground state transitions are properly
    synchronized before calling this method.
