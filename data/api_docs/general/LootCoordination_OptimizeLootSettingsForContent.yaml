  class: LootCoordination
  method: OptimizeLootSettingsForContent
  signature: void LootCoordination::OptimizeLootSettingsForContent(Group * group,
    uint32 contentType)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts loot distribution settings based on the content type and group composition
    for optimal gameplay.
  description: The OptimizeLootSettingsForContent method modifies the loot coordination
    behavior within a group to align with the specific content type being encountered.
    This includes adjusting loot rules, distribution priorities, and item assignment
    strategies depending on whether the group is engaging in dungeons, raids, world
    bosses, or other content types. The method evaluates the group's composition and
    the nature of the content to ensure that loot distribution remains fair and appropriate
    for the encounter. It typically modifies internal loot settings such as loot thresholds,
    greed roll configurations, and item assignment logic without directly modifying
    the loot itself.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the loot coordination. Must not be null.
  - name: contentType
    description: Identifier indicating the type of content being engaged with (e.g.,
      DUNGEON, RAID, WORLD_BOSS). Valid values are defined by TrinityCore's content
      type enums such as CONTENT_TYPE_DUNGEON, CONTENT_TYPE_RAID, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Optimize loot settings for a raid group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n    LootCoordination::OptimizeLootSettingsForContent(raidGroup,\
      \ CONTENT_TYPE_RAID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjust loot settings for a dungeon encounter
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (dungeonGroup)\n{\n    LootCoordination::OptimizeLootSettingsForContent(dungeonGroup,\
      \ CONTENT_TYPE_DUNGEON);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group creation or upon entering a
    new content area. It modifies internal loot coordination state rather than directly
    affecting player loot. The method assumes that the provided Group object is valid
    and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer passed to this method is not null, as passing
    a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    should only be called when content type changes are confirmed and before loot
    distribution begins.
