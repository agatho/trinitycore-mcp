  method: GetTableHash
  signature: uint32 DB2StorageBase::GetTableHash() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the hash value of the DB2 table structure for identification
    purposes.
  description: The GetTableHash method computes a unique 32-bit hash value based on
    the internal structure and metadata of a DB2 storage table. This hash is typically
    used to verify table integrity, ensure compatibility between different versions
    of game data, or identify specific table types within the TrinityCore database
    system. The method performs a deterministic calculation that takes into account
    field definitions, data types, and other structural elements of the loaded DB2
    file. It is commonly employed during runtime validation checks and can be useful
    for debugging or implementing version-specific behavior in custom modules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the computed hash of the DB2 table
    structure. This value uniquely identifies the table's layout and can be used for
    comparison, validation, or lookup purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Table Hash for Validation
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* storage = sDB2Manager->GetStorage("Creature");

      uint32 hash = storage->GetTableHash();

      TC_LOG_INFO("sql.sql", "Creature table hash: %u", hash);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned hash value is computed at runtime based on the loaded DB2 file's
    metadata and structure. It may change if the DB2 schema is modified or reloaded,
    making it unsuitable for persistent identification across different sessions unless
    the table remains unchanged.
