  method: GetMinionGUID
  signature: int Unit::GetMinionGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the unit's minion, if any.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the minion associated
    with the unit. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to identify summoned creatures or pets. The method returns an integer value representing
    the GUID of the minion, which can be used for various game mechanics such as tracking,
    interaction, or manipulation of the minion within the game world. This function
    typically applies to units that have a minion, such as players or NPCs with summoning
    capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer GUID identifier of the unit's minion.
    If no minion exists, the method returns 0 or a negative value indicating no valid
    GUID is available. The specific value depends on how the minion was created and
    stored within the unit's data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetMinion();\nint minionGUID = unit->GetMinionGUID();\n\
      if (minionGUID > 0)\n{\n    // Process the GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods like GetMinion
    or GetSummonedCreature, and may require checking if a minion exists before calling
    this function. Performance considerations are minimal as it simply retrieves stored
    data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method on units that do not have minions;
    calling this method on such units may result in undefined behavior or invalid
    GUIDs.
