  brief: Initializes a performance logger for tracking player bot operation execution
    times
  description: The PlayerbotPerformanceLogger constructor initializes a performance
    logging mechanism to monitor and measure the execution time of various player
    bot operations. This functionality is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks
    in AI-driven bot behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The logger typically
    records timestamps before and after operation execution, enabling detailed profiling
    of bot decision-making processes and action execution times. It supports tracking
    multiple concurrent operations and provides metrics that help optimize bot performance
    and responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier representing the specific player bot operation
      being tracked. This name is used to categorize and differentiate between various
      bot activities such as 'Movement', 'Combat', 'Quest', or 'Chat'. The operation
      name should be descriptive and consistent for accurate performance analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Logging Initialization
    code: 'PlayerbotPerformanceLogger logger("Combat");

      // This initializes a performance logger specifically for tracking combat-related
      bot operations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Concurrent Operation Logging
    code: 'PlayerbotPerformanceLogger moveLogger("Movement");

      PlayerbotPerformanceLogger combatLogger("Combat");

      PlayerbotPerformanceLogger questLogger("Quest");

      // Multiple loggers can be created simultaneously to track different bot operations
      concurrently'
    language: cpp
  notes: The performance logger internally uses high-resolution timers to ensure accurate
    measurement of operation durations. It's designed to minimize overhead during
    normal operation, but multiple concurrent loggers may impact performance in heavily
    loaded environments. The implementation typically stores timing data in memory
    and can be configured to output results to logs or external monitoring systems.
  warnings: Creating too many concurrent performance loggers without proper cleanup
    may lead to memory leaks. Ensure that each logger instance is properly managed
    and destroyed when no longer needed. The operation names should be carefully chosen
    to avoid conflicts and ensure meaningful performance analysis.
