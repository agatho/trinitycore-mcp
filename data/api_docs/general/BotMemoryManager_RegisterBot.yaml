  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::RegisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot with the memory manager using its unique identifier.
  description: The RegisterBot method adds a bot to the internal tracking system of
    the BotMemoryManager. This allows the memory manager to associate and manage memory-related
    data for the specified bot. The method typically initializes or updates internal
    data structures that store bot-specific information such as memory state, behavior
    patterns, or contextual data. It is commonly called when a new bot is created
    or loaded into the game world, ensuring that the bot's memory context is properly
    initialized and maintained throughout its lifecycle. This registration process
    is essential for proper memory management and ensures that bot-specific operations
    can be efficiently tracked and executed.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to register. This value must
      be a valid, non-zero GUID that uniquely identifies the bot within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      memoryManager.RegisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Bots
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nBotMemoryManager\
      \ memoryManager;\nfor (uint32_t guid : botGuids) {\n    memoryManager.RegisterBot(guid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot creation or loading. The internal
    implementation may involve thread-safe operations, especially in multi-threaded
    server environments. It's important to ensure that the GUID passed is valid and
    has not already been registered to avoid potential conflicts or memory leaks.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or zero GUID to this method may result in undefined
    behavior or memory corruption. Always validate bot GUIDs before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with dynamically created bots.
