  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: FlushBotCache
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::FlushBotCache(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the cached data associated with a specific bot GUID from memory.
  description: The FlushBotCache method removes all cached information related to
    a specified bot instance identified by its unique Game Object Identifier (GUID).
    This operation ensures that subsequent accesses to the bot's data will fetch fresh
    information from the source, bypassing any stale or outdated cache entries. The
    method is typically invoked when a bot's state has changed significantly and cached
    data may no longer be valid. It helps maintain consistency in bot behavior and
    prevents issues caused by using obsolete cached values.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose cache should be flushed.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Flushing Cache for a Specific Bot
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::GetInstance();

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      memoryManager->FlushBotCache(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    performs an immediate cache invalidation without delay, making it suitable for
    real-time updates during gameplay. The underlying implementation likely uses a
    hash map or similar data structure to store and retrieve cached entries by GUID.
