api:
  class: MotionMaster
  method: GetMovementGeneratorsInformation
  signature: int MotionMaster::GetMovementGeneratorsInformation() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of active movement generators for a creature or player.
  description: This method retrieves the count of active movement generators currently
    assigned to an object's motion master. Movement generators are responsible for
    controlling how an NPC or player moves through the world, including patrol, follow,
    evading, and other movement behaviors. The returned value represents the total
    number of active movement generators in the motion master's list, which can be
    useful for debugging, performance monitoring, or understanding the current movement
    state of an object. This method is typically used in conjunction with other motion-related
    APIs to manage and analyze movement behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of active movement generators
    currently assigned to the motion master. A value of 0 indicates no active movement
    generators, while higher values indicate multiple active generators are managing
    the object's movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int count = creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetMovementGeneratorsInformation();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not include any active movement generators that may be in
    the process of being removed or are pending removal. It only returns the count
    of currently active generators.
  warnings: This method should not be used for performance-critical code sections,
    as it involves iterating through all active movement generators and can be computationally
    expensive if many generators are present.
