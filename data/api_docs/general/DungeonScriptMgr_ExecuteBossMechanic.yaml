  class: DungeonScriptMgr
  method: ExecuteBossMechanic
  signature: void DungeonScriptMgr::ExecuteBossMechanic(int * player, int * boss,
    MechanicType mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a boss mechanic for a given player and boss based on the specified
    mechanic type.
  description: The ExecuteBossMechanic method is responsible for triggering specific
    boss mechanics within dungeon encounters. It takes references to player and boss
    identifiers along with a mechanic type to determine how the mechanic should be
    applied. This method is typically used during encounter scripting to manage complex
    boss abilities, debuffs, or interactions that occur during combat. The method
    likely integrates with TrinityCore's event system and may involve checking conditions,
    applying effects, or notifying other systems about the mechanic execution.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) involved
      in the boss encounter.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss identifier (GUID) involved
      in the boss encounter.
  - name: mechanic
    description: MechanicType enum value specifying which type of boss mechanic should
      be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Mechanic Execution
    code: DungeonScriptMgr::instance()->ExecuteBossMechanic(&playerGuid, &bossGuid,
      MECHANIC_STUN);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the dungeon encounter scripting system and
    may be invoked from various boss AI scripts or event handlers. It's important
    to ensure that player and boss GUIDs are valid before calling this method to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of player or boss GUIDs can lead to crashes or unexpected
    behavior. The MechanicType parameter must be a valid enum value supported by the
    system, otherwise the mechanic may not execute correctly.
