api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateMaximumReputation
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateMaximumReputation(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can complete a quest based on their maximum reputation
    cap.
  description: The ValidateMaximumReputation method checks if a given player has reached
    or exceeded the maximum reputation threshold required to complete a specific quest.
    This validation ensures that players cannot progress quests beyond their current
    reputation level, which is a core game mechanic in World of Warcraft's quest system.
    The method typically evaluates the player's standing with relevant factions and
    compares it against the quest's reputation requirements. It returns true if the
    player meets all necessary reputation conditions, otherwise false. This check
    is often performed during quest completion validation to prevent exploits or unintended
    progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must be a valid
      quest ID present in the game's database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose reputation
      is being checked. Must not be null and must represent an active player character.
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient reputation to complete the specified
    quest, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the player's
    faction standings are insufficient for quest progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateMaximumReputation(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can complete quest 12345\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player lacks required reputation\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not have sufficient reputation to complete this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestComplete(uint32 questId) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateMaximumReputation(questId,\
      \ this)) {\n        SendNotification(\"Quest cannot be completed due to insufficient\
      \ reputation.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest\
      \ completion logic\n    CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's faction standing data stored
    in the database and may involve caching mechanisms for performance. The validation
    process typically checks against the maximum reputation level that can be earned
    for each faction associated with the quest. Implementation details may vary depending
    on how TrinityCore handles faction reputation thresholds.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent crashes. Be aware that reputation requirements might change based on expansion
    content or server settings, so this validation should be robust against such variations.
