  signature: void SmoothPhasing::ClearViewerDependentInfo(ObjectGuid seer)
documentation:
  brief: Clears viewer-dependent phasing information for a specified object guid.
  description: The ClearViewerDependentInfo method removes all phasing data that is
    specific to a particular viewer (seer) within the SmoothPhasing system. This function
    ensures that when an object's visibility state changes or when a player logs out,
    the associated phasing dependencies are properly cleaned up to prevent memory
    leaks and incorrect visibility behavior. It is typically invoked during object
    destruction or when transitioning between different phasing states.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The ObjectGuid of the viewer whose dependent phasing information
      should be cleared. This represents the player or unit that was observing the
      phased object.
  returns: null
  examples:

      \    sSmoothPhasing->ClearViewerDependentInfo(seerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmoothPhasing system which manages how objects
    are phased for different players in World of Warcraft. It's important to call
    this method when removing or updating phasing data to maintain consistency and
    avoid stale references.
