documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to retrieve quest line information for a specific
    UI map.
  description: The HandleUiMapQuestLinesRequest method handles incoming packets from
    the client that request quest line data associated with a particular UI map. This
    functionality is used by the game's quest tracking system to display active quests
    and their progression on the minimap or quest log interface. The method typically
    retrieves relevant quest information based on the player's current location and
    active quests, then sends back structured data containing quest line details such
    as quest IDs, objectives, and visual indicators for the UI. This method is part
    of the core quest management system in TrinityCore and directly impacts how quest
    information appears to players in the user interface.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleUiMapQuestLinesRequest(WorldPackets::Quest::UiMapQuestLinesRequest&\
      \ uiMapQuestLinesRequest)\n{\n    // Process the request to get quest lines\
      \ for the current map\n    SendQuestLinesForMap(uiMapQuestLinesRequest.MapID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player opens their quest log or minimap,
    and it's important that the implementation efficiently filters active quests based
    on player state and map boundaries. The method should be thread-safe as it operates
    within the session context.
  warnings: Improper handling of this request may result in incorrect quest tracking
    information being displayed to players. Ensure that all quest line data is properly
    validated before sending to prevent UI corruption or client-side crashes.
