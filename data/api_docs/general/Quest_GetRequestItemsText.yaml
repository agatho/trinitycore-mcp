documentation:
  brief: Returns the request items text associated with a quest
  description: The GetRequestItemsText method retrieves the text that appears in the
    quest log when a player is required to collect specific items for a quest. This
    text typically describes what items are needed and how many of them are required.
    The method is commonly used in quest scripts and quest-related code to provide
    contextual information about item requirements. It's part of the standard quest
    API in TrinityCore and should be used within the context of quest handling logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const std::string& representing the request items text for the
    quest, which is typically used in quest log displays to inform players about required
    items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate();

      std::string requestText = quest->GetRequestItemsText();

      // requestText now contains the text describing item requirements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like GetTitle() or GetDescription() to provide complete quest information. It's
    thread-safe as long as the quest object itself is not modified during execution.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method in quest scripts, as it may return an
    empty string if no item requirements are specified for the quest. Also note that
    the returned string is read-only and should not be modified directly.
