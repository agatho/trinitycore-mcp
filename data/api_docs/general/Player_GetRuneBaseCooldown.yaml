  class: Player
  method: GetRuneBaseCooldown
  signature: uint32 Player::GetRuneBaseCooldown() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base cooldown time for player's runes.
  description: This method retrieves the base cooldown duration in milliseconds for
    a player's runes. It represents the fundamental cooldown period that applies to
    all rune types, regardless of class or specialization. The value returned is used
    in calculating the actual cooldown time for each rune type, which can be modified
    by various factors such as talent bonuses, gear effects, and buffs. Understanding
    this base cooldown is crucial for managing rune usage and optimizing gameplay
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the base cooldown time in milliseconds for player's runes. This
    value typically represents a fixed duration that serves as the foundation for
    calculating individual rune cooldowns, with common values being 10000ms (10 seconds)
    or 15000ms (15 seconds).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 baseCooldown = player->GetRuneBaseCooldown();\n// baseCooldown will\
      \ be 10000 or 15000 milliseconds depending on the player's class\nif (baseCooldown\
      \ == 10000)\n{\n    // Handle 10 second cooldown case\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ 15 second cooldown case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other rune-related methods
    to calculate actual cooldown times. Implementation details may vary based on class-specific
    mechanics and player's specialization. This method should be called carefully
    as it directly affects the timing of rune usage during combat.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining actual cooldown times,
    as real cooldowns are affected by various factors including talent bonuses, gear
    effects, and buffs. The returned value is a base value that may need to be adjusted
    based on game mechanics.
