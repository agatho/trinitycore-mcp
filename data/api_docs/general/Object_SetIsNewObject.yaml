documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the object is newly created or not, affecting its initialization
    state in the game world.
  description: This method controls the internal flag that determines if an object
    has been newly created and should be treated as such for game mechanics purposes.
    It is typically used during object creation or when resetting an object's state
    to ensure proper handling of new object initialization. The method affects how
    the object interacts with the game world, particularly in terms of object visibility
    and state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Object as New
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->SetIsNewObject(true);

      // Object is now marked as newly created'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically modifies internal flags that are used by TrinityCore's
    object system to determine whether an object should be treated as new during initialization.
    It may affect how the object interacts with other systems, such as the client-side
    object visibility or server-side object state management.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object state handling,
    potentially causing issues with object visibility or game mechanics. Ensure that
    this flag is set correctly during object creation or reset operations.
