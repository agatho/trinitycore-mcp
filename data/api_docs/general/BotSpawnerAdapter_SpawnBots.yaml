  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SpawnBots
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerAdapter::SpawnBots(const int & requests)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a specified number of AI-controlled bots in the game world.
  description: The SpawnBots method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    given number of AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft
    server environment. This method typically manages bot creation, assigns them to
    appropriate factions, and ensures they are properly integrated into the game world.
    It may handle resource allocation, memory management, and synchronization with
    existing game systems. The method is commonly used in automated testing scenarios,
    bot-based gameplay modes, or administrative tools for managing NPC populations.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: The number of bots to spawn. This parameter determines how many AI-controlled
      entities will be created and added to the game world.
  returns: Returns the actual number of bots successfully spawned. This value may
    differ from the requested count if spawning fails for any reason, such as resource
    constraints or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;

      uint32 spawnedCount = spawner.SpawnBots(5);

      // Spawns 5 bots and returns the actual number successfully created'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nint requestCount = 10;\nuint32 result = spawner.SpawnBots(requestCount);\n\
      if (result < static_cast<uint32>(requestCount)) {\n    // Handle partial spawn\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Only %u of %d bots were spawned.\"\
      , result, requestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when spawning large numbers
    of bots simultaneously. It's recommended to batch spawn requests or implement
    rate limiting in high-traffic environments. The method should be called from a
    thread-safe context, as bot creation involves interaction with core game systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with very large values for 'requests' may cause server
    performance degradation or resource exhaustion. Ensure proper validation of input
    parameters before calling to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
