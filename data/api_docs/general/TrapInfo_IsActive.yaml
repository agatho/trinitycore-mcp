  method: IsActive
  signature: bool TrapInfo::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the trap is currently active and functional.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a trap object is currently active
    and capable of triggering. This method evaluates the internal state of the trap
    to ascertain whether it has been deployed, is not expired, and remains in a functional
    condition. In World of Warcraft's context, this would typically be used to verify
    that a trap set by a player or NPC is still operational and can be triggered by
    nearby players or creatures. The method does not modify any state; it only reads
    the current status of the trap object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trap is currently active and functional, false otherwise.
    An inactive trap may have been disarmed, expired, or removed from the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trap Status Check
    code: "if (trapInfo->IsActive()) {\n    // Proceed with trap logic\n    trapInfo->Trigger();\n\
      } else {\n    // Trap is not active, skip trigger\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Traps
    code: "for (auto& trap : playerTraps) {\n    if (trap->IsActive()) {\n       \
      \ trap->Trigger();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with trap deployment and trigger
    logic. It's important to note that a trap may be marked as active but not yet
    ready to trigger due to cooldowns or other game mechanics. The implementation
    likely checks internal flags or timers to determine the current state.
  warnings: Do not assume that an active trap will always trigger immediately upon
    activation. Traps may have cooldown periods, range restrictions, or other conditions
    that must be met before they can be triggered. Always validate trap conditions
    before attempting to activate them.
