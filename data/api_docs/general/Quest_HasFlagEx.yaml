documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest has a specific flag.
  description: This method determines whether a quest possesses a particular flag
    from the QuestFlagsEx enumeration. It is commonly used to verify quest properties
    or requirements before processing quest-related actions. The method returns true
    if the specified flag is present in the quest's flags, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is essential for quest handling logic within TrinityCore's core
    systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has the specified flag, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->HasFlagEx(QUEST_FLAG_EX_SPECIAL)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a bitwise check against the quest's flags, making it
    efficient for flag validation. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    other quest-related functions to determine quest eligibility or completion status.
  warnings: This method should not be used to check for flags that are not defined
    in QuestFlagsEx enumeration; using invalid flag values may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
