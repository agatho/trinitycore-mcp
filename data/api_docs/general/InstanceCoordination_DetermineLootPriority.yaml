  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: DetermineLootPriority
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::DetermineLootPriority(Group * group, uint32
    itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and assigns loot priority for items within a group instance.
  description: The DetermineLootPriority method calculates and sets the appropriate
    loot distribution priority for a specified item among players in a group during
    instance coordination. This method ensures that loot is distributed fairly according
    to predefined rules, such as need-before-greed systems or specific group member
    roles. It typically integrates with TrinityCore's loot system to manage item assignment
    based on player participation, role, and other relevant factors within the group
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players participating
      in the instance. Must be a valid group with members.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the item for which loot priority is
      being determined. Must correspond to an existing item in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      instanceCoordination->DetermineLootPriority(group, itemId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot tables and group loot settings.
    It may be called during loot distribution events or when a new item is added to
    the group's loot pool.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid itemId could lead to undefined behavior or errors in
    loot assignment.
