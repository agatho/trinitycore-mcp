  class: TargetSelector
  method: SelectInterruptTarget
  signature: SelectionResult TargetSelector::SelectInterruptTarget(float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the best target to interrupt based on priority and range.
  description: The SelectInterruptTarget method identifies and returns the most suitable
    enemy target for an interrupt ability or spell. It evaluates potential targets
    within the specified maximum range, considering factors such as threat level,
    proximity, and target priority. This method is typically used by AI-controlled
    creatures or players to determine which unit should be interrupted next when casting
    a spell that can be interrupted. The selection process prioritizes targets with
    higher threat levels and those closer to the caster, ensuring optimal combat efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: maxRange
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) within which targets will be considered
      for interruption. Targets beyond this range are ignored.
  returns: A SelectionResult object containing the selected target, or an invalid
    selection if no suitable target was found within the specified range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectInterruptTarget
    code: "SelectionResult result = selector.SelectInterruptTarget(30.0f);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the selected target\n    Unit* target\
      \ = result.GetTarget();\n    // Perform interrupt logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SelectInterruptTarget in a spell cast routine
    code: "void CastInterruptibleSpell() {\n    SelectionResult interruptTarget =\
      \ selector.SelectInterruptTarget(25.0f);\n    if (interruptTarget.IsValid())\
      \ {\n        Unit* target = interruptTarget.GetTarget();\n        if (target\
      \ && target->IsInFront(me)) {\n            // Interrupt the target's spell\n\
      \            DoCast(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in AI decision-making processes and should
    be called frequently during combat to ensure timely interruption of enemy spells.
    The selection algorithm may vary depending on the specific implementation of TargetSelector,
    but generally favors targets with higher threat levels or those that are directly
    in front of the caster.
  warnings: Ensure that maxRange is set appropriately for the spell being used; too
    small a range may prevent interruption of valid targets, while too large a range
    might select distant irrelevant targets. The method does not validate if the selected
    target is actually casting an interruptible spell, so additional checks should
    be performed before attempting to interrupt.
