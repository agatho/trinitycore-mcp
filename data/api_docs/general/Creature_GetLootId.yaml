  class: Creature
  method: GetLootId
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetLootId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot id associated with the creature, used for determining loot
    distribution in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetLootId method retrieves the unique identifier that defines the
    loot table for a specific creature. This identifier is crucial for determining
    which items a creature will drop when defeated, and it directly corresponds to
    the loot template defined in the database. The method is typically used by the
    game engine to fetch the appropriate loot data from the database when a creature
    is killed, ensuring proper loot distribution according to the creature's loot
    settings. It does not return the actual loot items themselves but rather the identifier
    that links to the loot template.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 loot id which represents the unique identifier linking
    to the creature's loot template in the database. This value determines what loot
    items will be dropped when the creature is killed, and it corresponds to the 'lootid'
    field in the creature_loot_template table.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 lootId = creature->GetLootId();\nif (lootId > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ loot based on the retrieved id\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Creature class and is typically called during
    creature death or loot generation processes. It should be used in conjunction
    with other loot-related methods to properly handle loot distribution. Performance
    considerations are minimal since this is a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: This method does not return actual loot items but rather the identifier
    that links to the loot template; developers must ensure proper handling of loot
    templates when using this method.
