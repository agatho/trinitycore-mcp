  brief: Moves a LFGRoleDetector object to another LFGRoleDetector object, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The LFGRoleDetector move constructor is used to transfer the internal
    state and resources from one LFGRoleDetector instance to another. This operation
    is typically performed when an LFGRoleDetector object is being initialized with
    an rvalue reference to another LFGRoleDetector instance. The source object is
    left in a valid but unspecified state after the move, meaning it should not be
    used for further operations unless reinitialized. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this class likely handles role detection logic for LFG (Looking for
    Group) systems, where moving objects efficiently avoids unnecessary copying and
    improves performance during group formation processes.

  - title: Move Constructing a LFGRoleDetector
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector1;

      // ... perform operations on detector1 ...

      LFGRoleDetector detector2 = std::move(detector1); // Move detector1 to detector2

      // detector1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's important
    to note that after moving, the source object should not be used unless explicitly
    reinitialized. The move constructor ensures efficient resource transfer without
    deep copying.
