documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and finalization tasks when a warrior's combat session ends
  description: The OnCombatEndSpecific method is invoked when a warrior character
    exits combat mode, allowing for specific post-combat actions to be executed. This
    method typically handles resource management, state resets, and cleanup of combat-specific
    data or effects. It ensures that the warrior's AI state is properly synchronized
    with the end of combat, including resetting any temporary buffs, clearing combat
    flags, and potentially triggering cooldowns or recovery mechanics. The method
    serves as a critical component in maintaining proper game state consistency during
    transitions from active combat to idle status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat End Handler
    code: "void MyWarriorAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    // Perform general cleanup\n  \
      \  OnCombatEndSpecific();\n    // Additional custom logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called as part of the standard combat end sequence
    to ensure proper state management. It is typically invoked by the core combat
    system when a unit's combat state transitions from active to inactive. Developers
    should avoid calling this method directly unless implementing custom combat handling
    logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of combat end events may lead to inconsistent AI behavior
    or resource leaks. Ensure that all combat-specific resources are properly released
    before calling this method, as it may reset internal state variables.
