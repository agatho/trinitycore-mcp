  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::AdvanceBossPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Advances the current boss phase in the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
  description: The AdvanceBossPhase method is responsible for progressing the combat
    phase of a boss encounter within the AdvancedBehaviorManager system. This method
    typically handles the transition logic between different stages of a boss fight,
    such as moving from phase 1 to phase 2, and may trigger associated events, updates
    to NPC behavior, or changes in combat mechanics. It is commonly used in scripted
    boss encounters where multiple phases are defined with distinct behaviors, abilities,
    or health thresholds. The method does not accept any parameters and performs its
    operation internally based on the current state of the boss encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Encounter
    code: "class MyBossAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        // Initialize boss encounter\n        me->SetPhaseMask(1,\
      \ true);\n        // Begin first phase\n    }\n\n    void DamageTaken(Unit*\
      \ attacker, uint32& damage) override\n    {\n        if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 50.0f)\n        {\n            // Advance to next boss phase\n         \
      \   sAdvancedBehaviorManager->AdvanceBossPhase();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during boss encounter logic when certain
    conditions are met, such as health thresholds or specific combat events. It should
    only be called from within a valid boss encounter context to ensure proper behavior
    and avoid unintended side effects.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active boss encounter may result in
    undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the boss encounter is properly initialized
    before invoking AdvanceBossPhase.
