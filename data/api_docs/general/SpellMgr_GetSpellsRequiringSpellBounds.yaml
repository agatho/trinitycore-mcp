    spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bounds of spells that require a specific spell to be present
    in the spell map.
  description: This method returns a SpellsRequiringSpellMapBounds object which contains
    the lower and upper bounds of spell entries in the internal spell map that have
    a dependency on the specified spell ID. It is used internally by the SpellMgr
    class to efficiently query spells that require another spell, typically for validation
    or processing during spell initialization or modification. The returned bounds
    are useful for iterating over a subset of spells that meet certain criteria without
    having to scan the entire spell database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellsRequiringSpellMapBounds object representing the range of spell
    entries in the internal spell map that depend on a specific spell ID. This structure
    typically contains two iterators or indices defining the start and end of the
    matching spell entries.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell bounds for dependency checking
    code: "SpellsRequiringSpellMapBounds bounds = spellMgr.GetSpellsRequiringSpellBounds(12345);\n\
      for (auto it = bounds.first; it != bounds.second; ++it)\n{\n    uint32 dependentSpellId\
      \ = it->first;\n    // Process each spell that requires spell ID 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the internal spell map has been properly initialized
    and populated with spell data. It is designed for performance-critical operations
    where efficient range-based lookups are required. The returned bounds should be
    used directly in range-based loops or similar iteration patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to an existing
    spell in the database, as invalid spell IDs may result in empty ranges or undefined
    behavior depending on implementation details. This method is not thread-safe and
    should only be called from within a synchronized context if used concurrently.
