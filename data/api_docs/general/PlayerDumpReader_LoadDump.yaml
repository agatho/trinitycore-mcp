  class: PlayerDumpReader
  method: LoadDump
  signature: DumpReturn PlayerDumpReader::LoadDump(std::istream & input, int account,
    std::string name, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes a player dump from an input stream into the database
  description: The LoadDump method reads player data from a provided input stream
    and imports it into the TrinityCore database for the specified account and character
    name. It handles parsing of the dump format, validation of data integrity, and
    creation of new entries in the appropriate tables. This method is typically used
    for importing character data during server maintenance or migration operations.
    The method requires valid account ID, character name, and GUID to properly associate
    the imported data with existing or new database records.
  parameters:
  - name: input
    description: Input stream containing the player dump data in a format compatible
      with TrinityCore's import system
  - name: account
    description: The account ID to associate the character with. Must be a valid existing
      account in the database
  - name: name
    description: The character name to assign to the imported data. Must be unique
      within the account's roster
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier for the character. Should be a unique
      value not currently in use in the database
  returns: DumpReturn enum indicating success or failure of the import operation.
    Possible values include DUMP_SUCCESS, DUMP_ERROR_INVALID_DATA, DUMP_ERROR_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND,
    DUMP_ERROR_NAME_EXISTS, and DUMP_ERROR_DB_FAILURE
  examples:
  - title: Basic player dump loading
    code: "std::ifstream file(\"player_dump.txt\");\nPlayerDumpReader reader;\nDumpReturn\
      \ result = reader.LoadDump(file, 12345, \"MyCharacter\", 67890);\nif (result\
      \ == DUMP_SUCCESS) {\n    std::cout << \"Character imported successfully\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Import failed with error code: \"\
      \ << result << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs validation checks on the input data to ensure database
    integrity. It may throw exceptions if critical errors occur during parsing or
    database operations. The method assumes that the input stream is properly formatted
    and contains valid player data in TrinityCore's expected dump format.
  warnings: Ensure that the account ID exists before calling this method, otherwise
    it will likely fail with an account not found error. Also ensure that the character
    name and GUID are unique to avoid conflicts in the database. Improperly formatted
    input streams may cause undefined behavior or database corruption.
