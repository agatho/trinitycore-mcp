documentation:
  brief: Puts the pet AI into evade mode, causing the pet to return to its owner and
    cease attacking.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used in the PetAI class to transition
    a pet's AI behavior into an evade state. When invoked, this method instructs the
    pet to stop its current combat actions, return to its owner's side, and disengage
    from any targets it was attacking. This typically occurs when the pet's owner
    is no longer in combat or when certain conditions are met that cause the pet to
    retreat. The method does not take any parameters and performs internal logic to
    manage the pet's movement and AI state.

    code: 'PetAI* petAI = ...;

      petAI->EnterEvadeMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a pet needs to be removed from combat, such as when the owner leaves combat or
    when the pet's health drops below a certain threshold. It may also be invoked
    in response to specific game events or commands.
