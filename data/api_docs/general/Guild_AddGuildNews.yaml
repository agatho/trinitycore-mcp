  class: Guild
  method: AddGuildNews
  signature: void Guild::AddGuildNews(uint8 type, int guid, uint32 flags, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new guild news entry to the guild's broadcast list with specified
    type, guid, flags, and value.
  description: The AddGuildNews method is used to insert a new entry into the guild's
    news system, which is typically displayed in the guild roster and chat channels.
    This method allows for various types of guild-related announcements such as member
    join/leave events, achievements, or custom messages. The parameters control the
    type of news item, the associated GUID (often a player's identifier), flags that
    define additional properties or visibility settings, and a value field that may
    contain specific data depending on the news type. This functionality is integral
    to maintaining communication within a guild and informing members about important
    events or updates.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of guild news entry. Valid values are typically
      defined by constants such as GUILD_NEWS_SUMMON, GUILD_NEWS_JOINED, etc., indicating
      different categories like member events, achievements, or system messages.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the entity associated with
      the news entry. For player-related news, this would typically be the player's
      GUID; for other types it might refer to an item, achievement, or event identifier.
  - name: flags
    description: Additional flags that modify how the news entry is processed or displayed.
      These may control visibility, priority, or special handling of the news item
      within the guild interface.
  - name: value
    description: A numeric value associated with the news entry. The meaning of this
      value depends on the news type and can represent things like achievement points,
      item levels, or other relevant data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a player join notification
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...; // Assume valid guild pointer

      uint8 newsType = GUILD_NEWS_JOINED;

      int playerGuid = 123456;

      uint32 flags = 0;

      uint32 value = 0;

      guild->AddGuildNews(newsType, playerGuid, flags, value);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding an achievement announcement
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      uint8 newsType = GUILD_NEWS_ACHIEVEMENT;

      int playerGuid = 789012;

      uint32 flags = GUILD_NEWS_FLAG_ACHIEVEMENT;

      uint32 value = 500; // Achievement points

      guild->AddGuildNews(newsType, playerGuid, flags, value);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the guild's news cache and
    may broadcast the message to all online guild members. It is typically called
    during events like player joins, achievements, or other significant guild activities.
    The implementation might involve database writes for persistent storage of news
    entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid entity in the game
    world, as invalid GUIDs could lead to display issues or errors. Also, be cautious
    with flag values that may have specific meanings and should not be arbitrarily
    set.
