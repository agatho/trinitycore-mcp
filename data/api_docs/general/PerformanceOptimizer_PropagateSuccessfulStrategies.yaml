  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: PropagateSuccessfulStrategies
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::PropagateSuccessfulStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Propagates successful performance optimization strategies throughout the
    system.
  description: The PropagateSuccessfulStrategies method distributes optimized performance
    techniques that have been identified as effective across various subsystems within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked after performance
    analysis or benchmarking processes to apply proven optimizations. It ensures that
    successful strategy implementations are consistently applied, improving overall
    system efficiency and reducing redundant computations. The method operates on
    internal strategy caches and may update configuration settings or runtime parameters
    based on the propagation results.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.PropagateSuccessfulStrategies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after performance analysis has been completed
    and successful strategies have been identified. It may modify internal state and
    configuration values, so it's recommended to call it during maintenance windows
    or when system load is low.
  warnings: Calling this method in high-traffic scenarios without proper pre-analysis
    could lead to unexpected behavior or performance degradation. Ensure that all
    strategies being propagated are thoroughly tested before execution.
