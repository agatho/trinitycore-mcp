documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AstralPowerResource class with default
    values.
  description: The AstralPowerResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AstralPowerResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the resource,
    including initializing power values, resetting counters, and preparing the object
    for use within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that all member
    variables are properly initialized to their default states, which is essential
    for maintaining consistent behavior when managing astral power resources in World
    of Warcraft gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AstralPowerResource instance
    code: 'AstralPowerResource powerResource;

      // The constructor is automatically called here, initializing all internal values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AstralPowerResource in a spell effect context
    code: "class MySpellEffect\n{\npublic:\n    void ApplyEffect(Unit* target)\n \
      \   {\n        AstralPowerResource resource;\n        // Use resource for managing\
      \ astral power during spell application\n        resource.SetPower(100);\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating instances
    of AstralPowerResource. Developers should be aware that the default initialization
    may vary based on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's resource management
    system. The constructor does not perform any validation or error checking, so
    it's expected that the calling code ensures proper usage context.
