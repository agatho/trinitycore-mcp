  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateAverages()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal average tracking values for leader-follow behavior mechanics
  description: The UpdateAverages method recalculates and refreshes internal statistical
    averages used by the LeaderFollowBehavior class to manage group movement and positioning.
    This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that follower
    positioning calculations remain accurate based on recent leader movement data.
    It processes recent position deltas and updates running averages for distance,
    direction, and speed metrics that govern how followers maintain formation relative
    to their leader.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update cycle
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_leaderFollowBehavior)\n        m_leaderFollowBehavior->UpdateAverages();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active AI update cycles to maintain
    synchronization with current leader movement data. The internal averaging calculations
    may involve floating-point operations that could introduce minor precision variations
    over time.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper AI update contexts may result in
    inconsistent follower positioning behavior. Ensure that the leader's position
    and movement data are valid before invoking this method.
