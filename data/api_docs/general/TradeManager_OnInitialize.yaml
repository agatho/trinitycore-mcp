documentation:
  brief: Initializes the trade manager system and sets up required resources for handling
    player trades
  description: The OnInitialize method is responsible for setting up the TradeManager's
    internal state and resources when the module is loaded. This method typically
    performs initialization tasks such as registering event handlers, loading configuration
    settings, initializing data structures, and preparing the trade system to handle
    incoming trade requests. It ensures that all necessary components are ready before
    the trade functionality becomes available to players. The method should only be
    called once during the server startup process, and subsequent calls may have no
    effect or could result in undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly set up; returns false if an error occurred during initialization
    that prevented the trade manager from being ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "TradeManager* tradeMgr = new TradeManager();\nif (tradeMgr->OnInitialize())\
      \ {\n    // Trade system is ready\n    printf(\"Trade manager initialized successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ initialize trade manager\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server startup or module loading.
    It is not thread-safe and should be executed in the main server thread. The method
    may perform blocking operations during initialization, so it's recommended to
    call it during server boot sequence rather than runtime.
  warnings: Calling OnInitialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    resource leaks or inconsistent state. This method should never be called from
    within a trade processing context as it might cause deadlocks or race conditions.
