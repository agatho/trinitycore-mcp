documentation:
  brief: Initializes all Cataclysm expansion mounts for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializeCataclysmMounts method sets up and registers all mount
    entries specific to the Cataclysm expansion within the MountManager system. This
    includes loading mount data, applying expansion-specific attributes, and ensuring
    proper integration with the player's mount collection. The method is typically
    called during server initialization or when a new player character is created
    to ensure that all Cataclysm mounts are available for acquisition and use. It
    handles the internal setup of mount IDs, display information, and any prerequisite
    conditions required for these mounts to be obtainable by players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager mountMgr;

      mountMgr.InitializeCataclysmMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It modifies
    internal mount data structures and is not thread-safe. The method assumes that
    the Cataclysm expansion data files are properly loaded in the game environment.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times as it may cause duplicate entries
    or memory issues. Ensure all prerequisite systems (like expansion data loading)
    are initialized before calling this method.
