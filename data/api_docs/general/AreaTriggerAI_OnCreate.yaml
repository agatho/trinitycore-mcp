  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: OnCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::OnCreate(const Spell * creatingSpell)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AreaTriggerAI instance when an area trigger is created by
    a spell.
  description: The OnCreate method is called when an AreaTriggerAI instance is initialized
    after an area trigger has been spawned by a spell. This method provides the AI
    with access to the creating spell that generated the area trigger, allowing for
    custom behavior based on the spell's properties, effects, or caster. It serves
    as the primary entry point for setting up the AI logic and can be overridden by
    derived classes to implement specific area trigger behaviors. The method is invoked
    during the area trigger's construction phase, before it begins executing its periodic
    or one-time actions.
  parameters:
  - name: creatingSpell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object that created this area trigger. This
      parameter provides access to spell properties such as caster, spell effects,
      and duration. Can be null if the area trigger was not created by a spell.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCreate(const\
      \ Spell* creatingSpell) override {\n        if (creatingSpell)\n           \
      \ SetDuration(creatingSpell->GetDuration());\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell-Based Behavior Setup
    code: "class FireballAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI {\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnCreate(const Spell* creatingSpell) override {\n        if (creatingSpell\
      \ && creatingSpell->GetSpellInfo()->Id == 133)\n            SetEffect0Amount(500);\
      \ // Apply custom damage\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called only once during the area trigger's lifetime, immediately
    after its creation. It is important to note that the spell may be null if the
    area trigger was not created by a spell (e.g., from a game event or direct script
    call). Derived classes should always check for null before using the creatingSpell
    parameter.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy operations in OnCreate, as it's called during the
    area trigger initialization phase. Avoid modifying the spell object directly,
    as it may be shared across multiple triggers. Be cautious about accessing spell
    data that might not be fully initialized yet.
