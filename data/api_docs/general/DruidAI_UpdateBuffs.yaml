documentation:
  brief: Updates the Druid AI's buff states and applies appropriate spell buffs based
    on current game conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method in the DruidAI class is responsible for managing
    and applying buffs to the druid character during AI-controlled gameplay. This
    method evaluates the current state of the druid, including health, mana levels,
    combat status, and nearby allies or enemies, to determine which buffs should be
    active. It ensures that the druid maintains optimal performance by applying necessary
    auras such as Thorns, Barkskin, or other defensive or offensive enhancements based
    on situational awareness. The method typically runs periodically during the AI
    update cycle and may interact with the core TrinityCore spell system to cast or
    maintain buffs.

    code: "void DruidAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI update cycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing custom behavior. It relies on internal state tracking
    within the DruidAI class, so calling it outside of normal AI execution may lead
    to inconsistent buff states.
  warnings: Do not call UpdateBuffs directly from player interaction handlers or other
    non-AI contexts, as this can cause unexpected behavior in spell management and
    buff application logic.
