  method: HandleQuestStuckState
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestStuckState(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the stuck state for a player's quest by resetting or updating quest
    progress.
  description: The HandleQuestStuckState method is responsible for managing and resolving
    situations where a player's quest becomes stuck, typically due to client-side
    issues, server synchronization problems, or incomplete quest progression. This
    method ensures that the quest state is properly reset or updated to prevent players
    from being unable to complete or continue their quest objectives. It may involve
    checking quest completion status, resetting quest timers, or reinitializing quest-related
    data structures to restore normal gameplay flow.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      stuck state needs to be handled.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest that is in a stuck state. Used to
      locate and process specific quest data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestStuckState(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "if (player && player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n\
      {\n    DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestStuckState(player, questId);\n    // Additional\
      \ logic to notify player or log event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when a quest is confirmed to be in a stuck
    state. It is recommended to verify the quest status before invoking this function
    to avoid unnecessary processing. The implementation may involve internal checks
    for quest validity and player state consistency.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the quest is actually stuck
    can lead to unintended resets or data corruption. Ensure proper validation of
    the quest state and player context before execution.
