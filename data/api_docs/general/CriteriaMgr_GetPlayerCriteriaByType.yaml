  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: GetPlayerCriteriaByType
  signature: const CriteriaList & CriteriaMgr::GetPlayerCriteriaByType(int type, uint32
    asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of player criteria associated with a specific type and asset.
  description: The GetPlayerCriteriaByType method fetches a collection of criteria
    that are linked to a given criteria type and asset identifier. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's achievement and quest systems where criteria define
    the conditions required to earn rewards. The returned CriteriaList contains all
    matching criteria entries, which can then be iterated over or evaluated for progress
    tracking. This method does not modify any internal state and is typically called
    during player progression checks or when evaluating achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type identifier of the criteria to retrieve. This corresponds
      to predefined criterion types in the game such as kill counts, quest completions,
      or item acquisitions.
  - name: asset
    description: The asset identifier associated with the criteria. This may represent
      a specific NPC, item, zone, or other game object relevant to the criteria definition.
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList containing all criteria entries
    matching the specified type and asset. The list is empty if no matching criteria
    exist.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Kill Count Criteria for a Specific NPC
    code: "const CriteriaList& killCriteria = criteriaMgr.GetPlayerCriteriaByType(CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE,\
      \ 12345);\nfor (const auto& criterion : killCriteria) {\n    // Process each\
      \ kill criterion\n    std::cout << \"Required kills: \" << criterion.requiredCount\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Quest Completion Criteria
    code: "const CriteriaList& questCriteria = criteriaMgr.GetPlayerCriteriaByType(CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ 67890);\nif (!questCriteria.empty()) {\n    // Player has progress on this\
      \ quest\n    for (const auto& criterion : questCriteria) {\n        if (criterion.progress\
      \ >= criterion.requiredCount) {\n            // Quest completed\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, so the returned CriteriaList should
    not be modified. The criteria are typically loaded from database tables and cached
    in memory for performance reasons. It's important to note that the method might
    return an empty list if no criteria match the provided type and asset combination.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'type' and 'asset' parameters are valid identifiers;
    invalid values may lead to unexpected empty results or potential crashes if not
    handled properly in calling code. The returned reference is only valid as long
    as the CriteriaMgr instance remains alive.
