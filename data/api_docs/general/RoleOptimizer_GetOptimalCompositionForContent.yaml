  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: GetOptimalCompositionForContent
  signature: GroupComposition RoleOptimizer::GetOptimalCompositionForContent(uint32
    contentId, bool isDungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal group composition for a specified content
    type, considering dungeon or raid requirements.
  description: The GetOptimalCompositionForContent method evaluates the most effective
    group composition for a given content ID, distinguishing between dungeon and raid
    scenarios. It analyzes player roles, class distributions, and encounter requirements
    to suggest an ideal team makeup. This method is typically used in group finding
    systems or when auto-generating party compositions for specific instances. The
    result is a GroupComposition object that defines the recommended distribution
    of roles and classes within the group. The method considers both player availability
    and content-specific constraints such as required class types, role balance, and
    instance difficulty.
  parameters:
  - name: contentId
    description: Unique identifier for the content (e.g., dungeon, raid, or scenario)
      to determine optimal composition for. This ID corresponds to entries in the
      game's content database.
  - name: isDungeon
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the content is a dungeon (true) or
      a raid (false). This affects how the composition is optimized, as dungeons typically
      require different role distributions than raids.
  returns: A GroupComposition object representing the optimal distribution of roles
    and classes for the specified content. The structure includes information about
    how many tanks, healers, and damage dealers should be included in a group to maximize
    success chances.
  examples:
  - title: Get optimal composition for a dungeon
    code: "GroupComposition comp = roleOptimizer.GetOptimalCompositionForContent(1234,\
      \ true); // For dungeon with ID 1234\nif (comp.IsValid()) {\n    // Use the\
      \ composition to form a group\n    std::cout << \"Recommended tanks: \" << comp.GetTankCount()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Get optimal composition for a raid
    code: "GroupComposition comp = roleOptimizer.GetOptimalCompositionForContent(5678,\
      \ false); // For raid with ID 5678\nif (comp.IsValid()) {\n    // Apply the\
      \ composition logic to player selection\n    std::cout << \"Recommended healers:\
      \ \" << comp.GetHealerCount() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal databases or configurations that define
    optimal compositions for various content types. It may be used in conjunction
    with player role tracking systems to ensure that generated groups meet the necessary
    criteria for success. The method does not modify any state but returns a computed
    result based on current game data.
  warnings: Ensure that the contentId passed is valid and corresponds to existing
    content in the database; otherwise, the returned composition may be invalid or
    default. This method should not be used in performance-critical sections due to
    potential lookup overhead.
