  class: Garrison
  method: GetFaction
  signature: GarrisonFactionIndex Garrison::GetFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the faction index associated with the garrison.
  description: The GetFaction method retrieves the GarrisonFactionIndex that represents
    the faction alignment of the garrison. This index is used internally by TrinityCore
    to determine which faction (Alliance or Horde) the garrison belongs to, affecting
    quest availability, rewards, and other faction-specific mechanics. The method
    does not take any parameters and returns a constant value representing the garrison's
    faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GarrisonFactionIndex enum value indicating the faction of the garrison.
    Typically, this will be either GARRISON_FACTION_INDEX_ALLIANCE or GARRISON_FACTION_INDEX_HORDE,
    depending on the player's faction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GarrisonFactionIndex faction = garrison->GetFaction();\nif (faction ==\
      \ GARRISON_FACTION_INDEX_ALLIANCE)\n{\n    // Handle Alliance garrison logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other garrison-related
    functions to ensure proper faction alignment when performing operations such as
    building placement, mission assignment, or reward distribution. The returned value
    should be treated as read-only and not modified directly.
