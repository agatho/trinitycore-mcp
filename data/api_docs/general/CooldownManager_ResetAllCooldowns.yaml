  method: ResetAllCooldowns
  signature: void CooldownManager::ResetAllCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all active cooldowns for the associated player or unit.
  description: The ResetAllCooldowns method clears all currently active cooldowns
    from the CooldownManager instance, effectively making all abilities and spells
    immediately available for use. This method is typically used during specific game
    events, such as when a player respawns, changes zones, or when certain buffs/debuffs
    are applied or removed. The operation affects only the cooldown state and does
    not modify any other player or unit attributes. It's commonly invoked in scenarios
    where cooldowns need to be forcefully reset regardless of their current duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset all cooldowns for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      CooldownManager* cooldownMgr = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cooldownMgr->ResetAllCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset cooldowns during zone change event
    code: "void OnPlayerZoneChange(Player* player)\n{\n    CooldownManager* mgr =\
      \ player->GetCooldownManager();\n    mgr->ResetAllCooldowns();\n    // Additional\
      \ logic for zone transition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates internal cooldown tracking data structures.
    It should be used carefully to avoid unintended behavior in gameplay mechanics.
    The operation is immediate and does not queue or delay the reset process.
  warnings: Using this method may cause unexpected behavior if cooldowns are expected
    to persist across certain events. Ensure that cooldown resets align with game
    design requirements, especially for abilities with critical timing or balance
    implications.
