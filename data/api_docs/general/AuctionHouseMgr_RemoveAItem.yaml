  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: RemoveAItem
  signature: bool AuctionHouseMgr::RemoveAItem(int itemGuid, bool deleteItem, int
    * trans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from the auction house database and optionally deletes the
    item object.
  description: The RemoveAItem method is responsible for removing an auctioned item
    from the auction house system. It takes the item's GUID as input and removes it
    from the auction database. If the deleteItem flag is set to true, the actual item
    object will also be deleted from the database. The trans parameter can be used
    to pass a transaction handle for database operations, allowing the removal to
    be part of a larger transaction. This method ensures that auction listings are
    properly cleaned up when items are sold, canceled, or removed for other reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item to be removed from the auction
      house. This is typically the database ID of the auctioned item.
  - name: deleteItem
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the actual item object should also
      be deleted from the database. If true, both the auction listing and the item
      itself are removed; if false, only the auction listing is removed.
  - name: trans
    description: Pointer to a transaction handle that can be used for database operations.
      Allows the removal operation to be part of a larger database transaction for
      consistency. Can be null if no transaction is needed.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully removed from the auction house
    system, false otherwise. The method may return false if the item with the specified
    GUID does not exist in the auction database or if there was a database error during
    the removal process.
  examples:
  - title: Remove an auctioned item without deleting the actual item
    code: bool success = sAuctionHouseMgr->RemoveAItem(12345, false, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove an auctioned item and delete the actual item object
    code: 'Transaction* trans = new Transaction();

      bool success = sAuctionHouseMgr->RemoveAItem(67890, true, trans);

      delete trans;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the auction house system when
    items are sold or canceled. The transaction parameter allows for atomic operations
    when removing multiple related items. Ensure that proper locking mechanisms are
    in place if this method is called from multiple threads simultaneously.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the deleteItem flag as it permanently removes the
    item object from the database. Make sure the item is not referenced elsewhere
    before calling with deleteItem=true. Also, ensure that any transaction passed
    to the method is properly managed to avoid database inconsistencies.
