  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: GetAvailableCommands
  signature: int BotChatCommandHandler::GetAvailableCommands(const CommandContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and returns the list of available bot chat commands for the given
    command context.
  description: The GetAvailableCommands method is responsible for enumerating all
    valid bot chat commands that can be executed within the specified CommandContext.
    This method typically filters and prepares a list of commands based on the current
    user's permissions, bot state, or other contextual factors. It serves as a core
    utility for command dispatch systems, allowing the game client or server to dynamically
    present available actions to players controlling bots. The returned integer value
    usually indicates success or failure status of the operation, with positive values
    often representing command count and negative values indicating errors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where positive values typically indicate the number
    of available commands retrieved, and negative values represent error conditions
    such as invalid context or internal failures. A return value of zero may signify
    no commands are available for the given context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int commandCount = botChatCommandHandler.GetAvailableCommands(context);\n\
      if (commandCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the available commands\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found \" << commandCount << \" commands\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse if (commandCount\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // No commands available\n    std::cout << \"No commands available\
      \ for current context\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Error occurred\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Error retrieving commands: \" << commandCount << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal caching or filtering based on the CommandContext
    to optimize performance. Developers should be aware that command availability
    may change dynamically depending on bot state, player permissions, or game conditions.
