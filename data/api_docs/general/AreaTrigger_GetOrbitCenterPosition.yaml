  method: GetOrbitCenterPosition
  signature: const int * AreaTrigger::GetOrbitCenterPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the center position coordinates for an area trigger's orbital path.
  description: The GetOrbitCenterPosition method returns a pointer to an array of
    three integers representing the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the center point around
    which the area trigger orbits. This is typically used in conjunction with orbital
    area triggers that have a defined circular or elliptical path. The returned pointer
    points to internal data and should not be modified directly. The method is safe
    to call during the area trigger's active lifecycle, but may return null if the
    area trigger has not been initialized with orbital parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of three integers representing the X, Y, and
    Z coordinates of the orbit center position. Returns nullptr if the area trigger
    does not have orbital parameters defined or is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nconst int* centerPos = trigger->GetOrbitCenterPosition();\n\
      if (centerPos)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Orbit Center: X=\" << centerPos[0] <<\
      \ \", Y=\" << centerPos[1] << \", Z=\" << centerPos[2] << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Orbit Parameters
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nconst int* centerPos = trigger->GetOrbitCenterPosition();\n\
      if (centerPos)\n{\n    // Use the center position for calculations\n    float\
      \ centerX = static_cast<float>(centerPos[0]);\n    float centerY = static_cast<float>(centerPos[1]);\n\
      \    float centerZ = static_cast<float>(centerPos[2]);\n    \n    // Example:\
      \ Calculate distance from player to orbit center\n    Player* player = ...;\n\
      \    float distance = sqrt(pow(player->GetPositionX() - centerX, 2) + pow(player->GetPositionY()\
      \ - centerY, 2));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal memory managed by the AreaTrigger
    object. It is valid only as long as the area trigger exists and has orbital parameters
    set. The method assumes that the area trigger's orbit center has been properly
    initialized during creation or setup. This function is commonly used in custom
    area trigger scripts where precise positioning and orbital behavior are required.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array directly, as it points to internal data.
    Accessing the pointer after the AreaTrigger object has been destroyed results
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the area trigger actually has orbital parameters
    defined before calling this method, otherwise it will return nullptr.
