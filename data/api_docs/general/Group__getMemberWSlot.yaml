documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a writable iterator to a group member slot by GUID.
  description: The _getMemberWSlot method is an internal utility function within the
    Group class that provides a writable iterator to a specific group member identified
    by their GUID. This allows for direct manipulation of the member data within the
    group's internal container structure. The method is typically used internally
    by other group management functions to access and modify member information without
    requiring additional lookups. It operates on the assumption that the provided
    GUID corresponds to an existing group member, and accessing a non-existent member
    may result in undefined behavior or iterator invalidation.
  parameters:
  - name: Guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to locate within
      the group. This should correspond to a valid player GUID that is currently a
      member of the group.
  returns: A writable iterator (member_witerator) pointing to the group member slot
    associated with the provided GUID. If the GUID does not correspond to any existing
    member, the behavior is undefined and may result in an invalid iterator or crash.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a Group Member for Modification
    code: "Group* group = ...; // Assume group is valid\nuint64 playerGuid = 123456789ULL;\n\
      member_witerator memberIter = group->_getMemberWSlot(playerGuid);\nif (memberIter\
      \ != group->Begin()) {\n    // Modify the member data directly through the iterator\n\
      \    (*memberIter)->SetOnline(false); // Example modification\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Usage with Existence Check
    code: "Group* group = ...;\nuint64 playerGuid = 123456789ULL;\nif (group->IsMember(playerGuid))\
      \ {\n    member_witerator memberIter = group->_getMemberWSlot(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // Proceed with safe modification\n    (*memberIter)->SetLevel(80); //\
      \ Example safe operation\n} else {\n    // Handle case where player is not in\
      \ the group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail and should not be called
    directly by external code. It returns a raw iterator which must be used carefully
    to avoid invalidating the container or causing memory corruption. The returned
    iterator is only valid as long as the group structure remains unchanged and no
    other operations modify the member list.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation can lead to undefined behavior,
    including crashes or memory corruption. Never assume that a GUID corresponds to
    an existing member; always validate membership before calling this function. The
    returned iterator should not be stored for long-term use as group modifications
    may invalidate it.
