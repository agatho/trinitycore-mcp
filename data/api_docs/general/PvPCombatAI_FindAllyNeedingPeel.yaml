documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a pointer to the GUID of an ally player who needs to be
    peeled from combat.
  description: The FindAllyNeedingPeel method is used in PvPCombatAI to identify and
    return a pointer to the GUID of an allied player who requires assistance or removal
    from combat. This method is typically invoked during PvP encounters where strategic
    peel management is required, such as when an ally is being overwhelmed by enemies
    and needs to be rescued or pulled away from dangerous situations. The method likely
    evaluates the health status, positioning, and threat level of nearby allies to
    determine which one should be prioritized for peeling. It's part of a larger combat
    AI system designed to optimize PvP performance by making tactical decisions about
    player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the ally player who needs to be peeled from combat. If no suitable ally is
    found, it may return nullptr or a default value indicating no action is required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in PvP AI logic
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = ...;\nint* allyGuid = ai->FindAllyNeedingPeel(nullptr);\n\
      if (allyGuid != nullptr) {\n    // Process peeling of the identified ally\n\
      \    Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(*allyGuid));\n\
      \    // Perform peel action on targetPlayer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a tactical AI system that makes real-time decisions
    during PvP combat. It may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    considerations are important. The method assumes the existence of a valid combat
    context and may rely on internal state tracking of nearby players.
  warnings: The return value should always be checked for null before dereferencing
    to avoid segmentation faults. Since this is part of an AI system, improper handling
    of the returned GUID could lead to incorrect targeting or peeling decisions in
    PvP scenarios.
