  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::CooldownStackingOptimizer(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CooldownStackingOptimizer instance with the provided BotAI
    context.
  description: The CooldownStackingOptimizer constructor initializes the cooldown
    stacking optimization logic for a bot AI. This class is responsible for managing
    and optimizing the usage of abilities that have cooldowns, ensuring that the bot
    makes optimal use of its available actions while respecting cooldown constraints.
    It typically integrates with the broader BotAI system to determine when and how
    to use abilities based on cooldown states, resource availability, and combat scenarios.
    The initialization process sets up internal data structures and references needed
    for cooldown tracking and decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this optimizer will manage. Must
      not be null and should represent a valid bot AI context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer(botAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or heavy operations.
    It primarily stores the provided BotAI pointer and sets up basic internal state.
    The actual cooldown optimization logic is typically invoked through other methods
    like Update() or ProcessCooldowns().
