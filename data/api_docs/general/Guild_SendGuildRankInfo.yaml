  brief: Sends guild rank information to the specified session.
  description: The SendGuildRankInfo method transmits the current guild's rank hierarchy
    and permissions to a connected player's session. This method is typically invoked
    when a player joins a guild or requests guild information, ensuring that the client
    has up-to-date details about rank levels, their associated privileges, and permission
    settings within the guild context. The data sent includes rank names, permission
    flags, and other relevant guild hierarchy information necessary for client-side
    UI rendering and gameplay logic.

    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendGuildRankInfo(player->GetSession());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal guild data structures and assumes that the
    guild object is properly initialized. It should only be called when the session
    is valid and the player is a member of the guild.
