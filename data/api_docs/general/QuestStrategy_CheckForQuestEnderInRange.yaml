api:
  class: QuestStrategy
  method: CheckForQuestEnderInRange
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::CheckForQuestEnderInRange(BotAI * ai, uint32 npcEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest ender NPC is within range of the bot AI.
  description: The CheckForQuestEnderInRange method evaluates whether a quest ender
    NPC, identified by its entry ID, exists within the specified range of the provided
    BotAI instance. This functionality is crucial for quest completion logic in TrinityCore's
    AI system, particularly when determining if a player or bot can interact with
    an NPC that concludes a quest. The method typically integrates with the broader
    quest state management to ensure proper quest progression and interaction validation.
    It does not require any additional parameters beyond the AI context and NPC entry
    ID.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that represents the bot's AI context.
      This parameter is essential for determining the bot's current position and range
      for checking quest ender NPCs.
  - name: npcEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the NPC that acts as a quest
      ender. This value corresponds to the creature template entry in the database
      and is used to identify specific NPCs within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if a quest ender NPC with the specified entry ID is found
    within the range of the bot AI; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for quest ender
    code: "if (questStrategy.CheckForQuestEnderInRange(ai, 12345)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's current position and range settings to determine
    proximity. It is typically used during quest update cycles or when evaluating
    quest completion conditions.
