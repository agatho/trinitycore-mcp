  class: AuraEffect
  method: CheckEffectProc
  signature: bool AuraEffect::CheckEffectProc(AuraApplication * aurApp, ProcEventInfo
    & eventInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an aura effect should trigger a proc based on the provided
    event information.
  description: The CheckEffectProc method evaluates if a specific aura effect should
    activate its proccing behavior in response to a given event. This method is typically
    called during combat or spell activation events to determine if the aura's periodic
    or triggered effects should be applied. It checks various conditions such as proc
    chances, required spell types, and target restrictions defined by the aura effect.
    The method integrates with TrinityCore's core proc system to ensure proper timing
    and application of aura-based abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura instance
      being evaluated for proc triggering. This contains information about which unit
      has the aura applied and the current state of the aura.
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Reference to a ProcEventInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the event that triggered the proc check, including spell type, damage
      dealt, target, and other relevant combat data.
  returns: Returns true if the aura effect should proc based on the provided event
    information and conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that the aura's proccing behavior will be executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Check Usage
    code: "if (auraEffect->CheckEffectProc(auraApp, eventInfo)) {\n    // Apply proc\
      \ effect\n    auraEffect->HandleProc(auraApp, eventInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Proc Based on Spell Type
    code: "bool shouldProc = auraEffect->CheckEffectProc(auraApp, eventInfo);\nif\
      \ (shouldProc && eventInfo.GetSpellInfo()->IsSpellFlag(SPELL_FLAG_IS_DAMAGING))\
      \ {\n    // Only proc for damaging spells\n    auraEffect->HandleProc(auraApp,\
      \ eventInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core aura processing pipeline in TrinityCore and
    is called frequently during combat events. It should not be used to directly modify
    aura states or apply effects; instead, it determines whether further processing
    is required. The method relies on accurate event data being passed through eventInfo.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the aura application pointer or event information
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that both parameters are valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method. Avoid modifying aura state within this
    method as it may interfere with core proc logic.
