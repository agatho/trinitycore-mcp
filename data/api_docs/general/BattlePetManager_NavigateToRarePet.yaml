  signature: bool BattlePetManager::NavigateToRarePet(int * player, uint32 speciesId)
documentation:
  brief: Navigates the player to a rare battle pet based on species ID.
  description: The NavigateToRarePet method attempts to guide a player to a specific
    rare battle pet identified by its species ID. This functionality is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's Battle Pet system, where players
    can encounter and collect various pets with unique properties. The method likely
    involves pathfinding or teleportation logic to bring the player to the location
    of the specified rare pet. It may check if the player has already obtained the
    pet or if certain conditions are met before initiating navigation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the system.
  - name: speciesId
    description: Unique identifier for the battle pet species to navigate to. This
      corresponds to the Battle Pet Species ID used internally by TrinityCore.
  returns: Returns true if navigation to the rare pet was successfully initiated or
    completed, false otherwise. A return value of false could indicate that the player
    is not eligible for navigation, the pet does not exist, or the system failed to
    locate the pet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 rareSpeciesId = 1234;\nbool success = battlePetManager->NavigateToRarePet(&playerId,\
      \ rareSpeciesId);\nif (success) {\n    // Player is now navigating to the rare\
      \ pet\n} else {\n    // Navigation failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Battle Pet system's internal database
    and may require the player to be in a valid state (e.g., not in combat, not in
    a restricted zone). The implementation might involve checking for existing pet
    collections or quest progress before allowing navigation.
  warnings: Ensure that the speciesId provided is valid and corresponds to an actual
    rare pet. Using invalid IDs can result in undefined behavior or failed navigation
    attempts. Additionally, calling this method during critical gameplay states (like
    combat) may lead to unexpected outcomes.
