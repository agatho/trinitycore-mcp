  class: BotThreatManager
  method: GetBotRole
  signature: ThreatRole BotThreatManager::GetBotRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threat role assigned to the bot within the threat management
    system.
  description: The GetBotRole method returns the current ThreatRole enum value that
    defines how the bot is classified for threat generation and management purposes.
    This role determines the bot's behavior in combat situations, such as whether
    it should focus on tanking, DPS, or support roles. The method provides read-only
    access to the internal role state of the bot's threat manager instance. This information
    is crucial for AI decision-making processes that rely on understanding the bot's
    designated combat role.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ThreatRole enum value indicating the bot's current role classification
    within the threat management system. Possible values typically include TANK, DAMAGE,
    HEALING, or NONE depending on the bot's configuration and current assignment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine bot role
    code: "ThreatRole role = botThreatManager->GetBotRole();\nif (role == TANK)\n\
      {\n    // Bot is assigned as a tank\n    // Adjust AI behavior accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    ThreatRole value reflects the bot's role at the time of method invocation, which
    may change dynamically during gameplay based on combat situations or player commands.
