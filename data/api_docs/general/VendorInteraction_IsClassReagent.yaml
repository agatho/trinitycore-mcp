  class: VendorInteraction
  method: IsClassReagent
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::IsClassReagent(Player * bot, uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified item is classified as a reagent for the player's
    class.
  description: The IsClassReagent method checks if a given item ID corresponds to
    a reagent that is specific to the player's class. This functionality is commonly
    used in vendor interactions and crafting systems within TrinityCore to validate
    whether an item can be used as a reagent for class-specific recipes or abilities.
    The method evaluates the item's properties against the player's class restrictions
    to determine compatibility. It typically relies on internal item data and class-based
    reagent mappings defined in the game's database or configuration files.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      class is used for validation.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being checked for class reagent
      status.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is a reagent appropriate for the player's
    class; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a class reagent
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 itemId =\
      \ 12345;\nbool isReagent = vendorInteraction.IsClassReagent(player, itemId);\n\
      if (isReagent)\n{\n    // Proceed with crafting or vendor interaction logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal item and class data structures to perform
    the check. It may involve database lookups or cached data depending on how TrinityCore
    implements reagent validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the
    itemId corresponds to an actual item in the game's database.
