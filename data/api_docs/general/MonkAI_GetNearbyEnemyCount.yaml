  class: MonkAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: int MonkAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range for the
    Monk AI.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are within a given distance from the Monk AI's
    current position. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    to determine engagement strategies, such as when to use defensive abilities or
    when to initiate combat. The range parameter defines the maximum distance considered
    for enemy detection. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe
    to call during AI update cycles. It relies on the underlying game engine's unit
    tracking system to identify valid enemies within the specified range.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the Monk AI's current position
      to consider for enemy detection. Must be a positive value.
  returns: An integer representing the count of nearby enemy units within the specified
    range. Returns 0 if no enemies are found or if the range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int enemies = monkAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combat Decision
    code: "if (monkAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(8.0f) > 2)\n{\n    // Use defensive ability\n\
      \    monkAI->UseDefensiveAbility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a radius-based search using the game's internal unit
    tracking system, which may have performance implications if called frequently
    with large ranges. The returned count is updated each time the AI processes its
    environment, so it reflects the current state of nearby enemies.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is positive; negative or zero values may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method should not be used
    in performance-critical sections without considering its potential impact on frame
    rate.
