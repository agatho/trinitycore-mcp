  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: IsCompletedCriteriaTree
  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::IsCompletedCriteriaTree(const CriteriaTree * tree)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified criteria tree has been fully completed for
    the current player.
  description: The IsCompletedCriteriaTree method evaluates whether all criteria within
    a given CriteriaTree structure have been met for the active player. This function
    is typically used in achievement and quest systems to check if a complex set of
    conditions has been satisfied. It traverses the criteria tree and verifies each
    individual criterion's completion status. The method returns true only if every
    criterion in the tree is marked as completed, otherwise it returns false. This
    functionality is integral to the World of Warcraft achievement system where players
    must fulfill multiple conditions to earn rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to a CriteriaTree object that represents the set of criteria
      to be evaluated. The tree structure contains nested criteria that must all be
      completed for the method to return true. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if all criteria within the specified tree have been completed
    for the current player, false otherwise. If the input tree is null or invalid,
    behavior is undefined and may result in a crash.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Achievement Completion
    code: "if (player->GetCriteriaHandler()->IsCompletedCriteriaTree(achievementTree))\n\
      {\n    player->CompleteAchievement(achievementId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Progression Logic
    code: "CriteriaTree* questTree = sObjectMgr->GetCriteriaTree(questId);\nif (questTree\
      \ && player->GetCriteriaHandler()->IsCompletedCriteriaTree(questTree))\n{\n\
      \    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs recursive evaluation of criteria trees, which may have
    performance implications for deeply nested structures. The method assumes that
    individual criteria completion status is properly maintained within the CriteriaHandler's
    internal state. It should only be called on valid, initialized criteria trees.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer argument will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crash the application. Ensure that the CriteriaTree pointer is valid
    and properly initialized before invoking this method. Additionally, the method
    does not validate the integrity of the tree structure itself.
