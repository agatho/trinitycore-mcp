  signature: void RoleDefinitions::InitializeMageRoles()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions and configurations specific to Mage class
    characters in the game.
  description: The InitializeMageRoles method sets up all necessary role-related data
    structures, abilities, and configurations for Mage class characters within the
    TrinityCore framework. This includes defining default spell rotations, mana management
    strategies, and combat behavior patterns that are unique to the Mage class. The
    method ensures that Mage-specific roles such as burst damage dealer, sustained
    damage dealer, or support caster are properly configured with appropriate skill
    sets and resource allocation mechanisms. It typically runs during server initialization
    or character creation to establish baseline role behaviors before gameplay begins.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializeMageRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when a new
    Mage character is created. It modifies internal state variables and should not
    be invoked repeatedly in rapid succession. The initialization process may involve
    loading configuration files from disk, setting up default ability priorities,
    and registering Mage-specific AI behaviors with the core game engine.
  warnings: Calling this method after initial game setup may result in inconsistent
    role behavior or corrupted character state. Do not invoke this method during active
    gameplay sessions as it could disrupt ongoing combat mechanics or spell casting
    sequences.
