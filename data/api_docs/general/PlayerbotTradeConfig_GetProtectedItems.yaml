  signature: const std::vector<uint32> & PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetProtectedItems()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the vector of item IDs that are protected
    from trading in player bot configurations.
  description: The GetProtectedItems method retrieves a constant reference to a vector
    containing the global unique identifiers (GUIDs) of items that are marked as protected
    within the PlayerbotTradeConfig. These protected items cannot be traded by player
    bots under any circumstances, ensuring that valuable or restricted items remain
    in the bot's inventory. This method is typically used during trade processing
    to check whether an item being considered for trading is in the protected list.
    The returned vector is read-only and should not be modified directly. The configuration
    of protected items is usually loaded from the database or configuration files
    at initialization time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::vector<uint32> containing item GUIDs that
    are marked as protected from trading in player bot configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is protected before offering it for trade
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nconst std::vector<uint32>& protectedItems = playerbot->GetTradeConfig().GetProtectedItems();\n\
      if (std::find(protectedItems.begin(), protectedItems.end(), itemId) != protectedItems.end())\
      \ {\n    // Item is protected, do not trade it\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbots\"\
      , \"Item {} is protected and will not be traded.\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to an internal vector. Modifying
    the returned vector directly will not affect the configuration, as it's a copy
    of the reference. The list of protected items is typically initialized once during
    the configuration loading phase and does not change during runtime unless explicitly
    updated through other methods.
