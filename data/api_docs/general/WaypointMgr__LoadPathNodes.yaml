documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all waypoint path nodes from the database into memory
    for creature movement.
  description: The _LoadPathNodes method is responsible for retrieving all stored
    waypoint path data from the database and loading it into memory for use by the
    WaypointMgr. This method is typically called during server startup or when waypoints
    need to be reloaded. It processes the path node data, constructs internal waypoint
    structures, and prepares them for creature movement routines. The method ensures
    that all creatures with assigned waypoints can properly navigate their predefined
    paths. This is a private helper method used internally by the WaypointMgr class
    and should not be called directly by other systems.

  - title: Server Startup Loading
    code: "void WorldLoader::LoadWaypoints()\n{\n    sWaypointMgr->_LoadPathNodes();\n\
      \    // Waypoints are now loaded and ready for creature movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries to fetch all path node data, which
    can be performance-intensive on servers with many waypoints. It's typically invoked
    during server initialization or when the waypoint system needs to refresh its
    data cache. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the relevant tables (like `waypoint_data`) contain valid data.
