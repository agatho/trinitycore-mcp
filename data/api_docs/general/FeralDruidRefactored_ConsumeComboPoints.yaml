  class: FeralDruidRefactored
  method: ConsumeComboPoints
  signature: void FeralDruidRefactored::ConsumeComboPoints(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified number of combo points from the Feral Druid's current
    combo point stack.
  description: The ConsumeComboPoints method reduces the active combo point count
    of a Feral Druid character by the provided amount. This method is typically invoked
    when performing abilities that require or consume combo points, such as Shred,
    Rip, or Ferocious Bite. The method ensures that the combo point count does not
    drop below zero and may trigger related game mechanics such as resetting the combo
    point timer or updating the player's UI. It is an essential part of managing combo
    point resources in Feral Druid gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combo Point Consumption
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.ConsumeComboPoints(1); // Consumes one combo point'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Combo Points
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.ConsumeComboPoints(5); // Consumes all 5 combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Druid has sufficient combo points
    to consume. The implementation likely interacts with internal combo point tracking
    and may update related game state variables such as the last time combo points
    were spent or whether a combo point-consuming ability is currently active.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the Druid has enough combo
    points may result in negative combo point values, which could lead to undefined
    behavior or visual glitches in the UI. Always ensure combo point availability
    before consumption.
