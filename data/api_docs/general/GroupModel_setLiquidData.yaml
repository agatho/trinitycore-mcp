  class: GroupModel
  method: setLiquidData
  signature: void GroupModel::setLiquidData(WmoLiquid * liquid)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns liquid data to the group model for terrain rendering.
  description: The setLiquidData method is used to associate a WmoLiquid object with
    the GroupModel, which contains information about liquid properties such as type,
    height, and texture. This assignment is crucial for proper terrain rendering in
    World of Warcraft's client, particularly for water bodies and other liquid surfaces
    within WMO (World Map Object) groups. The method typically gets called during
    the loading and initialization phase of WMO data processing, where liquid information
    from the .wmo file is parsed and assigned to corresponding group models. This
    ensures that when the game renders the terrain, it correctly displays liquid surfaces
    with appropriate visual properties.
  parameters:
  - name: liquid
    description: Pointer to a WmoLiquid object containing liquid data for the group
      model. This parameter can be null if no liquid data is available for this particular
      group.
  returns: No return value. This method performs an assignment operation and does
    not return any data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WmoLiquid* liquidData = new WmoLiquid();

      // ... populate liquidData with appropriate values ...

      groupModel->setLiquidData(liquidData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Null Check Usage
    code: "WmoLiquid* liquidData = getLiquidDataForGroup(groupId);\nif (liquidData\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    groupModel->setLiquidData(liquidData);\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   groupModel->setLiquidData(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the WMO loading system. Developers
    should not need to call this directly unless implementing custom WMO processing
    logic. The GroupModel class maintains ownership of the liquid data pointer, so
    care must be taken when managing memory and object lifetimes.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method is valid and will clear any existing
    liquid data from the group model. However, calling this method with an invalid
    or improperly initialized WmoLiquid pointer may cause rendering artifacts or crashes
    during terrain display.
