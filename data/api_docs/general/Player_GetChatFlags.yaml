  class: Player
  method: GetChatFlags
  signature: uint16 Player::GetChatFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the chat flags of the player, indicating chat message types and permissions.
  description: The GetChatFlags method retrieves the current chat flags set for a
    player, which determines the types of chat messages they can send and receive.
    These flags are used to control chat behavior in World of Warcraft, including
    determining whether a player can send or receive whispers, guild chat, officer
    chat, and other message types. The method returns a uint16 value representing
    the bitmask of active chat flags, allowing developers to understand and modify
    player chat permissions within the game mechanics framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the current chat flags for the player.
    This value is a bitmask that indicates which chat message types are enabled or
    disabled, with each bit corresponding to different chat channels (e.g., whisper,
    guild, officer). The return value may be zero if no chat flags are set, or a combination
    of flag values depending on the player's current chat permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint16 chatFlags = player->GetChatFlags();\nif (chatFlags & CHAT_FLAG_SAY)\n\
      {\n    // Player can send say messages\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other chat-related methods
    to fully control player chat behavior. The chat flags returned by this method
    are usually set during player initialization or when chat permissions change,
    and may be modified through various game mechanics such as GM commands or player
    interaction.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying chat flags, as incorrect use can lead
    to players being unable to send or receive messages properly. The chat flag values
    are typically defined by constants in the TrinityCore codebase, so developers
    should ensure they understand the meaning of each bit before modifying them.
