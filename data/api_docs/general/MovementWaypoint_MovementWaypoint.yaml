  class: MovementWaypoint
  method: MovementWaypoint
  signature: void MovementWaypoint::MovementWaypoint(const int & pos, float wait,
    bool required, const std::string & desc)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a movement waypoint with position, wait time, requirement flag,
    and description.
  description: The MovementWaypoint constructor initializes a waypoint object used
    in AI pathfinding for creatures or NPCs. It sets up essential properties including
    the waypoint's position (as an integer index), the duration to wait at that point,
    whether the waypoint is required for successful path completion, and a descriptive
    string for debugging or logging purposes. This method is typically invoked when
    building movement paths for scripted behaviors in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    engine.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index of this waypoint in the movement sequence. Used
      to determine order and reference during path execution.
  - name: wait
    description: The amount of time (in seconds) the creature should pause at this
      waypoint before proceeding to the next one.
  - name: required
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether this waypoint is mandatory for
      path completion. If true, failure to reach this point may cause path cancellation.
  - name: desc
    description: A descriptive string that can be used for logging or debugging purposes
      to identify the purpose or location of this waypoint.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Initialization
    code: MovementWaypoint wp(0, 2.5f, true, "Start Position");
    language: cpp
  - title: Optional Waypoint with Long Wait
    code: MovementWaypoint wp(3, 10.0f, false, "Rest Point");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MovementWaypoint class which is commonly used
    within AI scripts for creature movement. The 'pos' parameter should be unique
    per waypoint in a given path to maintain proper sequence order.
  warnings: Ensure that waypoints are added in logical order based on the intended
    movement path. Incorrect positioning or wait times may result in unexpected NPC
    behavior or stuck units.
