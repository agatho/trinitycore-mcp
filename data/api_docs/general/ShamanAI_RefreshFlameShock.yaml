  class: ShamanAI
  method: RefreshFlameShock
  signature: void ShamanAI::RefreshFlameShock(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Refreshes the Flame Shock debuff on the target if it is not already active
    or has insufficient duration.
  description: The RefreshFlameShock method in the ShamanAI class is responsible for
    maintaining the Flame Shock spell's duration on a target by reapplying it when
    necessary. This method checks whether the target currently has the Flame Shock
    debuff and evaluates its remaining duration. If the debuff is missing or has less
    than a specified threshold of time remaining, the method will trigger the application
    of Flame Shock again. This behavior is crucial for maintaining optimal damage
    output in elemental shaman gameplay, as Flame Shock provides a significant portion
    of the class's damage through its periodic damage ticks and interaction with other
    abilities like Lava Burst. The method operates within the context of the AI's
    decision-making process and is typically invoked during combat to ensure that
    key debuffs are maintained.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID)
      on which Flame Shock should be refreshed. The value must be a valid target GUID,
      otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shaman AI Context
    code: "void MyShamanAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_target)\n    {\n        int targetGuid\
      \ = m_target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        RefreshFlameShock(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void ElementalShamanAI::DoCombat()\n{\n    if (m_target && m_target->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        int targetGuid = m_target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n      \
      \  // Check if Flame Shock needs refreshing\n        if (!m_creature->HasAura(SPELL_FLAME_SHOCK_AURA,\
      \ targetGuid))\n        {\n            RefreshFlameShock(&targetGuid);\n   \
      \     }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to valid combat targets and that
    the necessary spell data is available. The internal logic may vary based on the
    specific implementation of the shaman AI, including how it determines when to
    refresh the debuff (e.g., based on time remaining or damage tick intervals). It's
    recommended to ensure that the target remains valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null target GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target is alive and within range before invoking
    RefreshFlameShock. Additionally, excessive calls without checking for existing
    debuff status can result in unnecessary spell usage and potential performance
    degradation.
