  signature: void Guild::HandleGetAchievementMembers(WorldSession * session, uint32
    achievementId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and processes guild members who have earned a specific achievement.
  description: The HandleGetAchievementMembers method is responsible for identifying
    all guild members who have earned a specified achievement. It takes an achievement
    ID as input and queries the database or internal structures to find matching members.
    This functionality is typically used in response to client requests for achievement-related
    data, such as displaying which players in the guild have achieved a particular
    milestone. The method likely handles permission checks to ensure that only authorized
    sessions can access this information, and it may involve sending back structured
    data to the requesting client session.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      making the request. Used to send responses back to the player.
  - name: achievementId
    description: Unique identifier for the achievement being queried. Must correspond
      to a valid achievement in the game database.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->HandleGetAchievementMembers(session,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to fetch member data and achievement
    records. It may involve caching mechanisms for performance optimization when handling
    frequent requests. The method assumes that the guild object is valid and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that session is not null before calling this method, as passing
    a null session could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also, verify that
    the achievementId corresponds to an existing achievement in the database to avoid
    invalid queries.
