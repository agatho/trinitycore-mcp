    factionId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the paragon reputation entry for a specified faction ID.
  description: The GetParagonReputation method fetches the ParagonReputationEntry
    associated with a given faction ID from the DB2 database. This entry typically
    contains data related to paragon reputation thresholds, rewards, and progression
    mechanics for factions in World of Warcraft. The method performs a lookup within
    the internal DB2 manager's cached data structures to efficiently retrieve the
    requested entry. It is commonly used during player reputation updates or when
    checking faction-specific paragon rewards and progression states. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the DB2Manager instance remains alive and the
    data has not been reloaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a ParagonReputationEntry object if a matching faction
    ID is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no entry exists for the specified faction
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const ParagonReputationEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetParagonReputation(1234);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    // Use entry->ReputationThreshold, entry->RewardItemID, etc.\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Paragon Status
    code: "uint32 factionId = player->GetFaction();\nconst ParagonReputationEntry*\
      \ paragonEntry = sDB2Manager->GetParagonReputation(factionId);\nif (paragonEntry\
      \ && player->GetReputation(factionId) >= paragonEntry->ReputationThreshold)\n\
      {\n    // Player has reached paragon reputation for this faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 caching and assumes that the ParagonReputation.db2
    file is properly loaded. The returned entry should not be modified directly as
    it represents static data from the game's database files.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the faction has paragon
    rewards enabled; always validate the entry's fields for meaningful values before
    using them in gameplay logic.
