documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes world safe locations from the database into memory
    for use in player teleportation and respawn mechanics.
  description: The LoadWorldSafeLocs method retrieves all defined world safe locations
    from the database and populates internal data structures used by the TrinityCore
    server. These locations are critical for player respawns, teleportation, and maintaining
    valid spawn points across different zones. The method is typically invoked during
    server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all known safe locations
    are available for use. It processes entries from the 'worgrounds' table (or similar)
    and caches them in memory for fast lookup during gameplay. This ensures that players
    can be safely teleported to valid locations without risking crashes or invalid
    positions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadWorldSafeLocs()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadWorldSafeLocs();\n\
      }\n\n// Called during server startup in World.cpp\nint main()\n{\n    // ...\
      \ initialization code ...\n    sWorld->LoadWorldSafeLocs();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with startup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called once during server initialization and may be
    re-invoked when reloading database content. The loaded safe locations are cached
    in memory for performance reasons, so changes to the database require a server
    restart or explicit reload to take effect.
