  class: SocialManager
  method: ProcessChatQueue
  signature: void SocialManager::ProcessChatQueue(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes queued chat messages in the social manager.
  description: The ProcessChatQueue method handles the processing of chat messages
    that have been queued for delivery within the SocialManager. This method is typically
    called during the game loop to ensure that chat messages are properly handled
    and dispatched to their intended recipients. It manages the timing and execution
    of queued communications, ensuring proper synchronization and message flow between
    players in the game world. The method takes a time delta parameter to determine
    how much time has passed since the last execution, which helps in managing message
    timing and rate limiting.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) since the last call to this
      method. This value is used to determine how many queued messages can be processed
      based on rate limiting and timing constraints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      \    sSocialMgr->ProcessChatQueue(diff);\n    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player communication system
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Handle player-specific updates\n\
      \    sSocialMgr->ProcessChatQueue(diff);\n    // Continue with other player\
      \ updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should not be
    called directly by other systems unless specifically required. The implementation
    may include rate limiting to prevent spamming of chat messages. It's important
    to note that this method operates on queued messages only, not real-time messages.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended game update cycle as it
    may cause synchronization issues or unexpected behavior. Improper handling of
    the diff parameter can lead to incorrect message processing timing.
