  notes: This method is part of the player's customization system and relies on internal
    data structures. It should be used carefully as it may not always reflect the
    latest state if customization changes are pending or if the player hasn't fully
    loaded yet.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if no customization choice has been set for the
    specified option ID, which could lead to misinterpretation of the player's customization
    choices. Always verify that the returned value is valid before acting on it.
