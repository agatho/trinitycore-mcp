  brief: Updates the progress of all active quests for the player
  description: The UpdateQuestProgress method iterates through all currently active
    quests assigned to a player and updates their progress based on current in-game
    conditions. This includes checking for quest objectives such as killing monsters,
    collecting items, or visiting specific locations. The method typically gets called
    during game loop updates or when quest-related events occur. It ensures that quest
    data remains synchronized with the player's current state and advances quest completion
    where applicable.

    code: "void GameWorld::UpdatePlayerQuests(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player &&\
      \ player->GetQuestManager())\n    {\n        player->GetQuestManager()->UpdateQuestProgress();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active players with valid quest data.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the core game loop but can also be manually
    triggered during specific quest events or state changes.
