documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a quest is cached in the QuestCache.
  description: The IsQuestCached method determines if a specific quest ID exists within
    the internal cache of the QuestCache class. This functionality is typically used
    to avoid redundant database queries for quest data that has already been loaded
    and processed. The method performs a fast lookup operation on the cached quests,
    returning true if the quest is present in the cache, or false if it is not. This
    caching mechanism improves performance by reducing repeated access to the database
    for frequently requested quest information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest ID is found in the QuestCache; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (questCache.IsQuestCached(12345)) {\n    // Quest is cached, proceed\
      \ with cached data\n    printf(\"Quest 12345 is cached\\n\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Quest is not cached, need to load from database\n    printf(\"Quest 12345\
      \ is not cached\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestCache class likely uses an internal data structure such as a hash
    map or set for fast lookup. This method should be used before attempting to load
    quest data from the database to optimize performance.
