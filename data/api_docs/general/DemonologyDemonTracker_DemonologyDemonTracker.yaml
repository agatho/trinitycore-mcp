  class: DemonologyDemonTracker
  method: DemonologyDemonTracker
  signature: void DemonologyDemonTracker::DemonologyDemonTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the DemonologyDemonTracker class for managing
    demon-related tracking in the Demonology warlock specialization.
  description: The DemonologyDemonTracker constructor initializes all internal state
    variables and data structures required for tracking demon-related mechanics specific
    to the Demonology warlock specialization. This includes setting up tracking for
    summoned demons, their durations, and associated effects. The method prepares
    the tracker to monitor and manage the lifecycle of demons summoned through Demonology
    abilities such as Summon Imp, Felguard, or other demon summons. It ensures that
    all necessary resources are allocated and default values are set for proper operation
    within the TrinityCore framework's combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new DemonologyDemonTracker instance
    code: 'DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker = new DemonologyDemonTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track demon mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the warlock's spell system
    when a Demonology specialization is active. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless implementing custom demon tracking logic. The class likely maintains
    internal references to player data and combat state that are initialized during
    construction.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of this class outside of TrinityCore's internal systems
    may lead to undefined behavior if required player or world state references are
    not properly set up. This is a specialized class for warlock demon management
    and should be used with caution in custom modules.
