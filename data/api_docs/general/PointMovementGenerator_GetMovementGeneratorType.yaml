documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for point-based movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the PointMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore's AI and movement system to distinguish different types of movement
    generators. The returned value typically corresponds to predefined constants in
    the MovementGeneratorType enum, allowing the game engine to properly handle and
    dispatch movement-related logic for objects using this specific movement generator.
    This method is commonly called during movement processing, AI decision making,
    or when querying the type of movement behavior currently assigned to a creature
    or player.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for PointMovementGenerator.
    This value corresponds to the MGTYPE_POINT constant in TrinityCore's movement
    system, typically returning 10 or a similar predefined value depending on the
    engine version.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "PointMovementGenerator* pointGen = new PointMovementGenerator(0, 10.0f,\
      \ 20.0f, 30.0f);\nint type = pointGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type\
      \ == MGTYPE_POINT)\n{\n    // Handle point movement specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Movement Type Validation
    code: "void ValidateMovement(MovementGenerator* gen)\n{\n    if (gen->GetMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == MGTYPE_POINT)\n    {\n        // Process point movement specific data\n\
      \        PointMovementGenerator* pointGen = static_cast<PointMovementGenerator*>(gen);\n\
      \        // Perform operations specific to point movement\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function implementation in the base MovementGenerator
    class, and should always return a consistent value for PointMovementGenerator
    instances. The returned integer value is used extensively throughout TrinityCore's
    movement system for type checking, serialization, and AI behavior selection.
  warnings: Do not rely on the exact numeric value returned by this method as it may
    change between TrinityCore versions. Always use predefined constants like MGTYPE_POINT
    instead of hardcoded values when comparing return values.
