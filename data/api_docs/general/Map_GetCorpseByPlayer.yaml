  class: Map
  method: GetCorpseByPlayer
  signature: int * Map::GetCorpseByPlayer(const int & ownerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the corpse GUID associated with a player's GUID.
  description: This method retrieves the corpse GUID that is associated with a specific
    player's GUID. It is used to find the corpse of a player who has died, typically
    in the context of World of Warcraft's game mechanics where players can respawn
    at their corpse location. The method operates on a map level and is essential
    for handling player death and resurrection scenarios within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: ownerGuid
    description: The GUID of the player whose corpse is being searched for. This is
      typically a player's GUID (not a creature or object GUID) and represents the
      unique identifier of the player who died.
  returns: Returns the GUID of the corpse associated with the given player's GUID,
    or 0 if no such corpse exists. The returned value represents the unique identifier
    of the player's corpse, which is used to locate where the player died and can
    be used for resurrection mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Finding a player's corpse
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\nint corpseGuid = map->GetCorpseByPlayer(playerGuid);\n\
      if (corpseGuid != 0)\n{\n    // Player has a corpse\n    // Use corpseGuid to\
      \ locate the corpse\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No corpse found for player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that handle
    player death and resurrection. It may be called from various game mechanics contexts,
    including when a player dies or when trying to find a player's corpse after death.
    Performance considerations include the need for efficient GUID lookups within
    the map.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context of player
    death or resurrection. Using it outside of appropriate game mechanics can lead
    to incorrect behavior or errors in handling player corpse locations.
