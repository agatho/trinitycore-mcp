documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of a group's instance route traversal.
  description: The UpdateRouteProgress method is responsible for advancing or updating
    the current stage of a group's journey through an instance. This typically involves
    tracking which objectives have been completed, updating quest states, and managing
    the progression of group members through various stages of the instance content.
    The method ensures that all players in the group are synchronized with the current
    route status and handles any necessary state transitions or notifications for
    progress updates.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose route progress
      is being updated. Must not be null and should represent a valid group in the
      instance.

  notes: This method is typically called during instance progression events such as
    completing objectives or reaching specific waypoints. It may trigger internal
    state updates that affect player experience and quest completion tracking.
