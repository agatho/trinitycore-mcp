  class: InsanityTracker
  method: SpendInsanity
  signature: void InsanityTracker::SpendInsanity(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the current insanity amount by the specified value.
  description: The SpendInsanity method decreases the tracked insanity value of a
    player or creature by the provided amount. This method is typically used in game
    mechanics where players or NPCs consume insanity resources, such as during spell
    casting or ability usage. The method does not allow the insanity value to go below
    zero, ensuring minimum bounds are maintained. It's commonly associated with class-specific
    abilities in classes like Shadow Priest or other insanity-based gameplay systems
    within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of insanity to deduct from the current tracker value.
      Must be a non-negative integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Insanity Reduction
    code: 'InsanityTracker* tracker = player->GetInsanityTracker();

      tracker->SpendInsanity(50); // Deducts 50 insanity from the tracker'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Insanity Spending
    code: "InsanityTracker* tracker = player->GetInsanityTracker();\nif (tracker->GetCurrentInsanity()\
      \ >= 100)\n{\n    tracker->SpendInsanity(100);\n    // Perform action requiring\
      \ 100 insanity\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game state tracking and may trigger
    events or updates when the insanity value changes. It should be called only when
    the entity has sufficient insanity to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available insanity can lead to incorrect
    resource management. Ensure that the amount being spent does not exceed current
    insanity levels unless handled by the implementation.
