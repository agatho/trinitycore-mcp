  class: LootAnalysis
  method: EnableLearning
  signature: void LootAnalysis::EnableLearning(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the loot learning feature for the LootAnalysis system.
  description: The EnableLearning method controls whether the LootAnalysis system
    should actively learn from loot data. When enabled, the system will process and
    store information about items dropped, their sources, and player interactions
    to improve future loot recommendations or analysis. When disabled, no new learning
    occurs but previously learned data may still be used for analysis. This method
    is typically used to toggle learning behavior during gameplay or testing scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines the learning state. If true, enables
      learning; if false, disables learning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable loot learning
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analysis = new LootAnalysis();

      analysis->EnableLearning(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable loot learning during testing
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analysis = sWorld->GetLootAnalysis();

      analysis->EnableLearning(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not affect existing learned data; it only controls future
    data collection. The system may still perform analysis on previously collected
    data even when learning is disabled.
  warnings: Disabling learning during active gameplay may prevent the system from
    adapting to new loot patterns or player behavior, potentially reducing the accuracy
    of future recommendations.
