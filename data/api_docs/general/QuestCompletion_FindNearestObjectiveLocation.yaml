api:
  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindNearestObjectiveLocation
  signature: int QuestCompletion::FindNearestObjectiveLocation(Player * bot, const
    QuestObjectiveData & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the index of the nearest objective location for a given
    quest objective data.
  description: The FindNearestObjectiveLocation method determines the closest objective
    location from a list of possible locations associated with a specific quest objective.
    It takes a player reference and quest objective data as input, evaluates the proximity
    of each potential objective location to the player's current position, and returns
    the index of the nearest one. This functionality is commonly used in automated
    quest completion logic where bots or AI need to determine the next logical step
    in completing a quest. The method assumes that the objective data contains valid
    location information and that the player object is properly initialized with current
    world coordinates.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the nearest objective location is being calculated. Must be a valid, initialized
      player instance.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to QuestObjectiveData containing the quest objective information
      including possible location coordinates. The data should include at least one
      valid location point for comparison.
  returns: Integer representing the index of the nearest objective location in the
    list of locations associated with the given quest objective. Returns -1 if no
    valid locations are found or if an error occurs during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Initialized player object\nQuestObjectiveData\
      \ objData = ...; // Filled with objective data\nint nearestIndex = QuestCompletion::FindNearestObjectiveLocation(player,\
      \ objData);\nif (nearestIndex >= 0) {\n    // Process the nearest objective\
      \ location at index 'nearestIndex'\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData objective;\n// Assume objective\
      \ is populated with valid data\nint result = QuestCompletion::FindNearestObjectiveLocation(bot,\
      \ objective);\nif (result == -1) {\n    // Handle case where no objective locations\
      \ were found\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to find nearest objective location\
      \ for quest.\");\n} else {\n    // Use result as index to access the actual\
      \ location data\n    Location& nearestLoc = objective.locations[result];\n \
      \   // Proceed with navigation or interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate player positioning and valid objective location
    data. Performance may be affected when dealing with large numbers of objective
    locations, as it performs a linear search to determine the closest point. The
    implementation assumes that all coordinates are in the same world space and uses
    Euclidean distance for comparison.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Player object and QuestObjectiveData contain valid,
    non-null data before calling this method. Passing invalid or uninitialized objects
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method does not validate whether
    the player is within a reasonable distance of any objective locations.
