  signature: void DynamicObject::RemoveAura()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras from the dynamic object.
  description: The RemoveAura method removes all active auras from the dynamic object,
    effectively clearing any ongoing effects or buffs/debuffs that were applied to
    it. This method is typically called when the dynamic object's duration expires
    or when it is explicitly removed from the game world. It ensures that all aura-related
    data structures are properly cleaned up and that any callbacks or handlers associated
    with those auras are notified of their removal. The operation is performed synchronously
    and affects all auras currently applied to this dynamic object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      dynObj->RemoveAura();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on dynamic objects that are still valid
    and in the game world. Calling it on a destroyed or invalid object may lead to
    undefined behavior. The method internally iterates through all active auras and
    removes them from the object's aura list, which may trigger cleanup routines for
    each aura.
