documentation:
  brief: Disconnects all bot sessions managed by the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance.
  description: The DisconnectAllBots method terminates all active bot sessions within
    the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized manager. This function is typically used during
    server shutdown, configuration changes, or when resetting the bot system to ensure
    that all connected bots are properly disconnected and cleaned up. The method iterates
    through all registered bot sessions and invokes the appropriate disconnection
    logic for each session, ensuring that resources associated with the bots are freed
    and their state is properly reset. This operation is essential for maintaining
    server stability and preventing resource leaks when bot systems need to be deactivated
    or reconfigured.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionManager = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::instance();

      sessionManager->DisconnectAllBots();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will immediately terminate all
    bot connections without graceful shutdown procedures. It is recommended to use
    this method only during controlled server maintenance or shutdown scenarios. The
    implementation likely involves locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when
    managing concurrent bot sessions.
  warnings: Calling DisconnectAllBots while bots are actively engaged in gameplay
    or quests may result in unexpected behavior or data loss. Ensure all active bot
    operations are properly saved or suspended before invoking this method.
