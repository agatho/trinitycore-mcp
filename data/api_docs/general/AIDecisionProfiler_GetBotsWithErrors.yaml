    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot GUIDs that have encountered errors during AI decision
    processing.
  description: The GetBotsWithErrors method returns a vector containing the unique
    identifiers (GUIDs) of all bots that have experienced errors while executing AI
    decisions. This method is typically used for debugging and monitoring purposes
    to identify problematic bots in an AI-driven system. The returned list may be
    limited to a specified count if the 'count' parameter is provided, though this
    method signature does not include such a parameter. The implementation likely
    tracks error states within the AIDecisionProfiler class, which monitors bot behavior
    and logs any anomalies or failures during decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the GUIDs of bots that have encountered
    errors during AI decision processing. Each element in the vector represents a
    unique bot identifier. The vector may be empty if no bots have reported errors
    since the profiler was initialized or last reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\nstd::vector<uint32_t> errorBots = profiler.GetBotsWithErrors();\n\
      for (uint32_t botGuid : errorBots)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Bot with GUID \" <<\
      \ botGuid << \" has errors.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other profiling methods to
    provide comprehensive AI behavior analysis. The returned vector should be treated
    as read-only and may not reflect real-time changes unless the profiler is actively
    monitoring bots. Performance impact is minimal since it only returns stored error
    data.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the returned bot GUIDs are still
    active or valid in the current game session. It's recommended to verify bot status
    before attempting any operations on the returned identifiers.
