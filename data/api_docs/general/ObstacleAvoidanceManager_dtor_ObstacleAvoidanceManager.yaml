documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ObstacleAvoidanceManager instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the ObstacleAvoidanceManager class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources used by the manager.
    This includes releasing any internal data structures, clearing lists of obstacles,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager object goes out of scope.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this manager likely handles
    pathfinding avoidance logic for units moving through environments with static
    or dynamic obstacles such as buildings, terrain features, or other entities. The
    destructor ensures that when a unit's AI behavior ends or the manager is explicitly
    deleted, all internal state is properly cleaned up to prevent resource leaks and
    maintain system stability.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ObstacleAvoidanceManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ObstacleAvoidanceManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here when going\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of ObstacleAvoidanceManager pointer
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = new ObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers the destructor

      manager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called directly unless you're managing memory manually. The implementation
    likely includes cleanup of internal containers and may perform additional housekeeping
    tasks such as removing references from global managers or notifying other systems
    about the destruction event.
  warnings: Developers should avoid calling this destructor manually unless they are
    explicitly managing memory through raw pointers. Calling it multiple times on
    the same object will result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure that all references
    to the manager are cleared before deletion to prevent dangling pointer issues.
