  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: UpdateNPCCache
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::UpdateNPCCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal cache of NPC interactions and their current states.
  description: The UpdateNPCCache method refreshes the internal data structures that
    store information about NPCs available for interaction within the game world.
    This includes updating quest states, gossip options, and other dynamic interaction
    data for all NPCs currently present in the player's vicinity or tracked by the
    system. The method ensures that cached NPC data remains synchronized with the
    actual game state, preventing stale or outdated interaction possibilities from
    being presented to players. It is typically invoked during periodic updates or
    when significant changes occur in the NPC's environment or quest status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->UpdateNPCCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate NPC interaction
    data. It may involve database queries or complex state calculations, so frequent
    invocation could impact performance. The cache update process is typically non-blocking
    but may cause temporary delays during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can lead to performance degradation
    due to repeated data synchronization operations. Avoid calling it in tight loops
    or high-frequency event handlers without proper throttling mechanisms.
