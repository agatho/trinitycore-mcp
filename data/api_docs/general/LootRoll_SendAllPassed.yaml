  method: SendAllPassed
  signature: void LootRoll::SendAllPassed()
documentation:
  brief: Sends a passed message to all players involved in the loot roll.
  description: The SendAllPassed method is used in TrinityCore's loot system to notify
    all players who participated in a loot roll that the roll has concluded with no
    successful rolls. This typically occurs when all players pass on an item, or when
    the item is rolled for but no one meets the requirements (such as having the required
    skill or being in the correct group). The method broadcasts a specific packet
    to all players in the loot group, indicating that the loot has passed and no one
    has won it. This ensures that all participants are informed of the outcome without
    requiring manual checking.

  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "void ProcessLootRoll(LootRoll* roll)\n{\n    // ... some logic to determine\
      \ no one won the roll\n    roll->SendAllPassed();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot system when a roll
    concludes without any successful outcomes. It's important to note that this method
    does not actually perform any rolling logic itself, but rather sends the appropriate
    network message to clients.
