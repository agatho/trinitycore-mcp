  class: InstanceScriptDataWriter
  method: InstanceScriptDataWriter
  signature: void InstanceScriptDataWriter::InstanceScriptDataWriter(InstanceScript
    & instance)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an InstanceScriptDataWriter object with a reference to an InstanceScript
    instance for data serialization.
  description: The InstanceScriptDataWriter constructor initializes a data writer
    object that is bound to a specific InstanceScript instance. This allows the writer
    to serialize and store instance-related data, such as boss encounter states, event
    progress, and other persistent world state information. The writer typically works
    in conjunction with TrinityCore's instance management system to ensure that instance
    data is properly saved and restored when players enter or leave instances. This
    constructor sets up internal state tracking and prepares the object for subsequent
    data writing operations.
  parameters:
  - name: instance
    description: A reference to the InstanceScript object that this writer will manage.
      This parameter specifies which instance's data should be written and tracked
      by this writer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic InstanceScriptDataWriter Initialization
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map)\n    {\n        // Initialize the data writer with\
      \ this instance\n        dataWriter = new InstanceScriptDataWriter(*this);\n\
      \    }\n    \nprivate:\n    InstanceScriptDataWriter* dataWriter;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The InstanceScriptDataWriter is typically used internally by TrinityCore's
    instance management system. Developers should not directly instantiate this class
    unless implementing custom instance data handling logic. The writer maintains
    internal references to the instance's data structures and should be properly managed
    to avoid memory leaks.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor directly in custom scripts without understanding
    the underlying instance management system. Improper usage may lead to data corruption
    or memory issues. Ensure that the InstanceScript reference passed is valid and
    remains alive for the duration of the writer's use.
