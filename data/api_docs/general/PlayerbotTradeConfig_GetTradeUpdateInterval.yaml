  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: GetTradeUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeUpdateInterval()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the interval in milliseconds at which trade updates occur for player
    bots.
  description: The GetTradeUpdateInterval method retrieves the configured time interval,
    measured in milliseconds, that determines how frequently player bot trade data
    is updated within the TrinityCore AI system. This value controls the frequency
    of trade-related checks and updates during bot behavior execution. The returned
    value is typically derived from configuration settings or defaults defined in
    the playerbot system. This interval directly impacts the responsiveness and resource
    usage of trade-related AI behaviors, as more frequent updates provide better accuracy
    but consume additional CPU cycles.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the trade update interval in milliseconds.
    Typical values range from 1000 (1 second) to 30000 (30 seconds), depending on
    configuration settings and desired responsiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 interval = bot->GetTradeUpdateInterval();

      LOG_DEBUG("playerbot", "Trade update interval: {} ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interval for Timing Logic
    code: "uint32 interval = playerbot->GetTradeUpdateInterval();\nif (getMSTime()\
      \ - lastTradeUpdate > interval)\n{\n    // Perform trade update logic\n    lastTradeUpdate\
      \ = getMSTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization and configuration
    loading. The value returned may be cached or dynamically calculated based on server
    settings. Changes to the underlying configuration will not affect previously cached
    return values unless the bot is reinitialized.
