  class: RogueAI
  method: ExecuteFallbackRotation
  signature: void RogueAI::ExecuteFallbackRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the fallback combat rotation for a rogue AI, determining actions
    when no primary rotation is active.
  description: The ExecuteFallbackRotation method implements the default behavior
    for a RogueAI when no specific combat rotation or priority is defined. It evaluates
    the current combat state and selects appropriate actions such as applying poisons,
    using stealth abilities, or performing basic attacks. This method serves as a
    safety net to ensure that the rogue AI remains functional even under suboptimal
    conditions. The method typically operates on the target specified by the input
    parameter, which may be updated during execution based on combat dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      current target. This value is used to determine which enemy the rogue should
      act against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    int target = GetTargetIndex();\n    ExecuteFallbackRotation(&target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Switching Logic
    code: "void RogueAI::OnTargetChange()\n{\n    int target = GetCurrentTarget();\n\
      \    if (target != -1)\n        ExecuteFallbackRotation(&target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to a valid target through the
    provided pointer. It is recommended to validate the target before calling this
    function to prevent undefined behavior. The fallback rotation may include stealth
    checks, poison application, and basic melee attacks depending on the rogue's current
    state.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteFallbackRotation without ensuring a valid target can lead
    to incorrect AI behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target parameter points to
    a valid entity before invoking this method.
