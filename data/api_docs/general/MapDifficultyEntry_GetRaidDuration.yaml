  class: MapDifficultyEntry
  method: GetRaidDuration
  signature: uint32 MapDifficultyEntry::GetRaidDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the raid duration in seconds for the map difficulty.
  description: The GetRaidDuration method retrieves the maximum time allowed for a
    raid instance on the specified map difficulty. This value determines how long
    players have to complete the raid before it automatically ends. The returned duration
    is typically used by the game's instance management system to enforce time limits
    on raid encounters and determine when to close the instance. This method is commonly
    called when initializing raid instances or checking remaining time for players
    in active raids.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the raid duration in seconds. This value indicates
    how long the raid instance will remain active before automatically closing, typically
    ranging from several minutes to hours depending on the difficulty level and map
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MapDifficultyEntry const* difficulty = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(123);

      uint32 raidDuration = difficulty->GetRaidDuration();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Raid duration: %u seconds", raidDuration);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Raid Time Remaining
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->IsRaid()) {\n    MapDifficultyEntry const* difficulty\
      \ = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMap()->GetDifficultyID());\n\
      \    uint32 duration = difficulty->GetRaidDuration();\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"misc\"\
      , \"Raid has %u seconds remaining\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal map difficulty data stored in the game's database
    and should only be called on valid MapDifficultyEntry instances. The returned
    value is typically configured per difficulty level (normal, heroic, mythic) and
    map type (dungeons, raids). Performance impact is minimal as it simply returns
    a cached value.
  warnings: Ensure that the MapDifficultyEntry pointer is valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. This method should not be called on null or
    invalid entries, as it may cause crashes in release builds.
