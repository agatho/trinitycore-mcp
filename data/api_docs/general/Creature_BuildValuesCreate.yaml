  signature: void Creature::BuildValuesCreate(int * data, int flags, const Player
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Builds the creature's update fields for the target player
  description: This method constructs the update data for a creature object, including
    its visual representation and properties, to be sent to a specific player. It
    handles the creation of update fields that reflect the creature's state in the
    game world, ensuring proper synchronization between the server and client. The
    method is typically used during creature spawn events or when updating player-specific
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing the update fields for
      the creature
  - name: flags
    description: Integer value indicating the type of update flags being applied,
      such as visibility or movement flags
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the player object for whom the update data is being constructed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: Creature::BuildValuesCreate(&data[0], flags, target);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'int updateData[MAX_UPDATE_FIELDS];

      int flags = 0;

      Player* targetPlayer = player;

      Creature::BuildValuesCreate(updateData, flags, targetPlayer);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called only when the creature is being created or updated
    for a specific player. It involves setting up update fields based on creature's
    current state and properties, including visual representation such as display
    ID, faction, and other attributes.
  warnings: Care must be taken when handling update data to ensure that all fields
    are properly initialized before calling this method. Incorrect implementation
    may lead to client-side visual glitches or synchronization issues.
