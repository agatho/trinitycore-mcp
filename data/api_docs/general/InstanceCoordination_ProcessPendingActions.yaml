  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: ProcessPendingActions
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ProcessPendingActions(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending actions for a specified group within the instance coordination
    system.
  description: The ProcessPendingActions method handles queued or deferred operations
    that are associated with a given group in the instance coordination framework.
    This method is typically invoked during instance management to ensure that all
    pending group-related actions such as teleportations, loot distribution, or event
    triggers are properly executed. It ensures synchronization and consistency of
    group state within the context of a shared instance environment. The method operates
    on the provided Group object and processes any pending tasks that have been scheduled
    for execution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose pending actions need to be processed.
      This parameter must not be null, as attempting to process actions for a null
      group will result in undefined behavior or crash.
  returns: None. The method performs operations internally and does not return any
    value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ProcessPendingActions
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n\
      \    sInstanceCoordination->ProcessPendingActions(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the context of instance management
    or group handling logic. It is not thread-safe and should typically be invoked
    on the main game thread to avoid race conditions. The internal implementation
    may iterate through pending actions and execute them sequentially, so performance
    can depend on the number of pending actions for a given group.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Group pointer will likely lead to a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that all groups passed to this method are valid
    and properly initialized before calling ProcessPendingActions.
