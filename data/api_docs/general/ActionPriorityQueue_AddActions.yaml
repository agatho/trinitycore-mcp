  class: ActionPriorityQueue
  method: AddActions
  signature: void ActionPriorityQueue::AddActions(const int & actions)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a set of actions to the action priority queue for execution.
  description: The AddActions method is used to insert a collection of actions into
    the ActionPriorityQueue. This method allows AI systems or game logic to schedule
    multiple actions that will be processed according to their defined priorities.
    The actions are typically represented as integer identifiers and are queued for
    later execution by the queue's processing mechanism. This method does not execute
    the actions directly but rather prepares them for subsequent processing within
    the priority queue framework.
  parameters:
  - name: actions
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the actions to be
      added to the queue. The integer likely encodes one or more action identifiers,
      potentially using bit flags or a similar encoding scheme to represent multiple
      actions in a single value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding Single Action
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue queue;

      int action = 1001;

      queue.AddActions(action);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Actions via Bitmask
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue queue;

      int actions = 0x000F; // Represents four actions with IDs 1, 2, 4, and 8

      queue.AddActions(actions);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely operates on a bitfield or similar encoding system where
    individual bits represent different actions. The implementation may perform validation
    to ensure that only valid action IDs are added to the queue. This method is typically
    called from AI logic or game state management systems when actions need to be
    scheduled for execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer parameter contains valid action identifiers, as
    invalid values might lead to undefined behavior or silent failures in the queue
    processing. The method does not validate individual action IDs, so care should
    be taken to ensure proper encoding.
