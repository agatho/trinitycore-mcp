  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::IsTargetUnderAttack(Unit * target, Group * group)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is currently under attack by any group member.
  description: The IsTargetUnderAttack method determines whether a specified target
    unit is currently being attacked by any member of the provided group. This utility
    function is typically used in AI behavior logic to assess the combat state of
    targets and make decisions about targeting, threat management, or assistance actions.
    The method evaluates the current threat situation by checking if the target has
    any attackers within the group's scope. It returns true if at least one group
    member is attacking the target, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target being checked
      for attack status. Must not be null.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the group members whose attacks
      on the target are being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if any member of the specified group is currently attacking
    the target unit; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (action->IsTargetUnderAttack(target, group)) {\n    // Target is already\
      \ being attacked by group members\n    // Consider other actions or avoid duplicate\
      \ attacks\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with unit AI to prevent redundant attacks
    code: "if (!action->IsTargetUnderAttack(target, player->GetGroup())) {\n    //\
      \ No group member is attacking target, proceed with attack\n    player->Attack(target,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Target already under attack, do not initiate new\
      \ attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal threat management system of TrinityCore.
    It may not account for all possible attack scenarios involving multiple attackers
    or complex combat states. The method assumes that group members are in a valid
    combat state and that the target unit is properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both target and group parameters are valid (non-null) before
    calling this method, as passing null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This function should not be used outside of AI context without
    proper validation.
