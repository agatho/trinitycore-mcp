  class: Action
  method: GetCooldown
  signature: float Action::GetCooldown() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current cooldown time remaining for the action in seconds.
  description: The GetCooldown method returns the amount of time remaining until the
    action can be used again, measured in seconds. This value represents the active
    cooldown period of the action, which is typically set when the action is initiated
    or cast. The returned float value indicates how many seconds are left before the
    action becomes available for use. If the action is currently on cooldown, this
    method will return a positive float value. If the action is not on cooldown, it
    will return zero or a negative value depending on implementation details. This
    method is commonly used in AI logic and player behavior systems to determine when
    an action can be executed next.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the remaining cooldown time in seconds. A positive
    value indicates the action is on cooldown, while zero or a negative value typically
    means the action is ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown check
    code: "if (action->GetCooldown() <= 0.0f)\n{\n    // Action is ready to be used\n\
      \    action->Cast();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Action is on cooldown, wait for remaining\
      \ time\n    float remaining = action->GetCooldown();\n    // Handle cooldown\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cooldown in AI decision making
    code: "float cooldown = action->GetCooldown();\nif (cooldown <= 0.0f)\n{\n   \
      \ // Execute the action immediately\n    action->Execute();\n}\nelse if (cooldown\
      \ < 5.0f)\n{\n    // Consider alternative actions or wait\n    AI->SetNextActionTime(cooldown);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other action-related methods
    to implement proper cooldown handling in game logic. The returned value may be
    affected by various factors such as buffs, debuffs, or special abilities that
    modify cooldown times. In some implementations, this method might return a negative
    value when the action is not on cooldown, which should be handled appropriately
    by checking if the value is less than or equal to zero.
  warnings: Be aware that the exact behavior of this method may vary depending on
    the specific implementation within TrinityCore's AI system. Always verify that
    the returned value represents actual cooldown time and not some other internal
    timer value. Using this method in tight loops without proper caching can lead
    to performance issues, especially when checking multiple actions.
