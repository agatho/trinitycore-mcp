  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSetBankAutosortDisabled(const WorldPackets::Item::SetBankAutosortDisabled
    & setBankAutosortDisabled)
documentation:
  brief: Toggles the bank autosort disabled flag for the player's session.
  description: The HandleSetBankAutosortDisabled method processes a client packet
    that informs the server whether the player has disabled automatic sorting of their
    bank inventory. This setting affects how the game handles item organization in
    the player's bank tab. When enabled, the client will not automatically sort items
    when they are moved or added to the bank. The method updates the session's internal
    state to reflect this preference, which may influence future bank-related operations
    and UI behavior. This functionality allows players to maintain custom item arrangements
    in their bank without interference from automatic sorting mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: setBankAutosortDisabled
    description: A packet containing the player's request to enable or disable bank
      autosort functionality. The packet structure includes a boolean flag indicating
      the desired state of the autosort setting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetBankAutosortDisabled(const WorldPackets::Item::SetBankAutosortDisabled\
      \ & setBankAutosortDisabled)\n{\n    // Update session state based on client's\
      \ request\n    _player->SetBankAutosortDisabled(setBankAutosortDisabled.Disabled);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the item management system and directly interacts
    with player inventory settings. It should be called only when a valid packet from
    the client is received, ensuring proper synchronization between client and server
    states.
