documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask for forced reactions in a zone player.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with forced player reactions within a specific zone. This operation typically
    occurs when the system needs to reset or clear any pending updates or modifications
    to the player's forced reaction state. It ensures that subsequent operations do
    not carry over stale change flags, maintaining consistency in the zone's reaction
    management system. The method is generally called internally by the core systems
    during state synchronization or cleanup processes.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ZonePlayerForcedReaction reaction;

      reaction.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during internal state management and should
    not be called directly by external modules unless specifically required for synchronization
    purposes. It does not affect the actual forced reaction values, only the tracking
    of changes.
