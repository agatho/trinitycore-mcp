  signature: void RuneManager::ConvertRune(RuneType from, RuneType to)
documentation:
  brief: Converts a rune of one type to another type within the RuneManager.
  description: The ConvertRune method is responsible for transforming a rune from
    one RuneType to another within the RuneManager system. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's combat mechanics, particularly for Death Knights who
    utilize runes as part of their resource management system. The method likely modifies
    the internal state of the rune manager to reflect the conversion, potentially
    affecting cooldowns or availability of specific rune types. It operates on the
    principle that certain game actions or abilities may require converting one type
    of rune into another, such as when a Death Knight uses a spell that consumes a
    blood rune and converts it into a death rune.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The RuneType that is being converted from. This specifies the source
      rune type before conversion.
  - name: to
    description: The RuneType that the rune is being converted to. This specifies
      the target rune type after conversion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rune Conversion Example
    code: 'RuneManager runeMgr;

      runeMgr.ConvertRune(RUNE_BLOOD, RUNE_DEATH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Death Knight Rune Conversion
    code: "// Convert a blood rune to a death rune for a Death Knight\r\nRuneManager*\
      \ dkRuneMgr = player->GetRuneManager();\r\ndkRuneMgr->ConvertRune(RUNE_BLOOD,\
      \ RUNE_DEATH);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal rune cooldown system and may
    trigger updates to the player's UI or game state. Developers should ensure that
    both 'from' and 'to' parameters are valid RuneType values to prevent undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper validation of rune types can
    lead to inconsistent game state or unexpected behavior in combat mechanics. Ensure
    that conversions follow the game's established rules for rune usage and transformation.
