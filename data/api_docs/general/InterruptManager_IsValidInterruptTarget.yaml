  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsValidInterruptTarget
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsValidInterruptTarget(Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit is a valid target for interruption.
  description: The IsValidInterruptTarget method checks if a given Unit object can
    be interrupted by spell or ability effects. This validation typically ensures
    that the target is not immune to interruption, is within acceptable range, and
    meets other game-specific criteria such as being alive, not stealthed, or not
    under certain protective states. The method is commonly used in interrupt-related
    systems like spell casting, aura applications, or combat mechanics where a target's
    eligibility for interruption needs to be verified before proceeding with the interruption
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for validity as
      an interrupt target. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a valid interrupt target, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the unit either does not meet
    criteria such as being alive, immune to interruption, or in an invalid state for
    interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interruption logic
    code: "if (interruptManager->IsValidInterruptTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with interrupting the target\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell(currentSpell);\n\
      } else {\n    // Target cannot be interrupted, handle accordingly\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Target cannot be interrupted.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a custom interrupt handler
    code: "void CustomInterruptHandler(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    if (!caster\
      \ || !target) return;\n\n    InterruptManager* im = caster->GetInterruptManager();\n\
      \    if (im && im->IsValidInterruptTarget(target)) {\n        // Perform the\
      \ actual interruption logic\n        target->RemoveAurasByType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH);\n\
      \        target->SendInterrupted(0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as verifying that the unit is alive,
    not in an immune state, and not under effects that prevent interruption. It may
    also consider faction relationships, stealth status, or other combat-related flags
    depending on the implementation within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    be aware that this method might be used frequently during spell casting or aura
    updates, so performance could be a concern if not optimized.
