  signature: void InstanceCoordination::EnablePredictiveCoordination(Group * group,
    bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables predictive coordination for a specified group within
    an instance.
  description: The EnablePredictiveCoordination method controls whether a group in
    a World of Warcraft instance will utilize predictive coordination mechanics. Predictive
    coordination typically involves pre-planning and synchronizing player actions
    to optimize instance completion, reduce congestion, and improve overall group
    performance. This method allows administrators or game systems to toggle this
    behavior on or off for specific groups. The functionality is particularly relevant
    in raid environments where coordinated timing and positioning are crucial for
    success. When enabled, the system may adjust how player movements, spell casting,
    and object interactions are handled within the instance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which predictive coordination should
      be enabled or disabled. Must not be null.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      predictive coordination for the specified group.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Enable Predictive Coordination for a Group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      InstanceCoordination::EnablePredictiveCoordination(myGroup, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Predictive Coordination for a Raid Group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(raidLeaderGuid);\n\
      if (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup()) {\n    InstanceCoordination::EnablePredictiveCoordination(raidGroup,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags within the InstanceCoordination
    system. It may affect how instance timers, encounter mechanics, and player synchronization
    are handled. The change takes effect immediately for all members of the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. Disabling predictive coordination during active encounters
    might cause unexpected gameplay disruptions or performance issues.
