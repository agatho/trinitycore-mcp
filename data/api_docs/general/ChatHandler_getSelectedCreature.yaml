  method: getSelectedCreature
  signature: Creature * ChatHandler::getSelectedCreature()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Creature object selected by the player in the game world.
  description: The getSelectedCreature method retrieves the currently selected creature
    object from the player's selection context. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore server's command handling system to access the target creature
    for various administrative or debugging commands. The returned pointer may be
    null if no creature is currently selected or if the selected object is not a creature.
    The method relies on the ChatHandler's internal selection state and should only
    be called when the player has an active selection in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object that is currently selected by the player,
    or nullptr if no creature is selected or if the selection is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check selected creature
    code: "Creature* target = handler->getSelectedCreature();\nif (target)\n{\n  \
      \  handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Selected creature: %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    handler->SendSysMessage(\"No creature selected.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using selected creature in a command implementation
    code: "bool HandleTeleportCreatureCommand(ChatHandler* handler, char const* args)\n\
      {\n    Creature* target = handler->getSelectedCreature();\n    if (!target)\n\
      \    {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"You must select a creature first.\"\
      );\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    Player* player = handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer();\n\
      \    target->NearTeleportTo(player->GetPosition());\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Teleported creature %s to your location.\", target->GetName().c_str());\n  \
      \  return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method depends on the player's current selection state and will only
    return valid results when a creature is actively selected in the game world. The
    returned pointer should not be deleted or modified directly as it represents an
    object managed by the server's core systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a creature is actually selected
    may result in a null pointer dereference if not properly checked. Always validate
    the return value before using it in operations that require a valid Creature object.
