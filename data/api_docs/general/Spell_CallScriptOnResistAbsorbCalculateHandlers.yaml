documentation:
  brief: Calls script handlers to calculate resist and absorb amounts for spell damage
  description: This method invokes all registered script handlers that are designed
    to calculate resistance and absorption values for incoming spell damage. It processes
    the damage information through a series of callbacks, allowing custom scripts
    to modify the final resist and absorb amounts before they are applied to the spell's
    damage calculation. The method is typically used during spell processing when
    dealing with damage over time or direct damage spells where resistance and absorption
    mechanics are involved.
  parameters:
  - name: damageInfo
    description: Contains detailed information about the incoming damage, including
      type, amount, and other relevant parameters that will be processed by script
      handlers
  - name: resistAmount
    description: Reference to the resistance value that can be modified by script
      handlers; represents how much of the damage is resisted
  - name: absorbAmount
    description: Reference to the absorption value that can be modified by script
      handlers; represents how much of the damage is absorbed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      DamageInfo damageInfo;

      uint32 resistAmount = 0;

      int32 absorbAmount = 0;

      spell->CallScriptOnResistAbsorbCalculateHandlers(damageInfo, resistAmount, absorbAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell processing phases when damage
    calculations are being performed. It should be used carefully as it may affect
    game balance if not properly implemented. The method relies on script handlers
    registered through the script system, which must be properly configured to avoid
    errors.
  warnings: The method does not directly return values but modifies parameters passed
    by reference; developers must ensure that all script handlers are correctly implemented
    and do not cause memory issues or incorrect calculations. Improper handling of
    resist/absorb amounts can lead to unexpected damage values or game balance issues.
