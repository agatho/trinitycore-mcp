  signature: bool BotAI::IsInCombat() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot is currently engaged in combat.
  description: The IsInCombat method determines whether the bot character is currently
    in a combat state. This method evaluates the bot's current combat status by checking
    various internal flags and conditions that indicate active engagement with enemies.
    The function returns true if the bot has an active combat target and is participating
    in combat, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for AI behavior
    logic, as it allows the bot to make decisions based on its current combat state,
    such as whether to continue attacking, flee, or switch targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently in combat (has an active combat target
    and is engaged), false otherwise.

  - title: Basic Combat State Check
    code: "if (botAI->IsInCombat()) {\n    // Bot is in combat, perform combat actions\n\
      \    botAI->AttackCurrentTarget();\n} else {\n    // Bot is not in combat, resume\
      \ normal behavior\n    botAI->MoveToNearestWaypoint();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat State Monitoring
    code: "void BotBehavior::Update() {\n    if (IsInCombat()) {\n        // Maintain\
      \ combat stance\n        if (botAI->GetHealthPercent() < 30) {\n           \
      \ botAI->UseHealthPotion();\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Look for new\
      \ targets or patrol\n        botAI->ScanForEnemies();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal combat state tracking system of the bot
    AI. The result may be affected by combat state transitions that occur asynchronously
    with other AI updates. For accurate results, this check should typically be performed
    during the bot's update cycle.
  warnings: The combat state might not immediately reflect changes in the bot's actual
    engagement due to asynchronous updates or network latency in multiplayer environments.
    Always consider caching the result if checking frequently within a single update
    cycle.
