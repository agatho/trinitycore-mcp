documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SceneObject instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the world scene system.
  description: The SceneObject constructor initializes a new instance of the SceneObject
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values required for
    integration into the TrinityCore world scene system. This method is automatically
    invoked when creating a new SceneObject object and ensures that all member variables
    are properly initialized before the object can be used in scene-related operations
    such as displaying visual effects, managing scene triggers, or handling scene-based
    interactions. The constructor typically sets up basic object properties like GUID,
    position, orientation, and scene-specific flags while ensuring compatibility with
    the core game engine's scene management subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SceneObject instance
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      // The object is now initialized and ready for use in scene operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when objects are created through factory methods or during world initialization.
    Developers should not directly instantiate SceneObject objects unless specifically
    required by custom scene implementations. The constructor performs minimal initialization
    and does not perform any network communication or external resource loading.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of SceneObject using this constructor should be avoided
    in most cases as the class is typically managed by the core framework. Improper
    use may lead to undefined behavior or memory management issues if not properly
    integrated with the scene system's lifecycle management.
