api:
  class: LootAnalysis
  method: AnalyzeArmorItem
  signature: float LootAnalysis::AnalyzeArmorItem(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a numerical score representing the value of an armor
    item for a given player.
  description: The AnalyzeArmorItem method computes a relevance score for a specific
    armor item based on the player's current gear, class, specialization, and other
    relevant factors. This score helps determine whether the item is worth looting
    or if it should be passed over in favor of better options. The method considers
    item level, armor type, stat distribution, and the player's existing inventory
    to calculate this value. It is typically used during loot evaluation processes
    within the TrinityCore framework to assist in automated loot distribution decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory and preferences are
      considered when evaluating the armor item.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the armor item being analyzed, including item ID, stats, and quality.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated relevance score of the armor
    item for the specified player. Higher scores indicate items that are more valuable
    or beneficial to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Evaluation
    code: "float score = lootAnalysis.AnalyzeArmorItem(player, lootItem);\nif (score\
      \ > 50.0f) {\n    // Consider this item for direct loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Score to Determine Loot Priority
    code: "float score = lootAnalysis.AnalyzeArmorItem(player, lootItem);\nswitch\
      \ (static_cast<int>(score)) {\n    case 0 ... 20:\n        // Low value item,\
      \ pass\n        break;\n    case 21 ... 50:\n        // Medium value, consider\
      \ for group loot\n        break;\n    default:\n        // High value item,\
      \ prioritize\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LootAnalysis system and relies on internal player
    data such as class, specialization, and current equipment. The scoring algorithm
    may be adjusted based on game updates or custom configurations in TrinityCore.
    Performance is generally good for single item evaluations but could impact heavily
    threaded loot systems if called excessively.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned score is relative to the player's
    current situation and may change as the player levels or equips new gear.
