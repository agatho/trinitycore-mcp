  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateGroupDamage(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates damage application to all group members during a dungeon encounter.
  description: The CoordinateGroupDamage method distributes damage events to all players
    within a specified group during an active dungeon encounter. This method ensures
    that all group members receive appropriate damage handling based on the encounter's
    mechanics and difficulty settings. It typically handles synchronization of damage
    application across the group, accounting for factors such as raid composition,
    player health states, and encounter-specific rules. The method is designed to
    maintain consistency in group-based combat scenarios within dungeon environments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who will receive damage
      coordination. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object defining the current encounter
      parameters and damage rules. Contains encounter-specific data such as difficulty,
      damage multipliers, and mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateGroupDamage(group, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with conditional damage handling
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::HandleSpecialDamage(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    if (encounter.GetDifficulty() == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n\
      \    {\n        dungeonBehavior.CoordinateGroupDamage(group, encounter);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and encounter parameters are properly
    initialized before calling. It may perform internal validation to ensure players
    are within the same instance and zone. The method is typically called during encounter
    start or damage event processing phases.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as it will cause undefined behavior if passed an invalid group. Avoid
    calling this method outside of proper dungeon encounter contexts to prevent synchronization
    issues.
