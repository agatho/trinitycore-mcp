  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: CalculateDistance3D
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::CalculateDistance3D(const int & pos1, const
    int & pos2)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the three-dimensional Euclidean distance between two positions
    in the game world.
  description: The CalculateDistance3D method computes the straight-line distance
    between two points in three-dimensional space (X, Y, Z coordinates) within the
    World of Warcraft game environment. This method is typically used by AI behaviors
    to determine proximity between entities such as a follower and its leader. It
    performs a standard Euclidean distance calculation using the formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2
    + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2). The positions are expected to be provided as integer
    coordinates, likely representing grid-based or world coordinates in the game's
    coordinate system. This method is essential for pathfinding, formation maintenance,
    and AI decision-making processes where spatial relationships between units are
    critical.
  parameters:
  - name: pos1
    description: Reference to the first position coordinate (likely X, Y, or Z component).
      This parameter represents one of the three-dimensional coordinates in the game
      world.
  - name: pos2
    description: Reference to the second position coordinate (likely X, Y, or Z component).
      This parameter represents another of the three-dimensional coordinates in the
      game world.
  returns: Returns a floating-point value representing the Euclidean distance between
    the two specified positions. The result is always non-negative and indicates the
    straight-line distance in game units.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Calculation
    code: 'int x1 = 100, y1 = 200, z1 = 50;

      int x2 = 150, y2 = 250, z2 = 75;

      float distance = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance3D(x1, x2);

      // Calculates the X-axis distance between two points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete 3D Distance Calculation
    code: 'int posX1 = 100, posY1 = 200, posZ1 = 50;

      int posX2 = 150, posY2 = 250, posZ2 = 75;

      float dx = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance3D(posX1, posX2);

      float dy = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance3D(posY1, posY2);

      float dz = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance3D(posZ1, posZ2);

      float totalDistance = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz);

      // Calculates complete 3D distance using multiple calls'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input parameters represent valid coordinate
    values within the game world's coordinate system. The implementation likely uses
    integer coordinates internally and converts them to floating-point for precise
    calculations. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight operation suitable for frequent
    use in AI decision-making loops. The method may be part of a larger behavior system
    where distance calculations are used to determine when a follower should move
    closer to or maintain distance from its leader.
  warnings: The method signature suggests that it takes references to integers, but
    the actual implementation details are unclear. If this is meant to calculate distance
    between two full 3D positions, it's likely that both parameters represent single
    components of each position (e.g., X coordinates) rather than complete coordinate
    sets. Ensure proper usage of coordinate system conventions in TrinityCore when
    integrating with other systems.
