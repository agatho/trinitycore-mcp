  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: SetData
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::SetData(uint32 id, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a data value associated with a specific ID for the area trigger AI.
  description: The SetData method allows an AreaTriggerAI instance to store or update
    a numeric value linked to a unique identifier. This functionality is commonly
    used in TrinityCore to manage state information within area triggers, such as
    tracking quest progress, enabling/disabling certain behaviors, or coordinating
    events between different game systems. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input values and directly assigns them to internal storage. It is typically
    invoked by other game systems or scripts when a change in the area trigger's state
    needs to be communicated.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier used to associate the data value with a specific
      context or variable within the area trigger AI.
  - name: value
    description: The numeric value to be stored and associated with the provided ID.
      This can represent any state information relevant to the area trigger's behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a quest progress flag
    code: "void OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    // Set the quest progress flag\
      \ to 1 when player enters\n    SetData(QUEST_PROGRESS_FLAG, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Enabling an area trigger effect
    code: "void ActivateTrigger()\n{\n    // Enable the trigger by setting a flag\
      \ to 1\n    SetData(TRIGGER_ENABLED_FLAG, 1);\n}\n\nvoid DeactivateTrigger()\n\
      {\n    // Disable the trigger by setting a flag to 0\n    SetData(TRIGGER_ENABLED_FLAG,\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTriggerAI base class and is intended for use
    within custom area trigger implementations. The internal storage mechanism for
    these data values is not specified in the public API, so developers should be
    aware that the actual persistence and retrieval of this data depends on how the
    AI system is implemented in the specific area trigger script.
  warnings: Ensure that the ID values used are consistent across all related systems
    to prevent conflicts or unexpected behavior. Since this method does not validate
    inputs, passing invalid or out-of-range values may lead to undefined behavior
    if other code relies on specific value ranges.
