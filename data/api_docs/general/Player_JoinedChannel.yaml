documentation:
  brief: Registers a player when they join a channel
  description: This method is called when a player successfully joins a chat channel,
    typically used to update internal channel tracking and notify other players in
    the same channel. The function handles the registration of the player with the
    channel object, ensuring proper communication and synchronization within the game
    world. It's part of the broader chat system implementation where players can participate
    in various channels such as guild, party, or raid channels.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Pointer to the Channel object that the player is joining. This parameter
      represents the specific channel instance being joined by the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::JoinedChannel(Channel * c)\n{\n    // Implementation details\n\
      }\n\n// Usage example:\nPlayer* player = GetPlayer();\nChannel* channel = new\
      \ Channel();\nplayer->JoinedChannel(channel);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during channel join operations
    and may involve synchronization with other players in the same channel. It's important
    to note that this method does not directly handle the actual joining process but
    rather registers the player with the channel object for communication purposes.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player has successfully joined
    a channel; calling it without proper channel joining logic can lead to inconsistent
    state in the game world.
