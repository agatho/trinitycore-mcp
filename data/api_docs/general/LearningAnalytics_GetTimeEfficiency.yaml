  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetTimeEfficiency(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time efficiency percentage for a specified bot
    based on learning analytics data.
  description: The GetTimeEfficiency method computes the time efficiency of a bot
    identified by its GUID. This metric typically represents how effectively a bot
    utilizes time during learning activities or quest completion within the TrinityCore
    framework. The returned value is a floating-point number between 0 and 100, where
    0 indicates no time efficiency and 100 represents perfect time efficiency. The
    method accesses internal learning analytics data structures to determine this
    metric, which may be influenced by factors such as task completion speed, resource
    allocation, and bot performance over time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the time efficiency percentage of the specified
    bot. Values range from 0.0 (no efficiency) to 100.0 (perfect efficiency). Returns
    0.0 if the bot GUID is invalid or no analytics data exists for the specified bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      float efficiency = learningAnalytics->GetTimeEfficiency(botGuid);

      printf("Bot %u has time efficiency: %.2f%%\n", botGuid, efficiency);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Efficiency Check
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 67890;\nfloat efficiency = learningAnalytics->GetTimeEfficiency(botGuid);\n\
      if (efficiency > 80.0f) {\n    printf(\"Highly efficient bot detected\\n\");\n\
      } else if (efficiency > 50.0f) {\n    printf(\"Moderate efficiency\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Low efficiency - requires optimization\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal learning analytics data that may be updated
    asynchronously. The returned value is cached and may not reflect real-time changes
    unless the analytics system has been recently refreshed. Performance impact is
    minimal as it primarily involves data lookup operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot in the system, otherwise the method will return 0.0. This method should not
    be called on bots that have not yet participated in learning activities, as the
    efficiency metrics may not be meaningful.
