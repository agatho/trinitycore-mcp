    & name, ProfilingSessionType sessionType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new profiling session with the specified ID, name, and type.
  description: The ProfilingSession constructor initializes a profiling session object
    with a unique identifier, a descriptive name, and a session type. This method
    sets up the foundational data structure for tracking performance metrics or debugging
    information within the TrinityCore framework. The session ID is typically used
    to uniquely identify this specific profiling session, while the name provides
    human-readable context for the session's purpose. The session type determines
    how the profiling data should be interpreted or handled by the system. This constructor
    is typically called when starting a new profiling activity, such as during server
    startup, module initialization, or performance testing scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique 64-bit identifier for this profiling session. This value
      should be unique across all active profiling sessions to prevent conflicts or
      data corruption.
  - name: name
    description: A descriptive string name for the profiling session. This name is
      used for identification and logging purposes, helping developers understand
      the context of each profiling session.
  - name: sessionType
    description: The type of profiling session being created, which determines how
      the session data should be processed or interpreted by the system. Valid values
      are typically defined by the ProfilingSessionType enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Basic Profiling Session
    code: ProfilingSession session(123456789ULL, "Player Movement Analysis", ProfilingSessionType::MOVEMENT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Server Startup Profiling Session
    code: ProfilingSession startupSession(GetNextSessionId(), "Server Startup Performance",
      ProfilingSessionType::SERVER_STARTUP);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore profiling
    system. Developers should not directly instantiate ProfilingSession objects unless
    implementing custom profiling functionality. The session ID must be unique to
    avoid conflicts with other active sessions. Session names are stored as-is and
    should be kept concise for optimal logging performance.
  warnings: Incorrect session type values may lead to improper handling of profiling
    data or runtime errors. Ensure that the session ID is truly unique across all
    active profiling sessions to prevent data corruption or incorrect metrics reporting.
