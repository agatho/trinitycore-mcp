  signature: bool SocialManager::IsInChannel(const std::string & channelName) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently subscribed to a specified chat channel.
  description: The IsInChannel method determines whether the player associated with
    the SocialManager instance is currently joined to a specific chat channel. This
    functionality is essential for managing player communication within the game's
    social systems, particularly in scenarios where channel membership affects visibility
    or interaction capabilities. The method performs a lookup in the internal channel
    subscription list and returns a boolean result indicating membership status. It
    does not validate the existence of the channel itself, only whether the player
    has joined it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently subscribed to the specified channel;
    otherwise, returns false. This indicates that the player can send and receive
    messages in that channel.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Membership Check
    code: "if (socialManager->IsInChannel(\"Trade\")) {\n    // Player is in Trade\
      \ channel\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are currently in the Trade channel.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is not in Trade channel\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You are not currently in the Trade channel.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Channel Access
    code: "std::string channelName = \"General\";\nif (socialManager->IsInChannel(channelName))\
      \ {\n    // Allow player to send message\n    SendChatMessage(\"Hello everyone!\"\
      , channelName);\n} else {\n    // Prompt player to join the channel first\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You must join the General channel first.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's current social state and reflects only
    the immediate channel subscriptions. It does not account for temporary or server-side
    restrictions that might prevent communication even if the player is technically
    in a channel. The implementation likely uses an internal hash map or similar data
    structure for O(1) lookup performance.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks membership status and does not validate
    whether the channel exists or is accessible. If used in conjunction with channel
    creation or joining logic, ensure proper error handling for invalid channel names
    or server restrictions.
