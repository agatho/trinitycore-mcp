  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ExecuteOptimalStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteOptimalStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the optimal role assignment strategy for a group based on player
    roles and class distributions.
  description: The ExecuteOptimalStrategy method determines and assigns appropriate
    roles to players within a group to optimize team performance. It analyzes the
    composition of the group, including player classes, roles (tank, healer, damage
    dealer), and other relevant factors to ensure balanced role distribution. This
    method is typically invoked during group formation or when role changes occur
    to maintain an optimal team setup for dungeon or raid encounters. The strategy
    considers class-specific capabilities, current group needs, and player availability
    to assign roles such as tank, healer, or DPS in a way that maximizes the group's
    effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteOptimalStrategy
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsInInstance())\n\
      {\n    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteOptimalStrategy(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has been properly initialized and contains
    valid player data. It may modify player roles in-place and should be called with
    appropriate synchronization if used in a multi-threaded environment. The actual
    strategy implementation may vary based on game version and configuration settings.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid group pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and has players before invoking
    this method. This method modifies internal group state, so it should not be called
    during critical sections where group integrity must be preserved.
