  class: BattlePetManager
  method: OptimizeTeamForOpponent
  signature: int BattlePetManager::OptimizeTeamForOpponent(int * player, PetFamily
    opponentFamily) const
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes a player's battle pet team for maximum effectiveness against a
    specified opponent pet family.
  description: The OptimizeTeamForOpponent method adjusts the composition of a player's
    active battle pet team to enhance their chances of winning against a specific
    opponent pet family. This optimization process typically involves evaluating the
    current team's strengths and weaknesses relative to the opponent's family type,
    potentially swapping pets or reordering the team lineup to improve synergy and
    damage output. The method is commonly used in PvP battle pet encounters where
    strategic team composition can significantly impact the outcome of battles. It
    may also consider factors such as pet abilities, elemental resistances, and type
    advantages when determining the optimal team configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter specifies which player's team should be optimized.
  - name: opponentFamily
    description: An enum or integer value indicating the pet family type of the opponent.
      This determines how the optimization algorithm weights different pet types and
      abilities when reconfiguring the team.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the success status of the optimization
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful optimization, while
    non-zero values may indicate errors such as invalid player ID, unsupported opponent
    family type, or internal system failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Team Optimization
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nPetFamily enemyFamily = PET_FAMILY_BEAST;\nBattlePetManager*\
      \ petManager = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetManager();\nint result = petManager->OptimizeTeamForOpponent(&playerId,\
      \ enemyFamily);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Team optimized successfully\n  \
      \  printf(\"Team optimized for Beast family opponents\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to optimize team: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on pet stats, abilities,
    and elemental affinities. It may cache optimized configurations for performance
    reasons and should be called before engaging in battles where team composition
    is critical. The exact optimization logic depends on the game's current battle
    pet mechanics and balance updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player session, as invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or errors. Also
    note that this method modifies the active pet team in place, so any unsaved changes
    might be overwritten during optimization.
