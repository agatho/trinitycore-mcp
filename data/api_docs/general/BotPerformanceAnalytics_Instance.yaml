  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: Instance
  signature: BotPerformanceAnalytics & BotPerformanceAnalytics::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class for accessing
    bot performance tracking metrics.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern to provide global
    access to a single, shared instance of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class. This
    allows various parts of the TrinityCore server to collect, track, and retrieve
    performance data related to AI bots without requiring explicit instantiation or
    managing multiple instances. The returned reference provides access to all performance
    analytics functionality including bot activity monitoring, response time measurements,
    and resource utilization tracking. This method is thread-safe and ensures that
    only one instance exists throughout the application lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the singleton BotPerformanceAnalytics instance, allowing
    direct access to all performance tracking methods and data members of the class.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Analytics
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics& analytics = BotPerformanceAnalytics::Instance();

      analytics.RecordBotAction("Movement", 150ms);

      uint32 totalActions = analytics.GetTotalActions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application. Since
    this is a performance-critical analytics system, ensure that calls to this method
    are not made excessively in tight loops.
