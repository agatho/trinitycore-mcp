  method: GetFirstStep
  signature: const ScenarioStepEntry * Scenario::GetFirstStep() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the first step entry of the scenario.
  description: The GetFirstStep method retrieves the initial step definition for a
    scenario. This is typically used to determine where in a scenario sequence the
    player currently stands or to begin processing the scenario flow from its starting
    point. The returned pointer points to an immutable ScenarioStepEntry object which
    contains metadata about the first step such as objectives, rewards, and prerequisites.
    This method does not modify any internal state of the scenario object and is safe
    to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the ScenarioStepEntry representing the first step in
    the scenario. Returns nullptr if the scenario has no defined steps or if the scenario
    data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access first scenario step
    code: "const ScenarioStepEntry* firstStep = scenario->GetFirstStep();\nif (firstStep\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the first step\n    sLog->outString(\"First\
      \ step ID: %u\", firstStep->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using first step to initialize scenario progression
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nconst ScenarioStepEntry* firstStep\
      \ = scenario->GetFirstStep();\nif (firstStep != nullptr)\n{\n    // Set up initial\
      \ objectives based on first step\n    player->SetObjectiveProgress(firstStep->Objective1,\
      \ 0);\n    player->SetObjectiveProgress(firstStep->Objective2, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the scenario has been properly initialized and loaded
    with valid step data. The returned pointer is only valid as long as the scenario
    object remains in scope and has not been destroyed or reset.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned pointer will be non-null; always check
    for nullptr before dereferencing. Accessing members of the returned ScenarioStepEntry
    may lead to undefined behavior if the scenario data structure is corrupted or
    improperly initialized.
