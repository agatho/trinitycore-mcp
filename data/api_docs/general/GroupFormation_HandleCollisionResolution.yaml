  signature: void GroupFormation::HandleCollisionResolution()
documentation:
  brief: Resolves collisions between group members during formation movement to prevent
    overlapping or invalid positioning.
  description: The HandleCollisionResolution method is responsible for managing and
    resolving positional conflicts that occur when group members attempt to occupy
    the same space or move into invalid locations during group formation updates.
    This method ensures that group members maintain proper spacing and do not intersect
    with each other or with obstacles in the environment. It typically operates during
    group movement updates, adjusting individual member positions to maintain formation
    integrity while respecting world boundaries and collision constraints. The method
    may be invoked automatically by the GroupFormation system or manually during specific
    formation adjustments.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Movement
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::UpdateGroupFormation()\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    groupFormation->HandleCollisionResolution();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with movement updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving vector math and spatial
    queries to determine valid positions for group members. It may involve temporary
    adjustments to member positions that are reverted if conflicts persist. The method
    is expected to be called frequently during active group movement scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of collision resolution can lead to group members becoming
    stuck or overlapping, which may cause visual glitches or gameplay issues. This
    method should not be called during critical sections where position data might
    be inconsistent.
