  class: AreaTriggerShapeInfo
  method: IsPolygon
  signature: bool AreaTriggerShapeInfo::IsPolygon() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger shape is defined as a polygon.
  description: The IsPolygon method checks if the current AreaTriggerShapeInfo instance
    represents a polygonal area trigger shape. This is useful for determining how
    the area trigger's boundaries are defined and processed within the game engine.
    Polygonal shapes typically consist of multiple vertices that define a closed shape,
    as opposed to circular or rectangular shapes. The method returns true if the shape
    type is classified as a polygon, and false otherwise. This information is crucial
    for proper handling of area trigger effects, collision detection, and visual representation
    in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger shape is defined as a polygon; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area Trigger Shape is Polygonal
    code: "AreaTriggerShapeInfo shapeInfo;\n// Assume shapeInfo has been initialized\
      \ with a polygonal shape\nif (shapeInfo.IsPolygon()) {\n    // Handle polygonal\
      \ area trigger logic\n    std::cout << \"This area trigger uses a polygon shape.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle non-polygonal area trigger logic\n\
      \    std::cout << \"This area trigger does not use a polygon shape.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other area trigger shape
    checking methods to determine the appropriate rendering and collision handling
    for different types of area triggers. The implementation likely relies on internal
    shape type flags or enumerations that distinguish between polygonal and non-polygonal
    shapes.
