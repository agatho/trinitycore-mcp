documentation:
  brief: Resets the spell timer to its initial cooldown period.
  description: The ReSetTimer method resets the cooldown timer for a spell, effectively
    setting it back to its original cooldown state. This is commonly used when a spell
    is reactivated or when a player's cooldown is reset after certain game mechanics
    such as applying a buff or using a consumable item. The method ensures that the
    spell cannot be cast again until the cooldown period has elapsed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a spell timer after casting
    code: 'Spell* spell = player->GetSpellByProto(12345);

      spell->ReSetTimer();

      // Spell timer is now reset to initial cooldown'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically resets the cooldown timer for a spell, but does not
    actually reset the spell's mana cost or other resource requirements. It should
    be used carefully in conjunction with other methods that manage cooldowns.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in spells being available before
    their cooldown period has elapsed, potentially leading to game balance issues
    or unexpected behavior.
