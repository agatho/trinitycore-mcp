  class: LootCoordination
  method: MediateLootDispute
  signature: void LootCoordination::MediateLootDispute(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item, const int & disputingPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves a loot dispute within a group by mediating between players who are
    competing for the same item.
  description: The MediateLootDispute method is responsible for handling situations
    in World of Warcraft where multiple players have expressed interest in the same
    loot item, typically during group loot scenarios. This function manages the resolution
    process by determining how to fairly distribute or assign the contested item among
    the disputing players. It operates within the context of a group and considers
    the current loot distribution rules, such as need-before-greed systems or round-robin
    assignment. The method ensures that loot disputes are resolved according to established
    game mechanics and group leadership policies.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group involved
      in the loot dispute. Must be a valid group with at least two members who are
      disputing the item.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      disputed item, including its ID, stack size, and other relevant properties.
  - name: disputingPlayers
    description: Integer value indicating the number of players who have expressed
      interest in the contested loot item. This determines how many players will be
      involved in the dispute resolution process.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Loot Dispute Mediation
    code: "void HandleLootDispute(Group* group, LootItem const& item)\n{\n    int\
      \ disputingPlayers = 2;\n    LootCoordination::instance()->MediateLootDispute(group,\
      \ item, disputingPlayers);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a loot dispute arises during group
    loot distribution. It relies on the group's loot settings and leadership to determine
    how to resolve the conflict. The implementation may involve sending messages to
    players, updating loot state, or triggering additional loot processing logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and that the item reference points
    to an actual contested item before calling this method. Incorrect usage could
    lead to undefined behavior or improper loot distribution.
