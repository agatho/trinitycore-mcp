  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseCooldownPacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseCooldownPacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and analyzes cooldown information sent in a WorldPacket from a
    player session.
  description: The ParseCooldownPacket method is responsible for interpreting cooldown
    data received from a client session through a WorldPacket. It extracts relevant
    cooldown information such as spell IDs, cooldown durations, and remaining times,
    which are typically used by the playerbot system to make intelligent decisions
    about when abilities can be used again. This method plays a crucial role in simulating
    realistic player behavior within the TrinityCore framework, particularly for AI-controlled
    characters (bots) that must respect game mechanics like spell cooldowns. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal state or triggers actions based
    on the parsed cooldown data.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      from which the packet originated. This session contains contextual information
      about the player and their current game state.
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPacket containing the cooldown data sent by the client.
      The packet structure is expected to follow standard TrinityCore network protocols
      for cooldown updates, typically including spell identifiers and timing information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Playerbot Logic
    code: "void MyPlayerbotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Assume we have a reference to the\
      \ sniffer\n    PlayerbotPacketSniffer* sniffer = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPacketSniffer();\n\
      \    WorldSession* session = GetSession();\n    if (session)\n    {\n      \
      \  // Simulate receiving a cooldown packet\n        WorldPacket packet(CMSG_SPELL_COOLDOWN);\n\
      \        sniffer->ParseCooldownPacket(session, packet);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal packet handling mechanism and should
    only be invoked during active session processing. It assumes that the packet contains
    valid cooldown data and may not handle malformed or unexpected packets gracefully.
    The method relies on proper initialization of the WorldSession and its associated
    player state.
  warnings: Improper handling of the session or packet parameters could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the session pointer is valid before calling this
    method, and that the packet structure matches expected formats for cooldown data.
