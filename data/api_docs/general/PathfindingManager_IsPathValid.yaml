  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsPathValid(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a path is valid for navigation in the game world
  description: The IsPathValid method determines whether a previously computed path
    is still valid and can be used for unit movement. This validation typically checks
    if the waypoints of the path are still traversable, if any obstacles have been
    placed, or if the path has become outdated due to dynamic changes in the game
    world. The method is commonly used by AI systems and pathfinding modules to ensure
    that units follow safe and valid routes through the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the path is valid and can be used for movement, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the path needs to be recalculated
    before it can be used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Validation Check
    code: "if (pathfindingManager.IsPathValid(waypoints)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ using the path\n    unit->MoveAlongPath(waypoints);\n} else {\n    // Recalculate\
      \ path if invalid\n    pathfindingManager.CalculateNewPath(unit, targetPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks on path validity without recalculating
    the entire path. It's designed to be called frequently during movement updates
    to ensure smooth navigation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid path will remain valid indefinitely; game state
    changes can invalidate paths quickly. Always validate before using a path for
    unit movement.
