  class: FormationManager
  method: JoinFormation
  signature: bool FormationManager::JoinFormation(const int & groupMembers, FormationType
    formation)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to add a unit to a specified formation type within the FormationManager.
  description: The JoinFormation method is responsible for integrating a unit into
    a predefined formation structure managed by the FormationManager. This method
    typically handles the logic required to assign a unit to a specific formation
    type, such as a group formation or a battle formation, ensuring proper positioning
    and coordination among members. It may involve checking if the formation is valid,
    verifying that the unit can join the formation, and updating internal data structures
    accordingly. The method returns true upon successful addition to the formation
    and false otherwise, indicating potential issues like invalid formation types
    or resource constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: An integer reference representing the number of group members in
      the formation. This parameter likely determines how many units are expected
      to be part of the formation before it is considered complete.
  - name: formation
    description: A FormationType enumeration value specifying the type of formation
      to join. Valid values may include types such as GROUP_FORMATION, BATTLE_FORMATION,
      or other predefined formations within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: Returns true if the unit was successfully added to the specified formation;
    otherwise, returns false. This indicates whether the operation completed without
    errors and the unit was properly integrated into the formation structure.
  examples:
  - title: Joining a Unit to a Group Formation
    code: "FormationManager manager;\nint groupSize = 5;\nFormationType type = GROUP_FORMATION;\n\
      bool result = manager.JoinFormation(groupSize, type);\nif (result) {\n    //\
      \ Unit successfully joined the formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Formation Join Failure
    code: "FormationManager manager;\nint groupSize = 0;\nFormationType type = BATTLE_FORMATION;\n\
      bool result = manager.JoinFormation(groupSize, type);\nif (!result) {\n    //\
      \ Log error or handle failure case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to join formation\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other formation-related APIs
    such as LeaveFormation, GetFormationMembers, and UpdateFormation. Developers should
    ensure that the FormationType passed is valid and supported by the current implementation.
    Performance considerations may arise when joining large groups or frequently updating
    formations.
  warnings: Ensure that groupMembers is a non-negative integer; passing negative values
    might lead to undefined behavior or invalid formation states. Also, calling this
    method on an already joined unit could result in unexpected outcomes unless explicitly
    designed to handle rejoining.
