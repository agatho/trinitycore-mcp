documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a conversation AI can be created for the given script
    ID.
  description: The CanCreateConversationAI method checks if a conversation AI instance
    can be instantiated for a specific script ID. This method is typically used during
    the initialization or activation of conversation systems within TrinityCore's
    scripting framework. It evaluates internal script registries and determines based
    on script type, availability, and system configuration whether creating a new
    conversation AI object is permissible. The method serves as a gatekeeper to ensure
    that only valid and supported conversation scripts are allowed to spawn AI components.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a conversation AI can be created for the specified script
    ID; otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that
    the script ID is invalid, unsupported, or not registered in the system's conversation
    AI manager.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Conversation AI Can Be Created
    code: "if (sScriptMgr->CanCreateConversationAI(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ creating conversation AI\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"script\", \"Conversation AI can\
      \ be created for script ID 12345\");\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid or unsupported\
      \ script ID\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"script\", \"Cannot create conversation AI for\
      \ script ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal scripting system and relies
    on the global ScriptMgr singleton. It should be called before attempting to instantiate
    a conversation AI object to avoid runtime errors or undefined behavior. The method
    may perform registry lookups, so repeated calls for the same script ID could have
    performance implications in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Do not assume that returning true guarantees successful creation of a
    conversation AI; additional validation and initialization steps might be required.
    This method does not validate the actual existence or functionality of the underlying
    script, only whether it is registered for potential AI instantiation.
