documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Guardian Druid AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The GuardianDruidRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the Guardian Druid AI class, setting up internal state and configuration for
    the bot. This method is typically called when creating or spawning a Guardian
    Druid AI character in the game world. It configures the bot's behavior, abilities,
    and combat strategies specific to the Guardian Druid class. The initialization
    process includes setting up spell caches, ability priorities, and AI decision-making
    logic tailored for the druid's guardian form gameplay. This constructor ensures
    that the bot is properly prepared to engage in combat, manage threat, and utilize
    defensive abilities effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      GuardianDruidRefactored druidBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null, otherwise the behavior is undefined. The initialization
    process may take some time as it sets up all necessary spell and ability data
    structures.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object without
    proper cleanup. Passing a null player pointer will likely cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the Player object remains valid for the lifetime of the
    GuardianDruidRefactored instance.
