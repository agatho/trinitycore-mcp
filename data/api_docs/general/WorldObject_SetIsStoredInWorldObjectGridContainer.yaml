  method: SetIsStoredInWorldObjectGridContainer
  signature: void WorldObject::SetIsStoredInWorldObjectGridContainer(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the WorldObject is stored in the grid container for world object
    management.
  description: This method manages the internal state of a WorldObject indicating
    its presence in the grid container used by TrinityCore's world object management
    system. It is typically called during object placement, removal, or movement within
    the game world grid system. The flag controls how the object is tracked and updated
    within the grid's spatial partitioning system. This method should be used carefully
    as improper usage can lead to objects not being properly managed in the world
    grid or causing memory management issues.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting object as stored in grid container
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      obj->SetIsStoredInWorldObjectGridContainer(true);

      // Object is now marked as being managed by the grid system'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing object from grid container tracking
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = GetWorldObject();

      obj->SetIsStoredInWorldObjectGridContainer(false);

      // Object is no longer tracked in grid system, typically before deletion or
      movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the object's presence in the grid-based spatial
    partitioning system. It should be called in conjunction with proper object lifecycle
    management. The internal flag controls how the object is processed during grid
    updates and visibility calculations.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method can cause objects to become lost in the
    grid system, leading to visibility issues or memory leaks. Always ensure this
    flag matches the actual state of the object's placement in the world grid.
