  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::AssessPlayerSkill(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and adjusts player difficulty settings based on player performance
    and progression.
  description: The AssessPlayerSkill method in the AdaptiveDifficulty class analyzes
    a player's combat effectiveness, quest completion rates, and overall progression
    to dynamically adjust the difficulty of encounters and content. This method ensures
    that players are consistently challenged at an appropriate level without being
    overwhelmed or under-stimulated. It typically integrates with the game's adaptive
    difficulty system to modify enemy stats, loot drops, and quest rewards in real-time
    based on player skill assessment. The method operates on a per-player basis and
    may trigger updates to the player's difficulty settings within the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AdaptiveDifficulty diff;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Get player reference\n\
      \ diff.AssessPlayerSkill(player);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during key progression events such as quest
    completion, boss kills, or when a player enters a new zone. The assessment logic
    may consider factors like player level, kill/death ratio, time spent in combat,
    and achievement progress. Implementation details are likely tied to internal difficulty
    scaling algorithms that maintain game balance.
  warnings: Ensure the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. This method modifies player state and should not be called
    during critical sections where player data consistency is required.
