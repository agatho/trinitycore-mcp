  brief: Teaches all passive abilities to the pet.
  description: The LearnPetPassives method is responsible for granting all available
    passive abilities to a pet. This method ensures that the pet inherits all the
    passive skills associated with its creature type and current level. It typically
    gets invoked during pet creation, leveling up, or when a new pet is summoned.
    The implementation iterates through the pet's creature template and applies relevant
    passive spells to the pet's spell book. This method does not require any parameters
    as it operates on the pet instance itself.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when a pet is summoned
    or created. It's important to ensure that the pet instance is valid before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes.
