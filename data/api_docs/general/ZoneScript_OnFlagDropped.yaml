  class: ZoneScript
  method: OnFlagDropped
  signature: void ZoneScript::OnFlagDropped(const int & flagGuid, Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a flag is dropped in a zone, typically during battlegrounds
    or arena matches.
  description: The OnFlagDropped method is invoked when a player drops a flag in a
    zone, such as during battlegrounds like Arathi Basin or Warsong Gulch. This method
    allows custom scripts to react to the event, potentially triggering game mechanics,
    updating scores, or modifying player states. It provides information about which
    flag was dropped and by which player, enabling developers to implement custom
    behaviors for flag-related events. The method is part of the ZoneScript class,
    which serves as a base for implementing zone-specific logic in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: flagGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the dropped flag object. This value
      uniquely identifies the specific flag instance within the game world.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who dropped the flag. This represents
      the player character that caused the flag to be dropped.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnFlagDropped(const\
      \ int & flagGuid, Player * player) override\n    {\n        // Log that a flag\
      \ was dropped\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s dropped flag with GUID %d\"\
      , player->GetName(), flagGuid);\n        \n        // Example: Reset flag capture\
      \ timer or update game state\n        // Custom logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Example with Flag State Handling
    code: "class ABZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnFlagDropped(const\
      \ int & flagGuid, Player * player) override\n    {\n        // Validate player\
      \ and flag\n        if (!player || !flagGuid)\n            return;\n       \
      \ \n        // Determine which team's flag was dropped\n        uint32 teamId\
      \ = player->GetTeam();\n        \n        // Update game state or send message\
      \ to players\n        if (teamId == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n        {\n            sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_AB_FLAG_DROPPED,\
      \ \"Alliance\", player->GetName());\n        }\n        else\n        {\n  \
      \          sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_AB_FLAG_DROPPED, \"Horde\", player->GetName());\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Trigger additional logic like flag respawn\
      \ timer\n        // Custom logic here\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is typically called from within the core battleground or arena
    systems when a player releases a flag. Developers should ensure that any modifications
    to game state are thread-safe and do not interfere with the core game loop. The
    flagGuid parameter uniquely identifies the flag object, which can be used to retrieve
    additional information about the flag if needed.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to inconsistent game state or
    unexpected behavior during battlegrounds. Avoid performing heavy operations in
    this method as it may block other game events. Ensure that player pointers are
    validated before use to prevent null pointer dereferences.
