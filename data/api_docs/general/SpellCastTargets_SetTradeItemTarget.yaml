  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: SetTradeItemTarget
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetTradeItemTarget(Player * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the trade item target for a spell cast by the player.
  description: The SetTradeItemTarget method configures the SpellCastTargets object
    to use a specific trade item as the target for a spell being cast. This is typically
    used when a player initiates a spell that requires a trade item as its target,
    such as certain enchanting or crafting spells. The method updates the internal
    target tracking state of the spell cast targets to reflect the trade item being
    used. It is important to note that this method assumes the caster has a valid
    trade item selected in their trade window and that the spell being cast supports
    trade item targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is casting the spell and whose trade
      item target will be set. Must not be null and must have an active trade session
      with a valid trade item selected.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Trade Item Target for Enchanting Spell
    code: "void CastEnchantSpell(Player* player)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets targets;\n\
      \    targets.SetTradeItemTarget(player);\n    // Proceed with spell casting\
      \ using the configured targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore spell system
    when processing spells that require trade item targets. Developers should ensure
    that the caster player has an active trade session and a valid trade item selected
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the caster has a valid trade item
    selected may result in incorrect spell targeting or runtime errors. The method
    does not validate whether the spell actually supports trade item targets, so it's
    up to the caller to ensure compatibility.
