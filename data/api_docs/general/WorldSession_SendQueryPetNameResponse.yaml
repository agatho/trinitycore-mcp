  signature: void WorldSession::SendQueryPetNameResponse(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a pet name query response to the client with the specified GUID.
  description: The SendQueryPetNameResponse method is used by the WorldSession class
    to transmit a pet name query result back to the connected client. This method
    is typically invoked when a player attempts to query the name of a pet using a
    specific GUID, which could be related to inspecting a pet or retrieving information
    about a summoned creature. The method does not take any parameters directly but
    uses the provided GUID to construct and send an appropriate response packet to
    the client. It's part of the game's communication protocol for handling pet-related
    data requests.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the pet whose name is being queried.
      This value represents the pet's database ID and is used to locate the corresponding
      pet in the server's data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when querying a pet name
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 petGuid = pet->GetGUID();

      session->SendQueryPetNameResponse(petGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's pet management
    system when a client sends a query request for a pet name. The actual implementation
    may vary based on how the server handles pet data and packet construction, but
    it generally involves sending a specific opcode to the client with the pet's name
    information.
