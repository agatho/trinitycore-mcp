  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: GetTaxiDestination
  signature: uint32 PlayerTaxi::GetTaxiDestination() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the taxi destination node currently set
    for the player.
  description: The GetTaxiDestination method returns the unique identifier (Node ID)
    of the taxi destination that is currently assigned to the player. This value corresponds
    to a specific location in the game's taxi network, typically representing a flight
    path destination. The returned value can be used to determine where the player
    is scheduled to travel next via the taxi system. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with other taxi-related methods to manage and track player travel through the
    game world. The method does not validate whether the destination is reachable
    or active; it simply returns the stored destination node ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the taxi destination
    node. This ID maps directly to a location in the game's taxi network table, typically
    corresponding to a flight point or waypoint in the world.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Taxi Destination
    code: "uint32 destNode = player->GetTaxiDestination();\nif (destNode != 0)\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player's taxi destination node: %u\", destNode);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has no active taxi destination.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Player Has a Taxi Destination
    code: "uint32 dest = player->GetTaxiDestination();\nif (dest != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with taxi-related logic\n    player->AddTaxiPathToQueue(dest);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle case where no destination is set\n    player->SendTaxiMenu();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns the stored taxi destination node ID and does not
    perform any validation or pathfinding. The returned value may be zero if no taxi
    destination has been set, which is a valid state indicating no active flight path.
    This method is thread-safe as it only reads from internal player state without
    modifying it.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned node ID might not correspond to an actual reachable
    location in the game world. Always validate that the destination exists before
    attempting to use it for taxi travel. Also, this value may be reset or changed
    by various game events such as teleportation or flight path changes.
