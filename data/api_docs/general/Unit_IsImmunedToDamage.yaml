    const SpellEffectInfo * spellEffectInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit is immune to damage from a specific spell or caster.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit is immunized against damage caused
    by a specific spell or caster. It evaluates the immunity status based on various
    factors including spell effects, caster influence, and the unit's current state.
    The method is commonly used in game mechanics to prevent certain types of damage
    from affecting units during combat or when they are under specific conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the caster's object (typically a GameObject or Unit) that
      may be influencing the damage. Null values indicate no specific caster.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure defining the spell being evaluated.
      This contains information about the spell's effects and properties.
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellEffectInfo structure defining the specific effect
      of the spell being evaluated. This determines which effect is being checked
      for immunity.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is immune to the specified damage, false otherwise.
    The result depends on the combination of caster, spell, and effect parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsImmunedToDamage(nullptr, spellInfo, spellEffectInfo)) {\n \
      \   // Unit is immune to damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsImmunedToDamage(caster,\
      \ spellInfo, spellEffectInfo)) {\n    // Handle immunity logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other damage-related methods
    to determine whether a unit should receive or avoid damage during combat. It's
    important to note that immunity can be conditional and depends on the specific
    spell, caster, and effect being evaluated.
  warnings: The method may return false even if a unit has immunity due to specific
    conditions or effects not being properly handled. Care must be taken when using
    this method in conjunction with other damage calculations.
