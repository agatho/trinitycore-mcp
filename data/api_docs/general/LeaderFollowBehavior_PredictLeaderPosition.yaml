  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: PredictLeaderPosition
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::PredictLeaderPosition(Player * leader, float
    timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of the leader player based on their movement
    trajectory and a specified time ahead.
  description: The PredictLeaderPosition method calculates where the leader player
    will be located at a given time in the future, taking into account their current
    movement direction, speed, and any ongoing actions that might affect their position.
    This functionality is primarily used in AI behaviors for followers to determine
    optimal positioning or pathing when following a leader. The method returns an
    integer value representing the prediction result status, which can indicate success,
    failure, or other specific conditions related to the prediction process. It's
    commonly employed in group mechanics such as raid coordination, escort quests,
    or any scenario where NPCs or players need to maintain formation or follow a moving
    target.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader whose future
      position is being predicted. Must not be null.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: Floating-point value indicating how many seconds ahead in time to
      predict the leader's position. Should be a positive value; negative values may
      lead to undefined behavior.
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the outcome of the prediction:

    - 0: Success, valid position was predicted

    - Non-zero: Failure or error condition (specific codes depend on internal implementation)

    May return -1 if leader is invalid or null, or other negative values for different
    failure states'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to predict leader's future position
    code: "Player* leader = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nfloat timeAhead =\
      \ 2.0f; // Predict 2 seconds ahead\nint result = behavior->PredictLeaderPosition(leader,\
      \ timeAhead);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Position prediction successful\n \
      \   // Use predicted coordinates for follower AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using prediction in a follow behavior loop
    code: "void UpdateFollowBehavior() {\n    if (!leader || !follower)\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    float timeAhead = 1.5f;\n    int predictionResult = PredictLeaderPosition(leader,\
      \ timeAhead);\n    \n    if (predictionResult == 0) {\n        // Proceed with\
      \ movement toward predicted position\n        MoveToPredictedPosition();\n \
      \   } else {\n        // Handle failure case - perhaps fallback to current position\n\
      \        MoveToCurrentPosition();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the leader is actively moving and has valid movement
    data. If the leader is stationary or not moving, the prediction may be inaccurate
    or return a failure code. The implementation likely uses physics-based calculations
    including velocity, acceleration, and possibly pathfinding to estimate position.
    Performance-wise, this operation should be lightweight but could become more expensive
    if frequent calls are made with high time-ahead values.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring the leader pointer is valid.
    Passing null or invalid player pointers may cause crashes or undefined behavior.
    The timeAhead parameter must be positive; negative values can lead to incorrect
    predictions or errors. This function should only be called during active gameplay
    scenarios where the leader's movement data is reliable.
