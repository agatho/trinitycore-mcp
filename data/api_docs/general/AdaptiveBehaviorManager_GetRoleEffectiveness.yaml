  method: GetRoleEffectiveness
  signature: float AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetRoleEffectiveness(BotRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effectiveness rating of a specified bot role within
    the adaptive behavior system.
  description: The GetRoleEffectiveness method retrieves a float value representing
    how effectively a given bot role performs in the current adaptive behavior context.
    This value is typically used to determine optimal role assignments for bots in
    group scenarios, such as dungeons or raids. The effectiveness rating may be influenced
    by various factors including player class, gear level, encounter type, and current
    combat situation. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only
    in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the effectiveness of the
    specified bot role. A value of 1.0 indicates maximum effectiveness, while 0.0
    indicates no effectiveness. Values in between represent varying degrees of performance
    capability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float effectiveness = manager.GetRoleEffectiveness(BotRole::TANK);

      // Returns a float value indicating how effective the tank role is for this
      bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Effectiveness Comparison
    code: "float healerEffectiveness = manager.GetRoleEffectiveness(BotRole::HEALER);\n\
      float dpsEffectiveness = manager.GetRoleEffectiveness(BotRole::DPS);\nif (healerEffectiveness\
      \ > dpsEffectiveness)\n{\n    // Assign healer role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal adaptive behavior calculations that may be
    updated dynamically during gameplay. The returned values are not guaranteed to
    be consistent across different encounters or sessions without explicit reset of
    the adaptive system.
  warnings: The method assumes valid BotRole enum values; passing invalid enum values
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect effectiveness ratings.
