  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::SpawnBot(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a new bot instance using the provided request identifier.
  description: The SpawnBot method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    new bot within the TrinityCore environment. It takes a request identifier as input
    which determines the configuration and behavior of the spawned bot. The method
    handles the allocation of necessary resources, setting up the bot's initial state,
    and integrating it into the game world. This function typically operates within
    the context of a bot management system where bots are dynamically created based
    on player requests or system triggers. The spawning process may involve checking
    for available resources, validating the request parameters, and ensuring proper
    synchronization with the game server state.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies the bot configuration to be
      used for spawning. This value typically corresponds to a predefined bot template
      or profile in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and integrated into the
    game world, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate resource constraints,
    invalid request parameters, or system errors during the spawning process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nint requestId = 12345;\nbool success = spawner.SpawnBot(requestId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n    printf(\"Bot spawned successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to spawn bot\n    printf(\"Failed to spawn bot\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nint requestId = 67890;\nif (spawner.SpawnBot(requestId))\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Bot with ID %d has been created\\n\", requestId);\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Could not create bot with ID %d\\n\", requestId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from a context where the game server state is
    properly initialized and synchronized. The request parameter must correspond to
    a valid bot configuration that exists in the system's database or configuration
    files. Consider performance implications when spawning multiple bots simultaneously,
    as each spawn operation may require resource allocation and synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid request ID may result in undefined
    behavior or system errors. Ensure that all required bot configurations are loaded
    before attempting to spawn bots. This method should not be called from within
    a critical section or high-frequency loop without proper locking mechanisms.
