documentation:
  brief: Creates a new object instance using the provided GUID
  description: The _Create method initializes a new object instance within the game
    world using the specified ObjectGuid. This method is typically used to instantiate
    objects such as players, creatures, or GameObjects when they are created or spawned
    in the world. The method ensures that the object's unique identifier is properly
    set and that the object is correctly registered in the game world's object manager.
    It serves as a foundational method for object creation and is often invoked during
    the initialization phase of game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The ObjectGuid representing the unique identifier of the object to
      be created. This GUID must be valid and should correspond to a specific type
      of object (player, creature, gameobject, etc.)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Creation
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->_Create(guid);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Creature Object Creation
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->_Create(guid);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the object is being initialized for
    the first time. It is not meant to be used for re-creating objects that already
    exist in the world. The method may involve internal registration with the ObjectManager
    and requires proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already created object can lead to memory leaks
    or duplicate object creation. Ensure that the GUID is valid and that the object
    type matches the intended use case before calling this method.
