  method: ProcessEvent
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::ProcessEvent(const LifecycleEventInfo & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a lifecycle event for bot management within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The ProcessEvent method handles various lifecycle events related to
    bot management in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server. It is responsible for
    executing appropriate actions based on the type of lifecycle event received, such
    as initializing, updating, or cleaning up bot instances. This method integrates
    with the broader bot lifecycle management system to ensure proper coordination
    and state transitions for automated player characters (bots). The method operates
    synchronously and is typically invoked by the core game loop or event handlers
    when bot-related events occur.
  parameters:
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Contains information about the lifecycle event to be processed, including
      event type, associated data, and contextual details required for handling the
      specific event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Processing a Bot Initialization Event
    code: 'LifecycleEventInfo initEvent;

      initEvent.type = LifecycleEventType::BOT_INIT;

      initEvent.botId = 12345;

      botLifecycleMgr.ProcessEvent(initEvent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game thread and should
    not be invoked concurrently. It relies on internal state tracking for bots, so
    calling it without proper initialization may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that eventInfo contains valid data before calling this method;
    invalid or incomplete event information can cause unexpected behavior or crashes
    in the bot management system.
