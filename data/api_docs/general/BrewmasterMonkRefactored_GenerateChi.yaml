  class: BrewmasterMonkRefactored
  method: GenerateChi
  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::GenerateChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates chi for the Brewmaster Monk character based on specified amount.
  description: The GenerateChi method is responsible for increasing the chi resource
    of a Brewmaster Monk character by a given amount. This method typically corresponds
    to abilities or effects that restore or generate chi, such as certain talents,
    items, or passive abilities. The implementation likely updates internal character
    state variables related to chi storage and may trigger visual or auditory feedback
    to the player. This method does not directly consume or spend chi but rather adds
    to the existing chi pool up to the maximum allowed by the character's current
    level and equipment.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi to generate for the Brewmaster Monk. Must be
      a non-negative integer value representing the amount of chi to add to the character's
      current chi pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Generation
    code: 'BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monk = ...;

      monk->GenerateChi(5);

      // Adds 5 chi to the monk''s current chi pool.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Chi from Ability Effect
    code: "void OnUseAbility() {\n    BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monk = GetBrewmasterMonk();\n\
      \    if (monk) {\n        uint32 chiAmount = 10;\n        monk->GenerateChi(chiAmount);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only on valid Brewmaster Monk instances. The
    actual chi generation logic may involve checks against maximum chi limits and
    potential cooldowns or resource constraints. Ensure that the amount parameter
    is validated before calling to prevent invalid values.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value for 'amount' could lead to undefined
    behavior if not handled properly in the implementation. It's recommended to validate
    input parameters to ensure they are non-negative integers.
