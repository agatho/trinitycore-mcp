documentation:
  brief: Removes the player from their current group, effectively ending their participation
    in the group.
  description: This method uninvites the player from their current group, which means
    they will no longer be part of any group that they were previously a member of.
    The player will be removed from the group's roster and will become a solo player.
    This action typically occurs when a player leaves a group or when a group is disbanded.
    The method does not return any value as it is void, and it only affects the player's
    group membership status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->UninviteFromGroup();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player leaves a group or when the
    group is being disbanded. It does not perform any checks for whether the player
    is actually in a group, and it simply removes them from the group. The method
    may be used in conjunction with other methods like Group::RemoveMember to ensure
    proper group management.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly unless you are certain that
    the player is part of a group. Calling this method on a player who is not in a
    group can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in group management.
