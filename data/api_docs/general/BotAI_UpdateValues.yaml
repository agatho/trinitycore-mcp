  class: BotAI
  method: UpdateValues
  signature: void BotAI::UpdateValues(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal AI values and states for the bot based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateValues method is responsible for processing and updating
    the internal state variables of a BotAI instance. It typically handles time-based
    calculations, state transitions, and other periodic updates required for the bot's
    artificial intelligence behavior. This method is usually called from the main
    game loop at regular intervals, using the provided diff parameter to determine
    how much time has passed since the last update. The implementation may include
    logic for decision making, pathfinding updates, target selection, or other AI-related
    computations that depend on elapsed time.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last call to this method.
      Used to calculate time-based AI behaviors and state transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all active bots\n\
      \    for (auto& bot : m_bots)\n    {\n        if (bot->IsAlive())\n        {\n\
      \            bot->GetAI()->UpdateValues(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot AI Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateValues(uint32 diff)\n{\n    m_updateTimer += diff;\n\
      \    \n    if (m_updateTimer >= UPDATE_INTERVAL)\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ AI calculations\n        UpdateCombatState();\n        UpdateMovement();\n\
      \        UpdateTargeting();\n        \n        m_updateTimer = 0;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper AI behavior. The diff parameter is crucial for maintaining consistent
    timing across different system performance conditions. Implementations may vary
    between different bot types, but all should respect the time-based nature of the
    update process.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to inconsistent AI behavior
    or performance issues. Never call this method with a negative value for diff as
    it may cause undefined behavior in time-dependent calculations.
