documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the evoker's position for casting empowered spells by evaluating
    spell range and target proximity.
  description: The OptimizePositionForEmpoweredSpells method adjusts the evoker's
    movement and positioning to maximize the effectiveness of empowered spells. This
    method evaluates the current distance to targets, checks if the evoker is within
    optimal casting range for empowered abilities, and may trigger movement adjustments
    or spell selection changes. It is typically called during AI decision-making processes
    when empowered spells are considered for casting. The behavior ensures that empowered
    spells are cast with maximum potential impact by positioning the evoker appropriately
    relative to targets.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizePositionForEmpoweredSpells();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the evoker's advanced AI behavior system and should
    only be called when the evoker has empowered spells available. It may modify the
    evoker's movement state or target selection internally, so calling it outside
    of appropriate contexts could lead to unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from spell cast logic as it may interfere
    with the normal spell casting sequence. The method assumes that the evoker has
    valid targets and is in a combat state.
