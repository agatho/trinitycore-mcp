  signature: bool ExampleManager::IsProcessingTask() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the manager is currently processing a task.
  description: The IsProcessingTask method determines if the ExampleManager instance
    is currently engaged in processing a task. This method typically returns true
    when an asynchronous operation or background job is active, and false when no
    task is being processed. The implementation likely uses a flag or atomic variable
    to track the processing state. This check is useful for preventing concurrent
    access issues or ensuring proper sequencing of operations within the manager's
    lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the manager is currently processing a task, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check task status
    code: "if (exampleManager.IsProcessingTask()) {\n    // Handle case where task\
      \ is in progress\n    sLog->outString(\"Task is currently being processed.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Proceed with new task or operation\n    exampleManager.StartNewTask();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for thread safety and state management. It
    may be implemented using atomic variables or mutexes depending on the internal
    design of ExampleManager.
