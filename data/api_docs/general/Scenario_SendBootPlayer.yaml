  signature: void Scenario::SendBootPlayer(const int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a boot player message to the specified player in the scenario.
  description: The SendBootPlayer method is used to notify a specific player within
    a scenario that they are being booted or removed from the scenario instance. This
    typically occurs when a player's session ends, they are kicked, or the scenario
    is concluding. The method likely sends a network packet to the client instructing
    it to remove the player from the scenario environment. It is commonly used during
    scenario cleanup or termination processes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the scenario context. This value identifies which specific player
      will receive the boot notification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      scenario->SendBootPlayer(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Player GUID from ObjectAccessor
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nif (player)\n{\n    int guid = static_cast<int>(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    scenario->SendBootPlayer(&guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a client-side event that removes the player from
    the scenario UI and resets their scenario-related state. It may also be used in
    conjunction with other cleanup methods to properly terminate the player's scenario
    session.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the scenario, otherwise the method might not behave as expected or could
    cause errors.
