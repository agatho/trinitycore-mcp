  method: ConditionsSatisfied
  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::ConditionsSatisfied(const Criteria * criteria,
    Player * referencePlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether all conditions associated with a criteria are satisfied
    by the reference player.
  description: The ConditionsSatisfied method checks if all prerequisite conditions
    for a given criteria are met by the specified player. This method is typically
    used within the context of achievement systems or quest progress tracking in TrinityCore.
    It evaluates the logical state of various criteria conditions such as item possession,
    quest completion, or player level requirements. The method returns true only if
    every condition in the criteria's condition list is satisfied by the reference
    player. This function plays a critical role in determining whether a player has
    fulfilled all requirements to earn an achievement or complete a quest objective.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to the Criteria object containing the conditions to be evaluated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose conditions are being checked against
      the criteria. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions in the criteria are satisfied by the reference
    player, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for checking achievement criteria
    code: "Criteria* myCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nPlayer* player\
      \ = session->GetPlayer();\nif (criteriaHandler->ConditionsSatisfied(myCriteria,\
      \ player)) {\n    // Player meets all criteria conditions\n    // Proceed with\
      \ achievement reward logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in quest completion validation
    code: "void ValidateQuestCompletion(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    Criteria*\
      \ questCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteriaForQuest(questId);\n    if (questCriteria\
      \ && criteriaHandler->ConditionsSatisfied(questCriteria, player)) {\n      \
      \  // Quest can be completed\n        player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep evaluation of all conditions in the criteria
    hierarchy. It may involve database lookups or complex state checks depending on
    the condition types. The method assumes that both input parameters are valid and
    not null, as null pointer dereferences could occur if these preconditions are
    not met.
  warnings: Ensure that the criteria object passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method. Passing a null criteria pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that condition evaluation might
    involve expensive operations like database queries, so use this method judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths.
