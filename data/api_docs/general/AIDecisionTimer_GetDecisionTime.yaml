  signature: uint64_t AIDecisionTimer::GetDecisionTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the decision time value stored in the AI timer instance.
  description: The GetDecisionTime method returns the internal timestamp value that
    represents when an AI decision was last made or is scheduled to be made. This
    value is typically used in conjunction with game tick timing to determine if enough
    time has passed for the AI to make a new decision. The returned value is a uint64_t
    representing milliseconds since epoch, which allows for precise timing comparisons
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the decision time in milliseconds since Unix
    epoch. This timestamp indicates when the AI last made a decision or when it is
    expected to make the next one, depending on how the timer was initialized and
    updated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer;

      timer.SetDecisionTime(1234567890ULL); // Set a sample decision time

      uint64_t decisionTime = timer.GetDecisionTime(); // Retrieve the stored value

      printf("Decision time: %llu\n", decisionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Timing Check Example
    code: "AIDecisionTimer aiTimer;\nuint64_t currentTime = getMSTime(); // Assume\
      \ this function returns current time in ms\nif (currentTime >= aiTimer.GetDecisionTime())\
      \ {\n    // AI can make a new decision\n    aiTimer.SetDecisionTime(currentTime\
      \ + 1000); // Schedule next decision in 1 second\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal timer value has been properly initialized.
    If called before any decision time is set, it will return zero or an undefined
    value depending on initialization behavior. The returned timestamp should be compared
    against current game time using appropriate timing functions to determine AI readiness.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing timestamps from different sources; ensure all
    time values are in the same units (milliseconds since epoch) for accurate comparisons.
    Using this method without proper initialization may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect decision-making logic.
