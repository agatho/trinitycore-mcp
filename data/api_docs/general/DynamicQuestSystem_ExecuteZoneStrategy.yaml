  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ExecuteZoneStrategy
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteZoneStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the zone strategy for a given player bot, determining quest actions
    based on current zone conditions.
  description: The ExecuteZoneStrategy method is responsible for evaluating and applying
    zone-specific quest logic to a player bot. It analyzes the current zone environment,
    available quests, and bot state to determine appropriate quest-related actions
    such as accepting quests, turning in quests, or navigating to quest locations.
    This method typically integrates with the dynamic quest system's core decision-making
    process, ensuring that bots adapt their behavior based on the geographical context
    of their current location. The method operates synchronously and is designed to
    be called during bot update cycles or when zone transitions occur.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the zone
      strategy should be executed. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n\
      \    {\n        sDynamicQuestSystem->ExecuteZoneStrategy(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with zone transition handling
    code: "void Player::OnMapChanged()\n{\n    if (IsBot())\n    {\n        sDynamicQuestSystem->ExecuteZoneStrategy(this);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's zone data is properly initialized and
    up-to-date. It may modify the bot's quest state, target selection, and movement
    behavior. The implementation likely involves checking quest availability, evaluating
    quest requirements, and updating the bot's internal quest tracking state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual bot instance. Calling this method on a non-bot player may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect quest handling.
