  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: BeginWorldEntry
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::BeginWorldEntry(EntryCallback callback)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a world entry process for a bot, invoking a callback upon completion.
  description: The BeginWorldEntry method starts the process of entering the game
    world for a bot instance. It typically handles initialization tasks such as setting
    up player data, loading necessary resources, and preparing the bot for interaction
    within the game environment. The method accepts an EntryCallback function that
    will be executed once the entry process is complete. This callback can be used
    to perform post-entry actions like character selection, zone loading, or starting
    AI behavior. The method returns true if the entry process was successfully initiated,
    or false if it failed due to invalid state or system constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the world entry process was successfully initiated; false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the bot is already in the world,
    the entry process is already active, or there are insufficient resources to begin
    the process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot World Entry
    code: "BotWorldEntry botEntry;\nbool success = botEntry.BeginWorldEntry([]() {\n\
      \    // Callback executed after successful world entry\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot successfully entered the world\");\n});\nif (success) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      World entry initiated\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initiate\
      \ world entry\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with bot management systems
    within TrinityCore. The EntryCallback may be executed on a different thread depending
    on the implementation, so thread safety should be considered when accessing shared
    resources from within the callback.
  warnings: Calling BeginWorldEntry multiple times without proper state checking may
    lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that any existing entry process
    is completed before initiating a new one.
