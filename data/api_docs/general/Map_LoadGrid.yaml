api:
  class: Map
  method: LoadGrid
  signature: void Map::LoadGrid(float x, float y)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a grid cell at the specified coordinates for the map.
  description: The LoadGrid method is responsible for loading a specific grid cell
    at the given coordinates (x, y) on the map. This method ensures that all objects
    within the grid cell are properly initialized and ready for interaction. It typically
    handles the loading of grid-based data such as creatures, game objects, and other
    entities that may exist within the specified area. The method is crucial for maintaining
    proper game state and ensuring that the map's grid system functions correctly
    during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid cell to load. This represents the horizontal
      position in the world coordinate system.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid cell to load. This represents the vertical
      position in the world coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      map->LoadGrid(100.0f, 200.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    moves into a new grid area. It may involve loading data from database or memory
    cache, and it's important to note that this method does not directly load all
    objects in the map but rather focuses on a specific grid cell. Performance considerations
    include potential delays if large amounts of data need to be loaded.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code without understanding
    of its implications. Calling it incorrectly can lead to memory issues or inconsistent
    game state. It's recommended that developers use the appropriate methods provided
    by the game engine rather than calling this directly.
