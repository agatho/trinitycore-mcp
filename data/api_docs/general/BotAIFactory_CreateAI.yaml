documentation:
  brief: Initializes and assigns an AI instance to a bot player
  description: The CreateAI method is responsible for creating and initializing an
    AI behavior system for a given bot player. It sets up the necessary AI components,
    registers the bot with the AI subsystem, and prepares it for autonomous gameplay.
    This method typically gets invoked when a bot is added to the game world or when
    its AI needs to be reinitialized. The method ensures that the bot has proper AI
    functionality enabled, allowing it to perform actions such as movement, combat
    behavior, and quest handling according to predefined AI rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful initialization, while
    non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player
    reference, insufficient resources, or AI subsystem failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = BotAIFactory::CreateAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the bot\n    printf(\"Bot AI initialized successfully\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle AI creation failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize\
      \ bot AI with error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when a bot's
    AI needs to be reset. The implementation likely involves allocating memory for
    AI structures, setting up behavior trees or state machines, and registering the
    bot with the game's AI manager. It's important to ensure that the Player pointer
    passed to this method is valid and represents an actual bot character, not a regular
    player.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or with a null player pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that all necessary
    prerequisites for AI creation are met, such as available memory and proper game
    state. Developers should verify the player type before calling this method to
    avoid unexpected issues.
