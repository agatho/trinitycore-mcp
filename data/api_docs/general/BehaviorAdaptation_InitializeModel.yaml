  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: InitializeModel
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::InitializeModel(BotLearningModel * model)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the behavior adaptation model with the provided bot learning
    model instance.
  description: The InitializeModel method sets up and prepares a BehaviorAdaptation
    object for use with a specified BotLearningModel. This method typically configures
    internal data structures, initializes parameters, and establishes the necessary
    context for the behavior adaptation logic to function correctly. It is usually
    called during the initialization phase of an AI bot or behavior system within
    TrinityCore's framework. The method expects a valid BotLearningModel pointer as
    input, which contains the learning parameters and configurations needed for the
    behavior adaptation process.
  parameters:
  - name: model
    description: Pointer to a BotLearningModel instance that provides the learning
      configuration and parameters for behavior adaptation. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'BotLearningModel* learningModel = new BotLearningModel();

      BehaviorAdaptation behaviorAdapt;

      behaviorAdapt.InitializeModel(learningModel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Pre-configured Model
    code: "BotLearningModel* model = GetPreconfiguredBotModel();\nif (model)\n{\n\
      \    BehaviorAdaptation* adaptation = new BehaviorAdaptation();\n    adaptation->InitializeModel(model);\n\
      \    // Proceed with behavior adaptation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifetime, typically
    during construction or setup. The provided BotLearningModel must remain valid
    for the duration of the BehaviorAdaptation object's usage. Ensure proper memory
    management to avoid dangling pointers.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate that the model parameter is not null before calling
    InitializeModel.
