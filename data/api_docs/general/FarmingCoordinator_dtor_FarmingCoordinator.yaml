  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::~FarmingCoordinator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FarmingCoordinator instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the FarmingCoordinator class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the coordinator.
    This method ensures that when a FarmingCoordinator object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted, all internal data structures, such as farming task lists,
    resource caches, or temporary allocations, are properly deallocated to prevent
    memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    destructor would typically be invoked during world shutdown, player logout, or
    when a farming module is disabled. It is important that this method does not throw
    exceptions and performs all cleanup operations in a predictable manner.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FarmingCoordinator
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    FarmingCoordinator coordinator;\n    // ...\
      \ use coordinator ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of FarmingCoordinator pointer
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator* coord = new FarmingCoordinator();

      // ... use coord ...

      delete coord; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be noexcept to avoid potential issues during stack
    unwinding. It is recommended that derived classes also implement proper destructors
    if they manage additional resources.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor directly unless you are managing memory
    manually. The destructor should only be invoked as part of normal object lifecycle
    management.
