  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateClientActor
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClientActor(uint16 ownerType, uint16
    ownerId, uint32 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a unique ObjectGuid for a client actor using specified
    owner type, owner ID, and counter values.
  description: The CreateClientActor method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for client-side actors within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically used when creating game entities such as players, NPCs, or objects
    that need to be uniquely identified on the client side. The generated GUID incorporates
    the provided owner type and ID to establish hierarchical relationships, while
    the counter ensures uniqueness among multiple instances of the same owner type.
    The resulting ObjectGuid can then be used to reference these actors throughout
    the game's networking and object management systems.
  parameters:
  - name: ownerType
    description: Specifies the type of the entity that owns this actor (e.g., player,
      creature, gameobject). This value determines how the GUID is interpreted within
      the game's object hierarchy.
  - name: ownerId
    description: The unique identifier of the owner entity. This ID is combined with
      the ownerType to create a distinct namespace for actor GUIDs.
  - name: counter
    description: A sequential counter value used to ensure uniqueness among multiple
      actors owned by the same entity. This value increments for each new actor created
      under the same owner.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies the client actor
    within the game world. The GUID is constructed using the provided parameters and
    follows TrinityCore's standard GUID formatting conventions.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Player Actor GUID
    code: ObjectGuid playerActorGuid = guidFactory.CreateClientActor(1, 12345, 1);
      // Creates a GUID for a player actor with owner ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Creature Actors
    code: 'ObjectGuid creature1 = guidFactory.CreateClientActor(2, 67890, 1); // First
      creature owned by entity 67890

      ObjectGuid creature2 = guidFactory.CreateClientActor(2, 67890, 2); // Second
      creature owned by entity 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with object spawning and networking
    systems. The GUIDs generated are designed to be compatible with TrinityCore's
    internal object tracking mechanisms and should not be manually constructed or
    modified. The counter parameter must be managed carefully to avoid collisions
    when creating multiple actors.
  warnings: Do not reuse counter values for the same ownerType and ownerId combination,
    as this will result in duplicate GUIDs which can cause unpredictable behavior
    in the game world. Ensure that ownerType and ownerId values are valid within the
    context of your specific implementation.
