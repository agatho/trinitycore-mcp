  class: WalkInData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void WalkInData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for a walk-in object into a ByteBuffer for transmission
    to players.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a WalkInData
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to player clients.
    This method is typically invoked when sending initial object state information
    to players who are about to interact with or view the walk-in data. The serialization
    process includes relevant fields such as GUID, position, orientation, and other
    object-specific attributes that define how the walk-in appears and behaves in
    the game world. The owner and receiver parameters allow for conditional serialization
    based on player permissions or visibility rules, ensuring that only appropriate
    data is sent to each client.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized creation data will
      be written. This buffer is typically used to construct network packets sent
      to players.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that owns or controls this walk-in data.
      Used for determining ownership-based visibility or permissions during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized data.
      Used for conditional serialization based on player-specific rules or visibility
      settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a packet construction context
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiving player

      WalkInData walkIn;

      walkIn.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore object serialization system and should
    be called during object initialization or update events. It assumes that all necessary
    fields in the WalkInData instance are properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner and receiver parameters are valid pointers to Player
    objects; passing null pointers may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    about performance when serializing large amounts of walk-in data frequently.
