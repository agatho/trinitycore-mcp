  brief: Processes and applies batch updates to quest objectives for all active quests
  description: The BatchObjectiveUpdates method is responsible for efficiently handling
    multiple quest objective progress updates in a single operation. This method typically
    collects all pending objective changes from active quests and applies them together,
    reducing the number of database writes and network packets sent to clients. It
    ensures that quest progress is synchronized correctly across the game world, particularly
    when multiple objectives are updated simultaneously due to player actions or events.
    The method is commonly called during quest completion processing or when handling
    rapid sequence of quest-related events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion Flow
    code: "void Player::CompleteQuest(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // ... quest completion\
      \ logic ...\n    sQuestMgr->BatchObjectiveUpdates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when all objective updates are ready to
    be committed. It's designed for performance optimization and may not immediately
    reflect changes in client UI until the batch is processed. The method assumes
    that all relevant quest data has been properly validated before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper quest completion contexts may lead
    to inconsistent quest states or missing progress updates. Avoid calling it during
    active quest events that might conflict with ongoing objective tracking.
