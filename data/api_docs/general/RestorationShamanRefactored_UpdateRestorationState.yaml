documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state of the restoration shaman class for proper gameplay
    behavior.
  description: The UpdateRestorationState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal state of a restoration shaman class instance. This includes handling
    mana regeneration, spell cooldowns, aura states, and other game mechanics relevant
    to the restoration shaman's role in World of Warcraft. The method ensures that
    all restoration-specific attributes are synchronized with the current game context,
    such as player level, equipped items, buffs, debuffs, and active abilities. It
    typically gets called during game loop updates or when specific events occur that
    affect the shaman's restoration capabilities.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    RestorationShamanRefactored shaman;\n    // ...\
      \ other initialization code ...\n    shaman.UpdateRestorationState();\n    //\
      \ ... continue game loop\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during the game's update cycle, so
    performance optimization is important. It may internally call several other state
    management methods and should be considered a core part of the shaman's AI behavior
    system.
