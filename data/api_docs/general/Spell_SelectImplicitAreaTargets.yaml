  class: Spell
  method: SelectImplicitAreaTargets
  signature: void Spell::SelectImplicitAreaTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,
    const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType, int targetIndex, uint32 effMask)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit area targets for a spell effect based on target type and
    index.
  description: This method determines and selects the appropriate area targets for
    a given spell effect, utilizing the provided target information and index. It
    handles the selection of targets based on various criteria including target types,
    effects, and specific parameters. The method is crucial for proper spell execution
    and target selection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, ensuring that
    spells correctly apply their effects to the intended targets.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the spell effect being processed, including
      its type, level, and other relevant parameters.
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type for the spell effect, indicating
      how targets should be selected (e.g., friendly, hostile, self, etc.).
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Specifies which target index to use when selecting targets, typically
      representing the position of the target within a list or group.
  - name: effMask
    description: A bitmask representing which spell effects are being considered for
      target selection, allowing for selective processing of specific effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitAreaTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex,
      effMask);

      // This selects area targets for a spell effect based on the specified parameters.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitAreaTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex, effMask);

      // This demonstrates how the method might be used in a more complex scenario
      involving multiple effects.'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires careful handling of target types and indices to ensure
    correct spell targeting. It may involve complex logic for determining valid targets
    based on game mechanics, particularly for spells with multiple effects or target
    types. Performance considerations include efficient processing of target selection
    to avoid delays in spell execution.
  warnings: Improper handling of target parameters can lead to incorrect target selection,
    potentially causing spells to miss their intended targets or apply effects incorrectly.
    Care must be taken when using effMask to ensure only the correct effects are processed.
