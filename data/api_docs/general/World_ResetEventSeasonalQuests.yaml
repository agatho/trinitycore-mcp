documentation:
  brief: Resets seasonal quests for a specified event, clearing completed quest data
    and restoring initial state.
  description: The ResetEventSeasonalQuests method is responsible for resetting the
    state of seasonal quests associated with a specific event ID. This function typically
    clears any completed quest flags, resets quest counters, and ensures that players
    can re-engage with seasonal content as if they had never started it. It's commonly
    used during event resets or when seasonal content is updated in the game world.
    The method takes into account the event start time to properly synchronize quest
    states with the current event cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the seasonal event whose quests should be
      reset. This value corresponds to the event entry in the game's database.
  - name: eventStartTime
    description: The timestamp indicating when the event started. Used to determine
      which quest states need to be reset and to ensure proper synchronization with
      the event cycle.
  returns: null

  notes: This method likely iterates through all active seasonal quests associated
    with the given event ID and resets their completion status in the database. It

    state.
