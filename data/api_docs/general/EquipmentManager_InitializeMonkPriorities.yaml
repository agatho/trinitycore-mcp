  signature: void EquipmentManager::InitializeMonkPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the priority order for monk equipment slots based on class-specific
    requirements and gameplay mechanics.
  description: The InitializeMonkPriorities method sets up the default equipment priority
    list for monks within the TrinityCore framework. This method configures which
    inventory slots are prioritized when a monk character is equipped with gear, taking
    into account the unique mechanics of monk classes such as mastery effects, stat
    distributions, and specialization requirements. The initialization process ensures
    that critical monk stats like agility, stamina, and critical strike are properly
    prioritized during equipment management operations. This method is typically invoked
    during player login or class-specific initialization phases to ensure proper gear
    setup for gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    EquipmentManager::InitializeMonkPriorities();\n\
      \    // Additional login logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core equipment management system and should only
    be called during appropriate initialization phases. The priority order established
    by this method affects how gear is evaluated during automatic equipment updates
    and slot swapping operations.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper initialization contexts may lead
    to inconsistent equipment behavior or unexpected stat distributions for monk characters.
