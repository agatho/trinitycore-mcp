  method: ShouldUseAvengingWrath
  signature: bool HolyPaladinRefactored::ShouldUseAvengingWrath(int * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Holy Paladin should use Avenging Wrath based on current
    combat state and group composition.
  description: This method evaluates the optimal timing for using the Avenging Wrath
    ability in a Holy Paladin's rotation. It considers factors such as the player's
    current health, mana levels, threat situation, and group dynamics to determine
    if invoking Avenging Wrath would be beneficial. The method returns true when it
    is advantageous to use the ability, and false otherwise. In a group context, this
    method may also assess whether the player should delay using Avenging Wrath to
    avoid disrupting group cooldowns or resource management strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Avenging Wrath should be used immediately based on current
    conditions; returns false if it is not advisable to use the ability at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (paladin->ShouldUseAvengingWrath()) {\n    paladin->CastSpell(AVENGING_WRATH_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group-Based Decision Making
    code: "int groupStatus = 0;\nif (paladin->ShouldUseAvengingWrath(&groupStatus))\
      \ {\n    // Check group status before casting\n    if (groupStatus == GROUP_STATUS_SAFE)\
      \ {\n        paladin->CastSpell(AVENGING_WRATH_SPELL_ID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Holy Paladin's combat decision-making logic and
    integrates with TrinityCore's AI framework. It may consider external factors such
    as raid composition, encounter phase, and cooldowns of other players in the group.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or during non-combat phases
    where Avenging Wrath has no effect. Improper usage could lead to inefficient resource
    management or missed opportunities for optimal damage output.
