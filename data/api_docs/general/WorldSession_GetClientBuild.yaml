  class: WorldSession
  method: GetClientBuild
  signature: uint32 WorldSession::GetClientBuild() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the client build version associated with the WorldSession.
  description: The GetClientBuild method retrieves the World of Warcraft client build
    number that the session is connected with. This value is typically set during
    the initial login process and represents the specific version of the game client
    that the player is using. The build number is crucial for compatibility checks,
    patch validation, and ensuring that the server and client are running compatible
    versions. It helps TrinityCore determine which features, content, or fixes are
    available to the connected client.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the client's build version number. This number
    corresponds to the specific World of Warcraft patch version (e.g., 12345 for 1.12.1).
  examples:
  - title: Checking Client Build Version
    code: "uint32 build = session->GetClientBuild();\nif (build < 12345)\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle older client version\n    session->SendNotification(\"Your client is\
      \ outdated.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Build Version for Feature Checks
    code: "uint32 build = session->GetClientBuild();\nif (build >= 15595)\n{\n   \
      \ // Enable features available in 3.3.5a or later\n    player->SetCanFly(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The build version is set once during the login handshake and remains constant
    for the duration of the session. It's important to note that this value may not
    always reflect the exact patch level if a client has been modified or if custom
    builds are used.
