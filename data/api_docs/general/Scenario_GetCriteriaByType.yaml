  class: Scenario
  method: GetCriteriaByType
  signature: const int & Scenario::GetCriteriaByType(int type, int asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the criteria ID associated with a specific scenario type and asset.
  description: 'The GetCriteriaByType method is used to fetch the criteria identifier
    linked to a given scenario type and asset within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function plays a crucial role in handling scenario-based achievements and tracking
    progress for players participating in various scenario events. The method takes
    two integer parameters: ''type'' which defines the scenario type, and ''asset''
    which specifies the asset or reward associated with that scenario. It returns
    a constant reference to an integer representing the criteria ID, allowing for
    efficient access without copying the value.'
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer value indicating the scenario type. This typically corresponds
      to predefined scenario types defined in the game's scenario system.
  - name: asset
    description: An integer value representing the asset or reward identifier associated
      with the specified scenario type. This may refer to rewards, objectives, or
      other scenario-specific assets.
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the criteria ID for
    the given scenario type and asset combination. If no matching criteria is found,
    the behavior is undefined and may result in a default or invalid value being returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int criteriaId = scenario.GetCriteriaByType(10, 5); // Retrieves criteria
      ID for scenario type 10 with asset 5
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Return Value in Conditional Logic
    code: "const int& criteriaRef = scenario.GetCriteriaByType(20, 15);\nif (criteriaRef\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Proceed with logic using the criteria ID\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Criteria ID: \" << criteriaRef << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an integer, meaning that modifications
    to the returned value will not affect the internal state of the Scenario object.
    Developers should be aware that the returned reference is only valid while the
    Scenario object remains in scope and has not been modified.
  warnings: Since this method returns a const reference, accessing the returned value
    after the Scenario object has been destroyed or invalidated may lead to undefined
    behavior. Additionally, if no matching criteria exists for the given parameters,
    the result is unpredictable and should be handled carefully.
