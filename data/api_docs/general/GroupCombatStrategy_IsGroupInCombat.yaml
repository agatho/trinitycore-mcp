  signature: bool GroupCombatStrategy::IsGroupInCombat(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's group is currently engaged in combat.
  description: The IsGroupInCombat method checks if any member of the player's current
    group is involved in combat. This includes both direct combat with enemies and
    being in a combat state due to recent damage or aggro. The method evaluates the
    combat status of all group members and returns true if at least one member is
    in combat, otherwise false. This functionality is essential for group-based AI
    decision-making in TrinityCore's bot system, particularly when determining whether
    to engage, disengage, or reposition during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any group member is currently in combat; returns false
    if no group members are in combat or if the player is not in a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group combat status
    code: "if (groupCombatStrategy.IsGroupInCombat(ai)) {\n    // Group is in combat,\
      \ take defensive action\n    ai->SetNextAction(Action::DEFEND);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Group is not in combat, proceed with normal behavior\n    ai->SetNextAction(Action::FOLLOW);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of group members' combat
    status. It may not immediately reflect changes in combat state if there are delays
    in AI update cycles. The implementation assumes that BotAI provides access to
    current group information and member states.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance passed to this method is properly initialized
    and has a valid group context. Calling this method outside of a proper group context
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
