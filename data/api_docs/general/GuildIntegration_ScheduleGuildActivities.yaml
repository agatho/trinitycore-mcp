  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ScheduleGuildActivities
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ScheduleGuildActivities(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules guild activities for a player, handling activity registration and
    timing within the guild integration system.
  description: The ScheduleGuildActivities method is responsible for organizing and
    scheduling various guild-related activities for a specified player. This function
    likely manages the coordination of events such as guild raids, quests, or social
    gatherings by integrating with the core TrinityCore framework's guild management
    systems. It handles the registration of player participation in upcoming guild
    activities, ensuring proper timing and synchronization with in-game events. The
    method may also validate player eligibility and update internal activity tracking
    structures. This function is typically invoked when a player expresses interest
    in participating in guild activities or when the system needs to proactively schedule
    upcoming events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the TrinityCore system. This parameter identifies which player's
      guild activities are being scheduled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Activity Scheduling
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ScheduleGuildActivities(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Activities for Multiple Players
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\n\
      for (int playerId : playerIds) {\n    guildInt.ScheduleGuildActivities(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's internal guild management
    systems and may require the player to be currently logged in. The function may
    perform database operations to persist activity scheduling information. It is
    recommended to ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active
    player before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or invalid player ID could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the player identifier corresponds to an actual logged-in
    character in the game world. This function may block execution during database
    operations, so consider performance implications when scheduling activities for
    many players simultaneously.
