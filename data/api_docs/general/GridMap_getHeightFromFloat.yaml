  class: GridMap
  method: getHeightFromFloat
  signature: float GridMap::getHeightFromFloat(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the height value at the specified coordinates from the grid map.
  description: The getHeightFromFloat method is used to obtain the elevation height
    at a given (x, y) coordinate on the grid map. This method is essential for determining
    terrain height in World of Warcraft's game world, particularly for character movement,
    collision detection, and object placement. The method performs interpolation between
    height values stored in the grid map's height field to provide a precise height
    value even when the requested coordinates do not align exactly with grid points.
    It assumes that the input coordinates are within the valid bounds of the grid
    map.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate on the grid map for which to retrieve the height
      value. This is typically a floating-point number representing the horizontal
      position in game world coordinates.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate on the grid map for which to retrieve the height
      value. This is typically a floating-point number representing the vertical position
      in game world coordinates.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the height at the specified (x, y) coordinates.
    The returned value corresponds to the elevation of the terrain at that point in
    the game world. If the coordinates are outside the valid grid map bounds, behavior
    is undefined and may result in invalid or unexpected values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get terrain height
    code: 'float height = gridMap->getHeightFromFloat(100.5f, 200.3f);

      // Returns the height value at coordinates (100.5, 200.3) on the grid map'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using height for character positioning
    code: 'float playerX = 1234.5f;

      float playerY = 6789.2f;

      float groundHeight = gridMap->getHeightFromFloat(playerX, playerY);

      // Use groundHeight to position a character at the correct elevation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs bilinear interpolation between four surrounding height
    values to compute the result. The implementation assumes that the grid map has
    been properly initialized and loaded with height data. Performance is generally
    good for single queries, but repeated calls in tight loops should be optimized
    by caching results or using spatial indexing.
  warnings: Calling this method with coordinates outside the valid grid map bounds
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that coordinate validation
    is performed before calling this method if input coordinates are not guaranteed
    to be within bounds. The method does not perform any bounds checking internally.
