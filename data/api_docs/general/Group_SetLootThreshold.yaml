  method: SetLootThreshold
  signature: void Group::SetLootThreshold(int threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot threshold for the group, determining the minimum quality level
    of items that will be looted by group members.
  description: The SetLootThreshold method configures the minimum item quality level
    required for items to be distributed among group members. This setting affects
    how loot is awarded in a group context, with higher thresholds requiring better
    quality items before they are considered for distribution. The threshold value
    typically corresponds to standard item quality levels such as Poor (0), Common
    (1), Uncommon (2), Rare (3), Epic (4), and Legendary (5). When an item's quality
    meets or exceeds the set threshold, it becomes eligible for group loot distribution
    according to the group's loot rules. This method is commonly used in raid environments
    where specific loot rules are enforced based on item rarity.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: The minimum quality level required for items to be looted by group
      members. Valid values typically range from 0 (Poor) to 5 (Legendary), though
      exact values may depend on game version and configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set loot threshold to Rare quality
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLootThreshold(3);\
      \ // Rare items or better\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure loot threshold for a raid group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    // Set to Epic quality for raid loot\n    raidGroup->SetLootThreshold(4);\n\
      \    // Notify players of new loot rules\n    raidGroup->SendUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the group's loot settings and may affect how
    loot is distributed to all members. The change takes effect immediately for subsequent
    loot rolls. This functionality is typically used in raid environments where specific
    loot rules are enforced based on item rarity or progression requirements.
  warnings: Setting a very high threshold (e.g., Legendary) may result in no items
    being distributed if the group encounters only lower-quality loot. Ensure that
    the threshold value aligns with the expected loot quality in the current encounter
    to avoid confusion among group members.
