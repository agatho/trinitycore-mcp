documentation:
  brief: Adds a new suggestion ticket to the support management system for tracking
    and processing player feedback.
  description: The AddTicket method is responsible for inserting a new SuggestionTicket
    object into the support management system. This method handles the storage and
    registration of player-provided suggestions or feedback within the TrinityCore
    framework. The ticket is typically created by players through in-game interfaces
    or submission forms, and this method ensures proper handling and persistence of
    that data. It integrates with the broader support ticketing infrastructure to
    maintain organized records of player interactions and feedback for staff review
    and action.
  parameters:
  - name: ticket
    description: Pointer to the SuggestionTicket object that represents the player's
      feedback or suggestion to be added to the system. This parameter must not be
      null, as passing a null pointer would likely result in undefined behavior or
      crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ticket Addition
    code: 'SuggestionTicket* newTicket = new SuggestionTicket();

      newTicket->SetPlayerGUID(12345);

      newTicket->SetContent("Great game, but could use more quests!");

      SupportMgr::instance()->AddTicket(newTicket);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Ticket with Validation
    code: "if (ticket != nullptr && !ticket->GetContent().empty()) {\n    SupportMgr::instance()->AddTicket(ticket);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid ticket\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of the ticket data before
    adding it to the system. It may also trigger database operations or event notifications
    upon successful addition. The method should be called from a context where the
    ticket object is properly initialized and contains valid data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the ticket parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that all ticket fields are properly initialized
    before calling this method. This method may have performance implications if called
    frequently in rapid succession without batching operations.
