  class: SmartAreaTriggerAI
  method: SetTimedActionList
  signature: void SmartAreaTriggerAI::SetTimedActionList(SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32
    entry, Unit * invoker)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and assigns a timed action list to the area trigger AI based
    on provided script holder and entry.
  description: The SetTimedActionList method configures the SmartAreaTriggerAI instance
    to execute a specific set of timed actions defined by a SmartScriptHolder. This
    method is typically invoked during the initialization or activation phase of an
    area trigger, allowing the AI to respond to events with pre-defined scripted behaviors.
    The entry parameter specifies which script entry to use from the database, while
    the invoker parameter provides context about the unit that triggered the action.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the AI
    instance to prepare it for timed event execution.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing the script data
      and actions to be executed.
  - name: entry
    description: Unique identifier for the script entry in the database that defines
      the timed action list to be used.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that triggered this area trigger, providing
      context for script execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Activation
    code: "void OnAreaTrigger(Unit* unit) {\n    if (unit && unit->IsPlayer()) {\n\
      \        SmartScriptHolder holder;\n        // Assume holder is populated with\
      \ script data\n        SetTimedActionList(holder, 12345, unit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the SmartAreaTriggerAI has been properly
    initialized and when valid script data is available. It directly affects the AI's
    behavior and must be used carefully to avoid conflicts with existing timed actions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the SmartScriptHolder
    or invalid entry values may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that
    the invoker parameter is not null before calling.
