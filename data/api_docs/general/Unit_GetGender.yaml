documentation:
  brief: Returns the gender of the unit as an integer value.
  description: The GetGender method retrieves the gender information of a Unit object,
    which can be used to determine whether the unit is male, female, or neutral. This
    method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for character
    and creature gender determination. The returned value typically corresponds to
    the standard WoW gender enum values where 0 represents male, 1 represents female,
    and 2 represents neutral. This information is crucial for various gameplay mechanics
    including character customization, faction interactions, and NPC dialogue behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the gender of the unit. Possible
    values are 0 (male), 1 (female), or 2 (neutral). The method returns 0 if the unit
    is male, 1 if female, and 2 if neutral. No null or error conditions are expected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int gender = unit->GetGender();\nif (gender == 0)\n{\n    // Unit is male\n\
      }\nelse if (gender == 1)\n{\n    // Unit is female\n}\nelse if (gender == 2)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is neutral\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for implementation. It simply returns the gender value stored in the unit's internal
    data structure without performing any complex operations or calculations.
  warnings: No significant warnings. The method should be used carefully when dealing
    with different gendered NPCs or players, as incorrect handling may lead to unexpected
    behavior in dialogue or faction interactions.
