  class: Player
  method: UpdatePotionCooldown
  signature: void Player::UpdatePotionCooldown(Spell * spell)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown state for potion usage based on the provided spell.
  description: The UpdatePotionCooldown method manages the internal cooldown tracking
    for potion abilities within the Player class. This method is typically invoked
    when a player uses a potion spell to ensure proper cooldown mechanics are enforced.
    It updates the player's potion cooldown timers and may trigger related UI updates
    or game state changes. The method operates on the provided Spell object to determine
    which potion cooldown should be updated, ensuring that players cannot use potions
    too frequently according to game balance rules.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object representing the potion being used. This
      parameter determines which specific potion cooldown is updated and ensures proper
      tracking of cooldown states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Potion Cooldown Update
    code: 'Spell* potionSpell = player->GetSpell(12345);

      player->UpdatePotionCooldown(potionSpell);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    successfully uses a potion. Developers should be aware that this method modifies
    internal cooldown state and may affect subsequent potion usage attempts.
  warnings: Ensure that the Spell parameter is valid and represents an actual potion
    spell before calling this method, as passing invalid or null spell pointers could
    lead to undefined behavior.
