  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastLivingFlame
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastLivingFlame(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Living Flame spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastLivingFlame method is responsible for executing the Living
    Flame spell cast by an Evoker AI character. This method selects a target from
    the provided pointer and initiates the spell casting sequence, which typically
    involves channeling or instant-casting depending on the spell's properties. The
    method likely handles spell targeting, cooldown management, and ensures proper
    execution within the context of the Evoker's combat AI behavior. It is designed
    to be called during the AI's update cycle when the conditions for casting Living
    Flame are met.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        CastLivingFlame(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and accessible within the current
    game context. The Evoker AI must ensure proper targeting logic before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes or invalid spell casts.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit; otherwise, the
    spell may fail or cause undefined behavior. Avoid calling this method outside
    of combat or when the Evoker is in an invalid state such as being stunned or silenced.
