documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the usage of Brew ability for Monk AI by determining the most effective
    timing and conditions.
  description: The OptimizeBrewUsage method is responsible for calculating and executing
    the most efficient use of the Brew ability within the Monk AI system. This method
    evaluates various combat states, resource levels, and enemy conditions to determine
    when and how to apply Brew for maximum benefit. It considers factors such as current
    health, mana, threat level, and proximity to enemies. The method integrates with
    the broader Monk AI decision-making framework to ensure that Brew usage aligns
    with overall tactical objectives and maintains optimal performance during combat
    encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeBrewUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    optimal Brew usage. The implementation likely involves checking multiple game
    state variables and applying conditional logic based on Monk class mechanics such
    as Brew effects, cooldowns, and resource management.
