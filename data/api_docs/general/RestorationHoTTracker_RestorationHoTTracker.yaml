documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the RestorationHoTTracker class for managing
    healing-over-time effects.
  description: The RestorationHoTTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the RestorationHoTTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing
    healing-over-time (HoT) effects in the context of restoration spells within World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. This class likely maintains internal state
    for active HoT ticks, durations, and application logic specific to restoration-based
    healing abilities such as Rejuvenation, Regrowth, or other similar spells. The
    constructor sets up necessary data structures and default values required for
    tracking these effects during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RestorationHoTTracker instance
    code: 'RestorationHoTTracker tracker;

      // Initializes a new HoT tracker with default settings

      // Ready to track restoration-based healing effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the spell system when
    a restoration HoT effect is applied to a target. Developers should be aware that
    the actual tracking and application of HoT effects occurs through other methods
    in the class, not directly from this constructor.
