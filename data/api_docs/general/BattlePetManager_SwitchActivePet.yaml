  method: SwitchActivePet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::SwitchActivePet(int * player, uint32 petIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Switches the active battle pet for the specified player to the pet at the
    given index.
  description: 'The SwitchActivePet method allows a player to change their currently
    active battle pet to another one from their collection. This function takes a
    pointer to a player object and a pet index, validating that the pet exists and
    is accessible before performing the switch. The method ensures proper synchronization
    of the battle pet state within the game world and updates relevant UI elements
    accordingly. It''s commonly used during battle pet encounters or when players
    want to manage their active companion. Precondition: The player must be valid
    and have access to the specified pet index; Postcondition: The active pet is updated
    for the player, and the method returns true if successful.'
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose active battle pet will be switched.
      Must not be null.
  - name: petIndex
    description: Index of the battle pet in the player's collection to switch to.
      Should be a valid index within the range of available pets.
  returns: True if the active pet was successfully switched, false otherwise. Returns
    false if the player is invalid or the pet index is out of bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SwitchActivePet
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 petIndex =\
      \ 2;\nbool success = BattlePetManager::SwitchActivePet(&player, petIndex);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Active pet switched successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during battle pet interactions or when managing
    a player's active companion. It assumes that the player object and pet index are
    valid, and it may perform internal checks to ensure the pet exists in the player's
    collection.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this function.
    Also, verify that the petIndex is within the valid range of the player's battle
    pets to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
