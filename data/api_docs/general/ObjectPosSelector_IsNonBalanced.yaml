  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: IsNonBalanced
  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::IsNonBalanced() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object position selector is in non-balanced mode.
  description: The IsNonBalanced method checks if the ObjectPosSelector instance is
    currently configured to use a non-balanced positioning algorithm. This typically
    relates to how objects are positioned in relation to each other, particularly
    in scenarios involving crowd control, area of effect spells, or positioning mechanics
    where balanced versus non-balanced placement affects gameplay behavior. The method
    returns true when the selector operates in a mode that does not enforce strict
    balancing constraints, and false otherwise. This can be relevant for spell effects,
    creature AI behaviors, or any system requiring flexible object placement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectPosSelector is in non-balanced mode, indicating
    that positioning does not strictly enforce balance constraints; returns false
    if it is in balanced mode where positioning follows strict balancing rules.
  examples:
  - title: Check if ObjectPosSelector is Non-Balanced
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\n// ... configure selector ...\nif (selector.IsNonBalanced())\
      \ {\n    // Handle non-balanced positioning logic\n    printf(\"Using non-balanced\
      \ positioning\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle balanced positioning logic\n \
      \   printf(\"Using balanced positioning\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with positioning systems that
    support both balanced and non-balanced modes. It's important to understand the
    context of when a selector switches between these modes, as it can affect spell
    behavior or AI decision-making.
