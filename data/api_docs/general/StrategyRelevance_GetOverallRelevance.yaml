  method: GetOverallRelevance
  signature: float StrategyRelevance::GetOverallRelevance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall relevance score of a strategy based on
    current game state and conditions.
  description: The GetOverallRelevance method computes a float value representing
    how relevant or applicable a given strategy is within the current context of the
    AI system. This score typically influences decision-making processes in TrinityCore's
    AI framework, determining which strategies should be prioritized or executed.
    The calculation considers various factors such as player health, target distance,
    available resources, and environmental conditions. The method is designed to be
    called frequently during AI update cycles to provide dynamic relevance assessments
    that adapt to changing game states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the overall relevance of
    the strategy. A value of 0.0 indicates the strategy is completely irrelevant,
    while 1.0 indicates maximum relevance. Values in between represent varying degrees
    of applicability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float relevance = strategy->GetOverallRelevance();\nif (relevance > 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Execute the strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Selection Based on Relevance
    code: "std::vector<StrategyRelevance*> strategies;\n// ... populate strategies\
      \ ...\n\nStrategyRelevance* bestStrategy = nullptr;\nfloat highestRelevance\
      \ = 0.0f;\n\nfor (auto& strategy : strategies)\n{\n    float relevance = strategy->GetOverallRelevance();\n\
      \    if (relevance > highestRelevance)\n    {\n        highestRelevance = relevance;\n\
      \        bestStrategy = strategy;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestStrategy && highestRelevance\
      \ > 0.1f)\n{\n    // Execute the most relevant strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may involve expensive
    calculations depending on the complexity of the strategy being evaluated. The
    returned value should be treated as a dynamic score that changes with game state,
    so caching results for extended periods may lead to outdated decisions.
  warnings: The relevance calculation may depend on external factors like player position,
    target status, or resource availability. If these underlying conditions change
    rapidly, calling this method too frequently without proper throttling could impact
    performance. Also, ensure that the strategy object is properly initialized before
    calling this method.
