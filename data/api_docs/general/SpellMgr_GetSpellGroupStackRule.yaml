documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the stack rule for a specified spell group.
  description: The GetSpellGroupStackRule method retrieves the stack rule that defines
    how spells within a given spell group interact with each other in terms of stacking
    behavior. This is used internally by the spell system to determine whether multiple
    spells from the same group can be applied simultaneously or if they should override
    or stack according to specific rules. The returned SpellGroupStackRule enum value
    indicates the stacking policy for the specified spell group, which may affect
    effects like buffs, debuffs, or aura applications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellGroupStackRule enum value that defines how spells in the
    given group should behave when stacked. Possible values typically include SGSR_DEFAULT
    (stack normally), SGSR_NO_STACK (do not stack), and others depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Stack Rule for a Spell Group
    code: "SpellGroupStackRule rule = sSpellMgr->GetSpellGroupStackRule(SPELL_GROUP_FIREBALL);\n\
      if (rule == SGSR_NO_STACK)\n{\n    // Handle case where spells in this group\
      \ cannot stack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell processing and aura application
    logic. It's important to note that the actual spell group identifiers (SpellGroup)
    must be defined and registered within the spell system for this method to return
    meaningful results.
