documentation:
  brief: Returns the GameObjectTemplate structure associated with this game object,
    providing access to its definition and properties.
  description: The GetGOInfo method retrieves the GameObjectTemplate pointer that
    defines the characteristics and behavior of this specific game object. This template
    contains all static information about the GameObject, including its display ID,
    type, data fields, and other essential attributes. The method is commonly used
    in game logic to access static properties of game objects, such as their visual
    representation or interaction mechanics. It serves as a bridge between dynamic
    GameObject instances and their static definitions, allowing developers to query
    the underlying template information without needing to perform complex lookup
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObjectTemplate structure which contains all
    static data about this game object. The returned pointer may be null if the GameObject
    has not been properly initialized or if the template data is missing, though in
    normal operation this should never occur as the GameObject should always have
    valid template information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nconst GameObjectTemplate* goInfo = go->GetGOInfo();\n\
      if (goInfo)\n{\n    // Access properties like displayID, type, etc.\n    uint32\
      \ displayId = goInfo->displayId;\n    uint32 type = goInfo->type;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nconst GameObjectTemplate* goInfo = go->GetGOInfo();\n\
      uint32 type = goInfo->type;\nswitch (type)\n{\n    case GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR:\n\
      \        // Handle door-specific logic\n        break;\n    case GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_BUTTON:\n\
      \        // Handle button-specific logic\n        break;\n    default:\n   \
      \     // Handle other types\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It's
    important to note that the returned GameObjectTemplate pointer should not be modified
    as it represents static data that is shared across all instances of that game
    object type. The method is optimized for performance and does not perform any
    complex operations or lookups.
  warnings: The method returns a null pointer if the GameObject has not been properly
    initialized, which may indicate an error in the game object's creation process.
    Developers should always check for null returns before accessing template data
    to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
