  class: SocialManager
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void SocialManager::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates social action cooldowns for all players in the manager.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method processes and updates the cooldown timers
    for social actions such as sending friend requests, guild invitations, or other
    player-to-player interactions. This method is typically called periodically by
    the game loop to ensure that cooldowns are properly decremented and that players
    can perform social actions once their cooldowns expire. It manages internal state
    tracking for each player's cooldown periods and ensures that no social action
    can be performed before its respective cooldown has completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sSocialMgr->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically every tick or at fixed
    intervals, to ensure proper cooldown management. It is not thread-safe and should
    only be invoked from the main game thread.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal cooldown
    state management. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior in social interactions
    or cooldowns not being properly reset.
