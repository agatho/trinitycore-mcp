documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BehaviorMetadata class with default values.
  description: The BehaviorMetadata constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BehaviorMetadata class. This method sets up the internal state of the object with
    default values, preparing it for use in AI behavior systems within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor is typically called when creating new behavior metadata
    objects that will be used to define or modify NPC AI behaviors. It ensures that
    all member variables are properly initialized before any other operations are
    performed on the object.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BehaviorMetadata instance
    code: 'BehaviorMetadata metadata;

      // The metadata object is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be used in AI behavior configurations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the BehaviorMetadata class which is designed
    to store and manage metadata for AI behaviors. It's important to note that while
    this constructor initializes the object, additional configuration may be required
    before the metadata can be effectively used in behavior systems.
