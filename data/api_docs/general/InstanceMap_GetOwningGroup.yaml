  signature: Group * InstanceMap::GetOwningGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group that owns this instance map.
  description: The GetOwningGroup method retrieves the Group object associated with
    the instance map, which represents the party or raid group that originally created
    or entered the instance. This is typically used to determine ownership and permissions
    within dungeon or raid instances. The method returns a pointer to the Group object
    if the instance has an owning group, or nullptr if no group owns the instance.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, instance maps are often tied
    to player groups for loot distribution, instance reset mechanics, and access control.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object that owns this instance map, or nullptr if
    no group owns it.
  examples:
  - title: Check if instance has an owning group
    code: "InstanceMap* instance = ...;\nGroup* owningGroup = instance->GetOwningGroup();\n\
      if (owningGroup != nullptr)\n{\n    // Instance is owned by a group\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Instance owned by group: %u\", owningGroup->GetId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No\
      \ group owns this instance\n    sLog->outString(\"No group owns this instance.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in instance management systems to enforce group-based
    access control and loot distribution rules. The returned Group pointer should
    not be modified directly as it represents the actual group object associated with
    the instance.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned Group pointer may be nullptr if no group owns
    the instance, so always check for null before using the result. Also, do not assume
    that the group is still valid or active when using the returned pointer, as groups
    can be disbanded or leave instances.
