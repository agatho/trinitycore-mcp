  class: AuctionHouse
  method: CalculateMaxBidAmount
  signature: uint32 AuctionHouse::CalculateMaxBidAmount(int * player, uint32 itemId,
    uint32 stackSize)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the maximum bid amount for an auction item based on player, item,
    and stack size.
  description: The CalculateMaxBidAmount method determines the highest possible bid
    a player can place on an auction item. It takes into account the player's current
    bidding power, the item's base value, and the quantity of items in the stack.
    This function is typically used within the auction house system to validate bids
    and ensure fair gameplay mechanics. The calculation considers various in-game
    factors such as item rarity, market demand, and player reputation or gold reserves.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or bidding
      capacity. This parameter likely refers to a player's GUID or internal player
      index used for auction validation.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item being auctioned. This value corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's database and is used to retrieve item properties
      for bid calculation.
  - name: stackSize
    description: Number of items in the stack being auctioned. This parameter affects
      the total bid amount as larger stacks generally require higher bids according
      to auction house rules.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the maximum allowable bid amount in
    copper coins. This represents the highest price a player can offer for the specified
    item stack.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 maxBid = auctionHouse->CalculateMaxBidAmount(&playerGuid, 12345,
      10);

      // Calculates maximum bid for 10 stacks of item ID 12345

      printf("Maximum bid: %u copper\n", maxBid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction Validation
    code: "int playerGuid = 54321;\nuint32 itemId = 98765;\nuint32 stackSize = 1;\n\
      uint32 maxBid = auctionHouse->CalculateMaxBidAmount(&playerGuid, itemId, stackSize);\n\
      if (bidAmount <= maxBid) {\n    // Proceed with auction bid\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Reject bid - exceeds maximum allowed amount\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates game-specific rules such as item quality
    multipliers, player gold limits, and auction house commission calculations. The
    exact formula for bid calculation may vary based on server settings or expansion
    content.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player identifier;
    invalid references may cause undefined behavior. The stack size should be validated
    to prevent overflow conditions in high-volume auctions.
