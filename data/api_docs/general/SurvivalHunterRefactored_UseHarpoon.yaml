  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UseHarpoon(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Harpoon ability for a survival hunter, targeting the specified
    unit.
  description: The UseHarpoon method implements the Harpoon ability for a survival
    hunter class in TrinityCore. This ability is used to pull a target unit towards
    the hunter, typically employed for crowd control or positioning purposes during
    combat. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing the target unit's
    identifier and performs the necessary checks and actions to execute the spell.
    It integrates with the hunter's AI logic to ensure proper targeting and cooldown
    management. This ability is particularly useful in survival hunter gameplay for
    controlling enemy movement and maintaining optimal distance from threats.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject or Unit GUID in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Harpoon Usage
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      this->UseHarpoon(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Harpoon with Target Validation
    code: "if (target != nullptr && target->IsAlive()) {\n    int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    this->UseHarpoon(&targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the hunter's spell system and cooldown
    management. It may require the hunter to be in a valid combat state and have sufficient
    mana or resources to cast the ability. The target parameter should be validated
    before calling to prevent invalid operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid target GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or failed spell execution. Ensure that the target unit exists and is
    within range before invoking this method.
