  class: LootDistribution
  method: GetPlayerLootMetrics
  signature: LootMetrics LootDistribution::GetPlayerLootMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves loot distribution metrics for a specific player by their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerLootMetrics method fetches detailed statistics and performance
    data related to loot distribution for a given player. This includes information
    such as total items looted, gold acquired, and other relevant metrics that track
    how effectively a player participates in loot systems within the game. The method
    is typically used for tracking player engagement with loot mechanics, generating
    reports, or analyzing gameplay behavior. It requires a valid player GUID to retrieve
    accurate data, and returns an empty or default LootMetrics structure if no data
    exists for the specified player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose loot metrics are
      being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A LootMetrics object containing detailed statistics about the specified
    player's loot distribution activity. If no data is found for the provided player
    GUID, an empty or default-initialized LootMetrics structure is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Player Loot Metrics
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nLootMetrics metrics = lootDistribution->GetPlayerLootMetrics(playerId);\n\
      TC_LOG_INFO(\"loot\", \"Player %u has looted %u items with total value of %u\
      \ gold.\",\n    playerId, metrics.itemCount, metrics.totalGold);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal loot tracking systems and may involve database
    queries or cached data structures depending on the implementation. It is recommended
    to cache results when frequently accessed for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided player GUID is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the world to avoid returning incorrect or default metrics. Invalid GUIDs
    might result in undefined behavior or empty return values.
