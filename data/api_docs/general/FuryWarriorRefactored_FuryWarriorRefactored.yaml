    state, including weapon configurations, stance management, and combat routines.

    warrior abilities and strategies. It ensures that all necessary variables are

  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null, and the player object must be properly initialized
    before passing to this constructor.
  warnings: Calling this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player object passed is
    valid and has been allocated in memory.
