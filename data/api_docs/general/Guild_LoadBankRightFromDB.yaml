  class: Guild
  method: LoadBankRightFromDB
  signature: void Guild::LoadBankRightFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads bank rights for guild members from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadBankRightFromDB method retrieves bank right information for
    guild members stored in the database and populates internal data structures with
    this information. This method is typically invoked during guild initialization
    or when refreshing guild data to ensure that current bank permissions are correctly
    loaded. It processes raw database fields containing guild member IDs, tab IDs,
    and permission levels, mapping them to appropriate internal representations for
    use in game mechanics such as bank access control.
  parameters:
  - name: fields
    description: An array of database field values representing guild bank rights
      data. Expected fields include member GUID, tab ID, and right level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in guild initialization
    code: "void Guild::LoadBankRightFromDB(int * fields)\n{\n    // Example implementation\n\
      \    uint32 guid = fields[0];\n    uint8 tabId = fields[1];\n    uint8 right\
      \ = fields[2];\n    // Process and store bank rights\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild data loading mechanism. It assumes
    that database connection is already established and that the input 'fields' parameter
    contains valid data in expected order. The method should not be called directly
    by external code unless implementing custom guild loading logic.
  warnings: Incorrect field ordering or invalid data types in the 'fields' array may
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all database fields are properly validated
    before processing.
