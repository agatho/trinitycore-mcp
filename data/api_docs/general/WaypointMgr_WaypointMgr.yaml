documentation:
  brief: Moves a WaypointMgr object to another WaypointMgr instance, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The WaypointMgr move constructor transfers all internal resources and
    state from the source WaypointMgr object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used when moving objects between containers or when passing objects
    by value in scenarios where performance optimization is desired. The source object
    becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used. This constructor
    is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics, enabling efficient resource
    management without unnecessary copying.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a WaypointMgr instance
    code: 'WaypointMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with waypoints ...

      WaypointMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor called

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. It's designed to avoid
    expensive copying operations by transferring ownership of resources. After the
    move, the source object should not be accessed as its state is undefined.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the source object
    after calling this constructor.
