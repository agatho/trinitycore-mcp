documentation:
  brief: Plays a spell visual effect associated with the specified spell visual ID
    at the area trigger's location.
  description: The PlaySpellVisual method triggers the display of a spell visual effect
    at the area trigger's current position. This method is typically used to show
    graphical effects such as aura visuals, spell impacts, or other visual feedback
    for area triggers. The spell visual ID corresponds to an entry in the SpellVisual.dbc
    file which defines how the visual should appear. The effect is played locally
    for all players within range of the area trigger. No parameters are required as
    the method uses the area trigger's existing properties and position to determine
    where and how to play the visual.

  notes: This method only plays visuals that are defined in the SpellVisual.dbc file.
    The visual effect will be displayed to all players within the area trigger's detection
    range. The method does not return any value and does not affect the area trigger's
    logic or behavior beyond playing the visual.
