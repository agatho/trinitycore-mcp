  brief: Removes the vehicle from the world and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Vehicle::Uninstall method is responsible for completely removing
    a vehicle object from the game world. This operation typically occurs when a vehicle
    is being destroyed, sold, or no longer needed in the current context. The method
    ensures that all references to the vehicle are cleared, any passengers are removed
    from the vehicle, and the vehicle's resources are properly deallocated. It also
    handles cleanup of the vehicle's associated data structures and may trigger related
    events such as passenger dismounting notifications. This method should only be
    called when it is safe to remove the vehicle from active gameplay.

    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->Uninstall();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly on vehicles that are currently
    occupied by players or creatures. The uninstall process will automatically handle
    passenger removal and cleanup of vehicle data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on a vehicle that is actively being used by passengers
    may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Always ensure the vehicle
    is empty before calling Uninstall.
