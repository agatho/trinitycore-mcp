  class: AzeriteItem
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void AzeriteItem::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask for the Azerite item, optionally removing it from
    updates.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of an AzeriteItem
    instance. This is typically used during synchronization operations or when preparing
    the item for removal from active update lists. When the 'remove' parameter is
    set to true, the item may also be marked for removal from any active update queues
    or tracking systems. The method ensures that subsequent update operations will
    not include this item unless explicitly re-added to the update mask.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, the item is marked for removal from update tracking; if
      false, only the mask is cleared without removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Update Mask Without Removal
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = ...;

      item->ClearUpdateMask(false); // Only clears the mask

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Update Mask and Remove Item
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = ...;

      item->ClearUpdateMask(true); // Clears mask and marks for removal

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore update system.
    Developers should ensure that clearing the update mask does not interfere with
    active gameplay mechanics or player interactions involving Azerite items.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause the item to become out-of-sync with
    client updates, potentially leading to visual glitches or incorrect item states
    in the game world.
