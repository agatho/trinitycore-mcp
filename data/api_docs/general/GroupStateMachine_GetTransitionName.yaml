    transition)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the string name of a group state transition
  description: The GetTransitionName method retrieves the human-readable string representation
    of a GroupStateTransition enum value. This method is used internally by the GroupStateMachine
    to provide descriptive names for different group state transitions, which can
    be useful for debugging, logging, or displaying user-facing messages about group
    state changes. The method takes a single GroupStateTransition parameter and returns
    its corresponding string identifier. This functionality supports the state machine's
    ability to track and communicate group membership changes throughout a player's
    session in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: transition
    description: The GroupStateTransition enum value for which to retrieve the string
      name. Valid values include various group state transition types such as JOIN,
      LEAVE, DISBAND, etc.
  returns: A std::string containing the human-readable name of the specified group
    state transition. Returns an empty string if the transition value is invalid or
    unrecognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupStateTransition trans = GroupStateTransition::JOIN;

      std::string transitionName = stateMachine.GetTransitionName(trans);

      // transitionName would contain "JOIN" or equivalent string'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Group State Changes
    code: "void LogGroupTransition(GroupStateMachine& fsm, GroupStateTransition trans)\
      \ {\n    std::string name = fsm.GetTransitionName(trans);\n    if (!name.empty())\
      \ {\n        LOG_INFO(\"group\", \"Group transition: {}\", name);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal mapping or switch statement to convert
    enum values to their string representations. The implementation should be efficient
    since it's used during state transitions. Developers should note that the returned
    strings are meant for debugging and logging purposes, not for user interface display.
  warnings: The method may return an empty string for invalid transition values, so
    callers should verify the result before using it. Since this is part of a state
    machine implementation, ensure thread safety if used in concurrent contexts.
