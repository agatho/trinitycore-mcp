documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotActionQueue class for managing queued
    bot actions.
  description: The BotActionQueue constructor initializes a new instance of the BotActionQueue
    class, setting up internal data structures to manage a queue of actions that bots
    can perform. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to
    handle asynchronous or scheduled bot behaviors, such as movement commands, spell
    casting, or interaction with game objects. The queue maintains order of operations
    and ensures that bot actions are processed in a controlled manner according to
    game logic requirements.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotActionQueue instance
    code: 'BotActionQueue queue;

      // The queue is now initialized and ready to accept actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic structure for managing bot actions. Developers
    should ensure that instances are properly managed to avoid memory leaks, especially
    when dealing with multiple bot instances.
