  class: VendorInteraction
  method: SetSellingStrategy
  signature: void VendorInteraction::SetSellingStrategy(uint32 playerGuid, const SellingStrategy
    & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the selling strategy for a player's vendor interaction.
  description: The SetSellingStrategy method configures the selling behavior of a
    vendor interaction for a specific player. This method allows the game to define
    how items should be sold, including pricing strategies, item selection criteria,
    and inventory management rules during vendor transactions. The strategy parameter
    defines the complete set of rules that govern the selling process, which may include
    dynamic pricing, item quality filters, or special sale conditions. This method
    is typically called when initializing or modifying a player's vendor interaction
    session.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose vendor selling strategy
      is being set. This value must correspond to an active player in the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: An instance of SellingStrategy that defines the rules and behavior
      for how items should be sold during this vendor interaction. The strategy may
      include parameters such as price multipliers, item filtering criteria, and sale
      conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      SellingStrategy strategy;

      strategy.SetPriceMultiplier(1.5f);

      strategy.AddItemFilter(ItemQuality::EPIC);

      vendor.SetSellingStrategy(12345, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Strategy
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      SellingStrategy strategy;

      strategy.SetPriceMultiplier(player->GetLevel() > 60 ? 2.0f : 1.0f);

      strategy.SetSaleDuration(3600); // 1 hour

      vendor.SetSellingStrategy(playerGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vendor interaction system and should be called
    before initiating any actual selling operations. The SellingStrategy object passed
    in is copied, so modifications to the original object after calling this method
    will not affect the vendor's behavior. This method does not validate the strategy
    contents; it is expected that the caller ensures the strategy is properly configured.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid playerGuid (e.g., a GUID that doesn't
    correspond to an active player) may result in undefined behavior or errors during
    subsequent vendor interactions. Ensure that the SellingStrategy object passed
    in is valid and complete before calling this method, as incomplete strategies
    may lead to unexpected selling behaviors.
