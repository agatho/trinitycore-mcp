  class: AfflictionDoTTracker
  method: HasDoT
  signature: bool AfflictionDoTTracker::HasDoT(int targetGuid, uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific target has an active Affliction DoT spell.
  description: The HasDoT method determines whether a given target currently has an
    active Affliction damage-over-time (DoT) spell applied to them. This method is
    typically used in Warlock AI logic to track the status of affliction effects like
    Corruption, Unstable Affliction, or other DoT spells that are part of the Affliction
    specialization. It performs a lookup within the internal tracking system to verify
    if the specified spell is currently active on the target. The method does not
    modify any state but returns a boolean value indicating the presence or absence
    of the DoT effect.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to check for an active
      DoT spell.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID of the specific Affliction DoT spell to verify is active
      on the target.
  returns: True if the specified target has the given Affliction DoT spell active;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Corruption DoT
    code: "if (afflictionDoTTracker->HasDoT(targetGuid, 146739)) {\n    // Target\
      \ is affected by Corruption\n    // Perform some action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on DoT Status
    code: "if (!afflictionDoTTracker->HasDoT(targetGuid, 30108)) {\n    // Target\
      \ does not have Unstable Affliction\n    // Cast it if possible\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of DoT spells and assumes that the
    AfflictionDoTTracker has been properly initialized with relevant spell data. The
    method is likely optimized for frequent checks during combat, so performance should
    be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that targetGuid and spellId are valid before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. This method may not account for DoTs
    applied through certain mechanics like procs or external effects unless explicitly
    tracked by the system.
