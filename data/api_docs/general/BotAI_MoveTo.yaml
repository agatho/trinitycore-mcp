  class: BotAI
  method: MoveTo
  signature: void BotAI::MoveTo(float x, float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action for the bot to the specified coordinates in the
    world.
  description: The MoveTo method instructs the BotAI instance to navigate its associated
    creature or unit to the given (x, y, z) coordinates within the game world. This
    method typically triggers pathfinding and movement logic that handles terrain,
    obstacles, and NPC behavior to reach the destination. The bot will continue moving
    until it reaches the target location or is interrupted by another AI command.
    It's commonly used in quest completion, patrol following, or targeted movement
    behaviors for automated gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the target position in world space.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the target position in world space.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the target position in world space.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement to Coordinates
    code: 'BotAI* bot = ...;

      bot->MoveTo(123.45f, 678.90f, 100.00f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Moving to Player Position
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      BotAI* bot = ...;

      bot->MoveTo(player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(), player->GetPositionZ());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not block execution; movement occurs asynchronously. The
    actual pathfinding and movement may take several game ticks to complete depending
    on the distance and environment. Ensure that the target coordinates are valid
    and within the bounds of the current map.
  warnings: Calling MoveTo with invalid or unreachable coordinates can cause the bot
    to become stuck or enter an undefined state. Always validate positions before
    calling this method, especially when using dynamic coordinates such as those from
    player positions.
