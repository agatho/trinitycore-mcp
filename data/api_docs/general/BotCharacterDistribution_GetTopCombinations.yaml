  signature: std::vector<RaceClassCombination> BotCharacterDistribution::GetTopCombinations(uint32
    limit) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the top race-class combinations based on distribution priority.
  description: The GetTopCombinations method returns a vector of RaceClassCombination
    objects that represent the most frequently or prioritized character race and class
    pairings within the bot character distribution system. This method is typically
    used to determine which character builds are most common or preferred for AI-controlled
    bots in World of Warcraft environments. The returned combinations are ordered
    by their priority or frequency, with the highest-ranked entries appearing first
    in the vector. The limit parameter controls how many top combinations are returned,
    allowing for efficient retrieval of the most relevant data without unnecessary
    overhead.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<RaceClassCombination> containing the top race-class combinations
    sorted by priority or frequency. Each element represents a valid combination that
    can be used to create AI-controlled characters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Top 5 Race-Class Combinations
    code: "BotCharacterDistribution distribution;\nstd::vector<RaceClassCombination>\
      \ topCombinations = distribution.GetTopCombinations(5);\nfor (const auto& combo\
      \ : topCombinations) {\n    std::cout << \"Race: \" << combo.race << \", Class:\
      \ \" << combo.class << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that track character
    distribution statistics. It may be called frequently during bot initialization
    or character generation processes, so performance considerations should be taken
    into account when using large limits.
