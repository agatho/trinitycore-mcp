  signature: uint8 Guild::GetLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current level of the guild.
  description: The GetLevel method returns the current level of the guild as defined
    in the game's progression system. In World of Warcraft and TrinityCore, guilds
    advance through levels by accumulating experience points earned through member
    activities such as completing achievements, participating in world events, and
    other in-game actions. This method provides read-only access to the guild's level,
    which is used for determining various guild benefits, permissions, and capabilities
    within the game. The returned value represents a numeric level from 1 to the maximum
    allowed guild level, typically 25 in most game versions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the current level of the guild. Valid values
    range from 1 to the maximum guild level (typically 25), with 1 being the starting
    level for newly created guilds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);

      uint8 currentLevel = myGuild->GetLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO("guild", "Guild level is: %u", currentLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Guild Level for Permissions
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild && guild->GetLevel() >= 10)\n\
      {\n    // Grant advanced guild permissions\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"guild\", \"Guild\
      \ has sufficient level for advanced features\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple getter operation and does not involve any database
    queries or complex calculations. The guild level is cached internally, so calling
    this method repeatedly will not cause performance degradation. It's safe to call
    from any thread context as long as the Guild object itself is valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the Guild pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. While the method itself is read-only, be cautious when using
    its result in conditional logic that might affect game state or player experience.
