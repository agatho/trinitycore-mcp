  method: IsValuableForVendoring
  signature: bool LootAnalysis::IsValuableForVendoring(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a loot item is valuable enough for vendoring based on
    its quality and value thresholds.
  description: The IsValuableForVendoring method evaluates whether a given LootItem
    meets specific criteria to be considered valuable for selling to vendors. This
    typically involves checking the item's quality, vendor sell price, and other relevant
    attributes that determine if it's worth keeping or selling. The method is used
    in loot analysis systems to help players make informed decisions about which items
    to keep versus sell. It ensures that only items meeting predefined value thresholds
    are marked as valuable for vendoring purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A constant reference to a LootItem object representing the item being
      evaluated for vendoring potential.
  returns: Returns true if the loot item is considered valuable enough for vendoring
    based on internal thresholds and quality checks; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "LootItem item;\n// ... populate item ...\nif (lootAnalysis.IsValuableForVendoring(item))\
      \ {\n    // Item is valuable enough to consider selling\n    printf(\"Item is\
      \ valuable for vendoring\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Item should be kept or discarded\
      \ based on other criteria\n    printf(\"Item not valuable for vendoring\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot decision logic
    code: "void ProcessLoot(LootAnalysis& analysis, const std::vector<LootItem>& items)\
      \ {\n    for (const auto& item : items) {\n        if (analysis.IsValuableForVendoring(item))\
      \ {\n            // Add to vendor sell list\n            VendorSellList.push_back(item);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Keep or discard based on other criteria\n\
      \            KeepItemList.push_back(item);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal thresholds and quality checks that may vary
    depending on the game version or server configuration. The exact value thresholds
    for what constitutes 'valuable' are not publicly documented but are typically
    based on item quality, vendor sell price, and possibly item level or rarity.
  warnings: The method assumes valid LootItem input and does not perform null checks.
    Using with invalid or uninitialized LootItem objects may lead to undefined behavior.
    The value thresholds used internally might change between different World of Warcraft
    expansions or TrinityCore versions.
