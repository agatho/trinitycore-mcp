  class: Group
  method: DelinkMember
  signature: void Group::DelinkMember(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a member from the group's linked loot system, unlinking their loot
    settings.
  description: The DelinkMember method removes a specific group member from the group's
    linked loot system. This operation effectively resets the loot settings for the
    specified player within the group context, ensuring that future loot distribution
    will not be influenced by previous linking decisions. The method operates on the
    GUID of the player to be unlinked and is typically used when a player leaves a
    group or when loot settings need to be reset for individual members. This functionality
    is crucial in maintaining proper loot distribution mechanics in World of Warcraft's
    group systems, particularly for groups using linked loot or free-for-all loot
    modes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player member to be unlinked
      from the group's loot system. This should correspond to a valid player GUID
      within the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unlink a specific group member by GUID
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 targetGuid\
      \ = 123456789;\n    group->DelinkMember(targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    when players leave or are removed from a group. It does not remove the player
    from the group itself, but only resets their loot linking status. The GUID parameter
    should be validated to ensure it corresponds to an actual member of the group
    to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-member GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or silently fail. Always verify that the GUID represents a valid group
    member before calling DelinkMember. This method does not perform any checks for
    group state or player status, so ensure proper context before invocation.
