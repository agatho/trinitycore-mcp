  class: AfflictionWarlockRefactored
  method: ConsumeSoulShard
  signature: void AfflictionWarlockRefactored::ConsumeSoulShard(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified number of soul shards from the Affliction Warlock's
    resource pool.
  description: The ConsumeSoulShard method reduces the number of available soul shards
    for an Affliction Warlock by the given amount. This method is typically invoked
    when casting spells that require soul shard resources, such as Seed of Corruption
    or Shadow Bolt. The method ensures that sufficient soul shards are present before
    consumption and may trigger resource management behaviors within the class. It
    operates on the internal soul shard counter and does not directly interact with
    the player's inventory or UI elements.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of soul shards to consume from the warlock's resource
      pool. Must be a positive integer representing valid soul shard count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Soul Shard Consumption
    code: 'AfflictionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.ConsumeSoulShard(1); // Consumes one soul shard'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Soul Shards
    code: 'AfflictionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.ConsumeSoulShard(3); // Consumes three soul shards for a multi-target
      spell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that sufficient soul shards are available before calling.
    It is recommended to check the current soul shard count using GetSoulShardCount()
    prior to invoking this method to prevent invalid operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying available resources may result in
    negative soul shard counts or undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of
    resource availability before consumption.
