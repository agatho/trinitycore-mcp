  class: MultiFloorExplore
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void MultiFloorExplore::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for a multi-floor exploration object to a byte buffer
    for transmission to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a MultiFloorExplore
    object into a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission. This method
    is typically invoked when sending initial data about an exploration object to
    a client player, ensuring that the client has all necessary information to render
    or interact with the multi-floor exploration feature. The serialization process
    includes relevant metadata such as object identifiers, position coordinates, floor
    levels, and any associated flags or settings. It is designed to be called during
    the object's initialization phase when it needs to be made visible or accessible
    to specific players in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized creation data will
      be written. This buffer is used for network packet construction and must be
      properly initialized before calling this method.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that owns or controls the MultiFloorExplore
      instance. Used to determine ownership-related properties during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this creation data.
      May be used to customize the serialized output based on the receiver's perspective
      or permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* owner = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      exploreObject.WriteCreate(buffer, owner, receiver);

      // Send buffer over network to receiver'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Packet Sending Logic
    code: "void SendExploreData(Player* player)\n{\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    MultiFloorExplore\
      \ explore;\n    explore.WriteCreate(data, player, player);\n    WorldPacket\
      \ packet(SMSG_INIT_WORLD_STATES, data.size());\n    packet.append(data);\n \
      \   player->SendDirectMessage(&packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MultiFloorExplore object has already been properly
    initialized and configured with relevant floor data. The ByteBuffer must be large
    enough to accommodate all serialized fields; otherwise, it may lead to buffer
    overflow issues during append operations. Developers should ensure thread safety
    if multiple threads access or modify the same MultiFloorExplore instance concurrently.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the ByteBuffer can result in invalid packet structures
    or client-side crashes. Ensure that all required fields are included and properly
    formatted before appending data to the buffer. Avoid calling this method on uninitialized
    objects, as it may cause undefined behavior.
