documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the note identifier associated with a bug ticket.
  description: The GetNote method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the note identifier of a bug ticket. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to associate specific notes or comments with bug reports submitted by players.
    The returned value is typically used for indexing or linking purposes within the
    bug tracking system. The method does not modify any state and provides read-only
    access to the internal note identifier field.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the note identifier associated
    with this bug ticket. This value uniquely identifies the note within the bug reporting
    system and is used for linking related data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use bug ticket note ID
    code: "BugTicket* ticket = sBugTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif (ticket)\n\
      {\n    const int& noteId = ticket->GetNote();\n    // Use noteId for further\
      \ processing or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"Bug ticket %u has note ID: %d\"\
      , ticketGuid, noteId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the
    integer value. The returned reference should not be modified as it points directly
    to internal data within the BugTicket object.
