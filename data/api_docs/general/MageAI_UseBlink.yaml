  method: UseBlink
  signature: void MageAI::UseBlink()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Blink spell for a Mage AI character, enabling teleportation
    to a target location.
  description: The UseBlink method is responsible for activating the Blink spell within
    the Mage AI system. This method typically handles the logic required to initiate
    the Blink ability, which allows the Mage character to instantly teleport a short
    distance. The implementation likely includes checks for spell availability, cooldowns,
    and valid target positioning. It may also manage the visual effects and animation
    associated with the Blink spell. This method is part of the general AI behavior
    system for Mage characters in TrinityCore's game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_blinkCooldown <= 0)\n    {\n\
      \        UseBlink();\n        m_blinkCooldown = 15; // Set cooldown period\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called within the Mage AI's update loop or
    when specific combat conditions are met. The actual teleportation mechanics and
    spell validation would be handled by underlying TrinityCore systems, while this
    method serves as a high-level interface for triggering the Blink ability.
  warnings: Ensure that proper cooldown management is implemented before calling this
    method to prevent abuse of the Blink ability. The method may fail silently if
    conditions for casting Blink are not met, so external validation should be performed
    when necessary.
