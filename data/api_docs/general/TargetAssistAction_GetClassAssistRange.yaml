  signature: float TargetAssistAction::GetClassAssistRange(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the assist range specific to the class of the provided
    bot player.
  description: The GetClassAssistRange method determines the appropriate assist range
    for a given bot player based on their class. This range is used by the AI system
    to decide how far away from the target a bot should position itself when performing
    assist actions. The method takes into account class-specific mechanics such as
    spell ranges, melee reach, and combat behavior to return an accurate distance
    value. It's typically called during AI decision-making processes to ensure bots
    maintain optimal positioning for effective support of their targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the assist range in yards for the specified
    bot player's class. This value indicates the maximum distance at which the bot
    will attempt to assist its target during combat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nfloat range = TargetAssistAction::GetClassAssistRange(bot);\n\
      // Use range for positioning logic\nif (range > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with assist\
      \ positioning using the calculated range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal class data tables or configuration values
    to determine the appropriate assist range. The returned value may vary based on
    player level, equipment, and other class-specific factors that affect combat positioning.
