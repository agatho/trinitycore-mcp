documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is in a standing state
  description: This method determines whether the unit is currently in a standing
    state, which is a fundamental game mechanic in World of Warcraft. It returns true
    when the unit is standing and false when the unit is sitting or in any other state.
    The method is commonly used to check the current stance of units such as players,
    NPCs, or pets, and can be particularly useful for determining if a unit is in
    a specific state that affects gameplay mechanics like combat or movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is standing, false otherwise. This indicates whether
    the unit is currently in a standing state rather than sitting or other states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsStandState()) {\n    // Unit is standing\n    // Do something\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Unit is not standing\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other state checking methods
    like IsSitState() or IsSittingState(). The implementation relies on the unit's
    current state flags, which are updated based on actions such as sitting or standing.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not account for different types of standing
    states (e.g., standing with weapon drawn vs. standing without weapon). It only
    checks if the unit is in a standing state, not whether it's standing in a specific
    way.
