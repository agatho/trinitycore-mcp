  signature: int BehaviorAdaptation::ExtractEnvironmentFeatures(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Extracts and processes environmental features for behavior adaptation in
    the AI system.
  description: The ExtractEnvironmentFeatures method analyzes the current environment
    around a bot player to gather relevant data that can be used by the AI for decision-making.
    This includes identifying nearby objects, terrain characteristics, player positions,
    and other contextual elements that influence adaptive behavior. The method is
    typically invoked during AI processing cycles to update the internal state of
    the behavior adaptation system with real-time environmental information. It returns
    an integer status code indicating success or failure of the feature extraction
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful extraction of environment
    features, and non-zero values indicate various error conditions such as invalid
    player reference, failed data processing, or missing environmental context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_behaviorAdaptation)\n    {\n       \
      \ int result = m_behaviorAdaptation->ExtractEnvironmentFeatures(m_bot);\n  \
      \      if (result == 0)\n        {\n            // Proceed with behavior adaptation\
      \ logic\n            m_behaviorAdaptation->ApplyBehavior();\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and relies on the player's
    current position, map data, and nearby game objects. Performance may be impacted
    by the number of environmental features being processed, especially in densely
    populated areas with many interactive objects.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid Player pointer is provided; passing null or
    invalid pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. The extracted
    features are cached internally, so calling this method frequently without proper
    invalidation may lead to stale data usage.
