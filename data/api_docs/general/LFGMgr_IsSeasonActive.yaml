  class: LFGMgr
  method: IsSeasonActive
  signature: bool LFGMgr::IsSeasonActive(uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified dungeon is currently active during a seasonal
    event.
  description: The IsSeasonActive method determines if a given dungeon ID corresponds
    to a seasonal dungeon that is currently active in the game world. This functionality
    is used primarily for LFG (Looking For Group) systems to filter which dungeons
    can be queued for based on current seasonal events such as Holidays or special
    promotions. The method evaluates the dungeon's seasonal status against the current
    game time and event calendar to return an accurate boolean result.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon to check for seasonal activity.
      This ID typically corresponds to entries in the dbc files or database tables
      that define dungeon properties including seasonal flags.
  returns: Returns true if the specified dungeon is currently active during a seasonal
    event, false otherwise. A dungeon may be marked as seasonal even if no active
    season is currently running, so this check ensures the dungeon is both seasonal
    and currently in its active period.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific dungeon is currently seasonal
    code: "if (sLFGMgr->IsSeasonActive(1234)) {\n    // Dungeon is currently active\
      \ during a seasonal event\n    sLog->outString(\"Dungeon 1234 is currently seasonal.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Dungeon is not currently seasonal\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Dungeon 1234 is not currently seasonal.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use within LFG queue filtering logic
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = GetDungeonIdFromLfgEntry(entry);\nif (!sLFGMgr->IsSeasonActive(dungeonId))\
      \ {\n    // Skip seasonal dungeons that are not currently active\n    continue;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with normal LFG queue processing for this dungeon"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal event tracking and calendar systems
    within TrinityCore. It may cache results or use a lookup table to efficiently
    determine seasonal status without recalculating each time. The implementation
    might also consider timezone settings if the game world has time-based events
    that vary by region.
  warnings: Be aware that this function only checks the current seasonal activity
    status and does not validate other LFG requirements such as player level, group
    composition, or instance locks. Also, some dungeons may be marked as seasonal
    but have no active season in progress, so always verify both conditions when implementing
    queue logic.
