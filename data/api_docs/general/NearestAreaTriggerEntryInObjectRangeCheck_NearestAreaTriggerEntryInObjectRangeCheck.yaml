  signature: void NearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck::NearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck(const
    NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a nearest area trigger entry check based on another game object
    range check.
  description: The NearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes
    an instance of this class by copying the parameters from another NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
    object. This class is typically used in TrinityCore's AI and object interaction
    systems to find the nearest area trigger within a specified range of a given object.
    It leverages the underlying game object range checking mechanism to efficiently
    locate qualifying area triggers based on proximity and other criteria defined
    in the source check object.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to an existing NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
      object whose parameters will be copied to initialize this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Area Trigger Check from GameObject Check
    code: 'NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck gameObjectCheck(100.0f, 50.0f,
      25.0f);

      NearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck areaTriggerCheck(gameObjectCheck);

      // The areaTriggerCheck is now initialized with the same parameters as gameObjectCheck'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the source object's parameters.
    The class likely relies on internal state management to track range, entry IDs,
    and other filtering criteria for area triggers in the game world.
