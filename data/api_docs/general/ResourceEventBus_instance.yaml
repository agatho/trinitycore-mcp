documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ResourceEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ResourceEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the event bus exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global event handling
    functionality for resource-related events in TrinityCore's architecture. The returned
    pointer provides access to all resource event subscription and publishing mechanisms,
    allowing subsystems to register for or trigger resource-related notifications
    such as item creation, currency changes, or quest progress updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of ResourceEventBus. The method never
    returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during application
    startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ResourceEventBus* eventBus = ResourceEventBus::instance();

      // Use eventBus to subscribe to resource events

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Subscribing to Events
    code: "ResourceEventBus* bus = ResourceEventBus::instance();\nbus->Subscribe<ResourceUpdateEvent>([](const\
      \ ResourceUpdateEvent& event) {\n    // Handle resource update\n});\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is initialized during
    application startup before any concurrent access can occur. The implementation
    typically uses static local variable initialization which is guaranteed to be
    thread-safe in C++11 and later standards.
