  class: ComboPointSystem
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ComboPointSystem::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of combo points from the system
  description: The Consume method reduces the current combo point count by the specified
    amount. This method is typically used in combat scenarios where abilities or attacks
    consume combo points to trigger effects. The operation will only succeed if there
    are sufficient combo points available to be consumed. If the requested amount
    exceeds the current combo point total, the method will return false without modifying
    the combo point count.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of combo points were successfully
    consumed; returns false if there were insufficient combo points available or if
    the consumption operation failed for any other reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combo Point Consumption
    code: "if (comboSystem.Consume(1)) {\n    // Successfully consumed 1 combo point\n\
      \    // Proceed with combo-based ability execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combo Point Usage
    code: "uint32 requiredPoints = 5;\nif (comboSystem.Consume(requiredPoints)) {\n\
      \    // Execute high-cost combo ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HIGH_COST_COMBO,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Not enough combo points, fallback behavior\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BASIC_ATTACK, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with combat systems and rogue
    class abilities in World of Warcraft. The combo point system is integral to the
    game's resource management for classes like Rogues, Assassins, and Feral Druids.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly interact with player
    UI or visual feedback - it only modifies internal combo point counters.
  warnings: Ensure that sufficient combo points are available before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should not be called in situations
    where combo points are consumed through other means (like spell effects) without
    proper synchronization, as it may lead to inconsistent state.
