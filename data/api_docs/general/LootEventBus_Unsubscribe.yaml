  class: LootEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void LootEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the LootEventBus event system.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI instance from the
    LootEventBus, effectively disconnecting it from receiving loot-related events.
    This method is typically used when a bot is no longer needed or has been destroyed
    to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions. The
    method operates on a singleton event bus system where multiple subscribers can
    listen for loot events such as item drops, loot acquisition, or loot distribution
    within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the event
      subscription list. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... subscribe to events ...

      lootEventBus.Unsubscribe(myBot);

      delete myBot;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a thread-safe event bus implementation, but it's recommended
    to call it from the same thread that manages the BotAI lifecycle to avoid race
    conditions. The underlying data structure for storing subscribers is likely a
    container such as std::set or std::unordered_set for efficient lookup and removal.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance was previously subscribed before attempting to
    unsubscribe, otherwise the operation may have no effect or cause internal inconsistencies.
