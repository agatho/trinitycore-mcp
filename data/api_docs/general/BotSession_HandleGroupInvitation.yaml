documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming group invitation packets for bot sessions
  description: Handles group invitations sent to bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method processes the raw packet data containing group invitation
    information and determines appropriate responses or actions based on the bot's
    configuration and current state. It manages the logic for accepting, rejecting,
    or ignoring group invitations depending on predefined rules and settings. The
    method ensures proper communication between the bot session and the game server
    when handling group-related communications.

  - title: Basic Group Invitation Handling
    code: "void BotSession::HandleGroupInvitation(const int& packet) {\n    // Process\
      \ incoming group invitation\n    if (IsBotActive() && CanAcceptGroupInvitations())\
      \ {\n        AcceptGroupInvitation(packet);\n    } else {\n        RejectGroupInvitation(packet);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the packet processing system when a
    GROUP_INVITE packet is received. The method assumes proper initialization of bot
    session state and should only be called when the bot is in an active state. Implementation
    may involve checking group limits, invitation cooldowns, and bot-specific configuration
    settings.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to bots incorrectly accepting
    or rejecting group invitations, potentially causing gameplay disruption. The method
    must properly validate packet data to prevent memory corruption or security issues.
    Ensure that bots are not overloaded with group invitations in rapid succession.
