documentation:
  brief: Initiates casting of a specified spell on a target unit within the bot's
    AI context.
  description: The DoCast method is used to execute a spell cast action by a bot AI,
    targeting a specific unit. It handles the logic for initiating the spell cast,
    including checking if the spell can be cast, managing cooldowns, and ensuring
    proper targeting. This method is typically used in bot AI scripts to perform actions
    like healing, damaging, or buffing targets. The method returns true if the spell
    casting was successfully initiated, and false otherwise. It integrates with TrinityCore's
    spell system and requires valid spell and target parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot performing the
      action. This is required for accessing AI context and managing the bot's state.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell entry in the game database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit that will be targeted by the spell. Can be nullptr,
      indicating self-targeting or no specific target.
  returns: Returns true if the spell casting was successfully initiated and queued
    for execution; returns false if the cast failed due to invalid parameters, cooldowns,
    or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Casting
    code: "if (action->DoCast(ai, 12345, target)) {\n    // Spell casting initiated\
      \ successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Self-Cast Spell
    code: "if (action->DoCast(ai, 67890, nullptr)) {\n    // Bot casts spell on itself\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore spell system and may perform
    checks such as line of sight, target validity, and spell cooldowns. It is not
    guaranteed to complete the spell cast immediately; it only initiates the process.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the database,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. Passing an invalid target pointer or nullptr
    may lead to unexpected results or crashes if not handled properly by the AI logic.
