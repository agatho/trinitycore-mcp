  class: HostileEntry
  method: GetDistanceSq
  signature: float HostileEntry::GetDistanceSq(float px, float py, float pz) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the squared distance between the hostile entry's position
    and a given point in 3D space.
  description: The GetDistanceSq method computes the squared Euclidean distance between
    the current HostileEntry's position and a specified point defined by coordinates
    (px, py, pz). This method is commonly used in AI and movement logic to determine
    proximity without computing the expensive square root operation. The result is
    returned as a float representing the squared distance, which is useful for comparisons
    where the actual distance isn't required. This approach improves performance by
    avoiding floating-point square root calculations, especially when comparing distances.
    The method does not modify any internal state of the HostileEntry object.
  parameters:
  - name: px
    description: The X coordinate of the target point in world space
  - name: py
    description: The Y coordinate of the target point in world space
  - name: pz
    description: The Z coordinate of the target point in world space
  returns: A float value representing the squared distance between the HostileEntry's
    position and the specified point (px, py, pz). The value is always non-negative.
    If the two points are identical, the return value will be zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Check
    code: "HostileEntry* entry = ...;\nfloat distanceSq = entry->GetDistanceSq(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 50.0f);\nif (distanceSq < 2500.0f) // 50 squared\n{\n    // Entry\
      \ is within 50 units\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Optimized Proximity Detection
    code: "HostileEntry* entry = ...;\nfloat playerX = player->GetPositionX();\nfloat\
      \ playerY = player->GetPositionY();\nfloat playerZ = player->GetPositionZ();\n\
      \n// Avoid sqrt for performance\nconst float attackRangeSq = 10.0f * 10.0f;\
      \ // 10 units squared\nfloat distanceSq = entry->GetDistanceSq(playerX, playerY,\
      \ playerZ);\nif (distanceSq <= attackRangeSq)\n{\n    entry->Attack(player);\
      \ // Attack if within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance by avoiding the square root calculation.
    When comparing distances, it's more efficient to compare squared distances directly
    rather than computing actual distances. The method assumes that the HostileEntry
    has a valid position set in its internal state. If the HostileEntry's position
    is not initialized or invalid, the result will be undefined.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing against squared values - ensure all values
    are squared consistently to avoid incorrect comparisons. Do not use this method
    if you specifically need the actual distance value, as it returns the square of
    the distance. In cases where the HostileEntry's position is not properly initialized,
    results may be unpredictable.
