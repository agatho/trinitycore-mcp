  method: SaveBotProfile
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::SaveBotProfile(const BotPerformanceProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Saves a bot performance profile to persistent storage for later retrieval
    and analysis.
  description: The SaveBotProfile method serializes and stores a BotPerformanceProfile
    object to the database or file system, ensuring that performance metrics and behavioral
    data collected from bots are preserved across server sessions. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining long-term analytics of bot behavior, identifying
    performance bottlenecks, and enabling post-processing of collected data for optimization
    purposes. The method typically handles serialization of profile data including
    timestamps, performance statistics, and configuration settings related to the
    bot's operation. It may also trigger additional operations such as updating related
    metadata or notifying other subsystems about new profile availability.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: The BotPerformanceProfile object containing all relevant performance
      data, metrics, and configuration details that should be persisted to storage.
      This parameter must not be null or invalid, as attempting to save an incomplete
      profile may result in data loss or corruption.
  returns: None. The method performs its operation internally and does not return
    any value.
  examples:
  - title: Saving a Bot Performance Profile
    code: 'BotPerformanceProfile myProfile;

      // ... populate profile with data ...

      botAnalytics.SaveBotProfile(myProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving Profile After Performance Monitoring
    code: 'BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      profile.timestamp = time(nullptr);

      profile.cpuUsage = GetCpuUsage();

      profile.memoryUsage = GetMemoryUsage();

      profile.uptimeSeconds = GetUptime();

      botAnalytics.SaveBotProfile(profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates synchronously and may block execution until the
    save operation completes, depending on the underlying storage mechanism. It is
    recommended to call this method during idle periods or in background threads to
    avoid impacting gameplay performance. The implementation may include transaction
    handling for data integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized profile parameter
    can lead to undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all required fields
    of the BotPerformanceProfile are properly populated before invoking this method.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method without batching operations might
    cause performance degradation due to I/O overhead.
