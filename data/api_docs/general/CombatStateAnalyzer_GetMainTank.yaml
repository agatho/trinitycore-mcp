  signature: Player * CombatStateAnalyzer::GetMainTank() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the main tank player object for the combat state analyzer.
  description: The GetMainTank method retrieves the Player object that is designated
    as the primary tank within the current combat state. This method is typically
    used in group or raid scenarios where a specific player is assigned the role of
    main tank, often for threat management, positioning, or targeting decisions. The
    returned Player pointer may be null if no main tank has been assigned or if the
    combat state does not support tank designation. This method does not modify any
    internal state and provides read-only access to the current main tank reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the main tank, or nullptr if
    no main tank is assigned or available in the current combat context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for main tank
    code: "Player* mainTank = combatAnalyzer->GetMainTank();\nif (mainTank != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with main tank-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Main\
      \ tank is: %s\", mainTank->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no main tank is assigned\n    sLog->outString(\"No main tank assigned.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance has been properly
    initialized with a valid combat context. The returned Player pointer should not
    be stored or used beyond the scope of the current combat state, as it may become
    invalid if the tank assignment changes.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer can be null, so always check for nullptr before
    using the result. Avoid storing references to the returned player across multiple
    frames or combat states without revalidation.
