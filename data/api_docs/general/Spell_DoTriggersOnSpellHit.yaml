  method: DoTriggersOnSpellHit
  signature: void Spell::DoTriggersOnSpellHit(Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Processes trigger effects when a spell successfully hits a target unit.
  description: The DoTriggersOnSpellHit method is responsible for executing any trigger
    effects that are associated with a spell upon successful hit against a target
    unit. This method typically handles the logic for applying effects such as proc-based
    abilities, aura triggers, or other conditional spell behaviors that activate when
    a spell connects with its target. It ensures that all relevant triggered spells
    or effects are properly dispatched according to game mechanics and spell properties.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was hit by the spell. This represents
      the target of the spell and is used to determine which triggers should be activated
      based on the unit's state, auras, or other conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect handling
    code: "void MySpellEffect(Spell* spell)\n{\n    Unit* target = spell->GetHitTarget();\n\
      \    if (target)\n        spell->DoTriggersOnSpellHit(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom spell logic
    code: "class CustomSpellHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleSpellHit(Spell* spell,\
      \ Unit* target)\n    {\n        // Perform primary spell effect\n        ApplyDamage(spell,\
      \ target);\n        \n        // Trigger any associated effects\n        spell->DoTriggersOnSpellHit(target);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core spell execution system
    after a spell successfully hits its target. Developers should be aware that this
    method may invoke additional spell casts or effects, potentially leading to recursive
    behavior if not handled carefully. It's important to ensure that no modifications
    to the spell or target state cause unexpected side effects during trigger processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of triggers can lead to infinite loops or stack overflows
    if triggers themselves cause the same spell to be re-triggered without proper
    safeguards. Always validate that triggers are only applied once per hit unless
    explicitly designed for multiple activations.
