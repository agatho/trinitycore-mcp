  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetStorage(uint32 type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a pointer to an integer storage array for the specified DB2 data
    type.
  description: The GetStorage method retrieves a const pointer to an internal integer
    storage array associated with a given DB2 data type. This method is typically
    used to access pre-loaded or cached data structures that represent various game
    database entries such as item templates, creature data, or other static game content.
    The returned pointer provides direct access to the underlying data without copying
    it, making it efficient for read-only operations. It's important to note that
    the returned pointer is only valid while the DB2Manager instance remains alive
    and the specific data type has not been modified or reloaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array representing the storage for the requested
    DB2 data type. Returns nullptr if the specified type is invalid or if no data
    is available for that type.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Item Template Data
    code: "const int* itemData = sDB2Manager->GetStorage(DB2_TYPE_ITEM);\nif (itemData\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use itemData to access item template information\n\
      \    // Example: int itemId = itemData[0];\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides direct memory access to internal DB2 storage. The returned
    pointer should not be modified as it points to shared, read-only data structures.
    The method assumes that the DB2Manager has already loaded the required data types
    and is thread-safe for read operations.
  warnings: Do not modify the data pointed to by the returned pointer as it represents
    shared, read-only memory. Accessing invalid or unloaded DB2 types may result in
    a nullptr return value which should be checked before use.
