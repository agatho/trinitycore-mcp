  brief: Loads and initializes area trigger teleport definitions from the database
  description: The LoadAreaTriggerTeleports method is responsible for loading all
    area trigger teleport definitions from the database into memory. This method is
    typically called during server startup or when reloading game data. It processes
    the area_trigger_teleport table entries, which define teleport locations that
    are activated by player interaction with specific area triggers. These teleports
    can be used for various purposes such as dungeon entrances, quest objectives,
    or special location transitions within the game world. The method ensures that
    all teleport definitions are properly validated and stored in internal data structures
    for quick lookup during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code\
      \ ...\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadAreaTriggerTeleports();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with other loading processes ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It's important to note that this method should only be called after
    the database connection is established and valid. The loaded area trigger teleports
    are stored in memory for fast access during gameplay, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account when dealing with large numbers of teleport definitions.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Additionally, if the database contains invalid
    or malformed area trigger teleport data, the method may silently skip those entries
    rather than throwing errors, potentially leading to missing teleport functionality
    that could be difficult to debug.
