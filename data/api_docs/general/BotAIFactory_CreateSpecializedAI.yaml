  class: BotAIFactory
  method: CreateSpecializedAI
  signature: int BotAIFactory::CreateSpecializedAI(Player * bot, const std::string
    & type)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a specialized AI instance for a bot player based on the specified
    type.
  description: The CreateSpecializedAI method initializes and assigns a specialized
    AI behavior to a given bot player. This function is typically used within the
    TrinityCore framework to dynamically configure different AI strategies for bot
    characters, such as combat behaviors, movement patterns, or quest completion logic.
    The method takes a player reference and a type string that determines which AI
    specialization should be applied. It returns an integer status code indicating
    success or failure of the operation. This functionality is essential for creating
    diverse and realistic bot behavior in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the specialized AI. Must not be null.
  - name: type
    description: String identifier specifying the type of AI specialization to create.
      Valid values are determined by the AI system implementation and may include
      types like 'combat', 'quest', 'exploration', etc.
  returns: 'Integer value representing the result of the operation: 0 for success,
    negative values for various error conditions such as invalid parameters or unsupported
    AI types.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nint result =\
      \ BotAIFactory::CreateSpecializedAI(myBot, \"combat\");\nif (result == 0) {\n\
      \    // AI successfully created\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint result = BotAIFactory::CreateSpecializedAI(bot,\
      \ \"invalid_type\");\nif (result < 0) {\n    // Handle error - invalid AI type\
      \ or other failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create specialized AI for\
      \ bot: %d\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAIFactory singleton is properly initialized
    and available. The actual AI implementation details depend on the specific AI
    modules loaded in the TrinityCore instance. Performance considerations should
    be taken into account when creating multiple AIs simultaneously, as this operation
    may involve memory allocation and initialization overhead.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the type string corresponds to a supported
    AI specialization; otherwise, the method may return an error code without creating
    any AI instance.
