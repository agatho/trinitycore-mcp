documentation:
  brief: Regenerates player runes based on elapsed time since last update.
  description: The RegenerateRunes method handles the automatic regeneration of death
    knight runes over time. It is typically called by the game loop at regular intervals
    to update rune states. The method calculates how much time has passed since the
    last rune regeneration tick and updates the cooldown timers for each rune accordingly.
    This ensures that runes gradually come off cooldown as time passes, allowing players
    to use their abilities without manual intervention. The method operates on a per-player
    basis and is part of the core gameplay mechanics for death knights in World of
    Warcraft.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    if (player)\n\
      \        player->GetRuneManager()->RegenerateRunes(diff);\n    // ... rest of\
      \ loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Update Timer
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    Unit::Update(diff);\n    if (HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_ROOTED))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Regenerate runes based on time passed\n    if\
      \ (GetRuneManager())\n        GetRuneManager()->RegenerateRunes(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called automatically by the game engine during player updates.
    It should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom game logic or testing
    scenarios. The regeneration rate follows Blizzard's official rune cooldown mechanics,
    which are typically 10 seconds per rune when fully depleted.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the game loop context as
    it may cause inconsistent rune states. Avoid calling it with incorrect time deltas
    (diff) as this can lead to unexpected rune regeneration behavior or overflow conditions.
