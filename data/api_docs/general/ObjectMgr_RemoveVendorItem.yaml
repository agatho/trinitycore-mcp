    bool persist)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a vendor item from the object manager's vendor item list
  description: The RemoveVendorItem method removes a specific item from a vendor's
    inventory in the TrinityCore database. This function is typically used when modifying
    NPC vendor configurations, such as removing items that are no longer available
    or adjusting vendor inventories during game events. The method operates on the
    entry ID of the vendor and the item ID to be removed. It supports both in-memory
    removal and persistence to the database depending on the persist flag. The function
    returns true if the item was successfully removed from the vendor's inventory,
    false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the vendor NPC from which the item will be removed
  - name: item
    description: The item ID of the item to be removed from the vendor's inventory
  - name: type
    description: The type of vendor item (typically 0 for normal items, 1 for currency
      items)
  - name: persist
    description: If true, the removal is persisted to the database; if false, only
      in-memory changes occur
  returns: Returns true if the vendor item was successfully removed from the vendor's
    inventory, false if the item was not found or could not be removed
  examples:
  - title: Remove a common weapon from a vendor
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->RemoveVendorItem(12345, 45678, 0, true)) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Weapon successfully removed from vendor.\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to remove weapon from vendor.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a currency item without persisting to database
    code: "bool success = sObjectMgr->RemoveVendorItem(54321, 98765, 1, false);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Item removed from memory only\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Currency item removed from vendor in-memory.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the ObjectMgr singleton which manages all game
    objects including NPCs and their vendors. The persist flag determines whether
    changes are written to the database immediately or deferred until a save operation.
    This function is commonly used during server maintenance, event modifications,
    or when dynamically adjusting vendor inventories.
  warnings: Removing items from vendors without proper persistence may cause issues
    if the server restarts before manual persistence occurs. Always ensure that critical
    vendor modifications are persisted to the database for long-term changes.
