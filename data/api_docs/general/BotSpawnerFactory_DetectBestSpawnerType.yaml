  class: BotSpawnerFactory
  method: DetectBestSpawnerType
  signature: SpawnerType BotSpawnerFactory::DetectBestSpawnerType()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most appropriate spawner type for bot creation
    based on current conditions and configuration.
  description: The DetectBestSpawnerType method evaluates various factors such as
    available resources, server load, and configured settings to identify the optimal
    spawner type for creating bots. This method is typically invoked during bot initialization
    or when a new bot needs to be spawned in the game world. It considers multiple
    potential spawner types (e.g., NPC-based, GameObject-based, or custom) and selects
    the one that best fits the current environment and requirements. The selection
    process may involve checking for existing spawners, resource availability, and
    performance constraints to ensure efficient bot deployment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpawnerType enum value indicating the detected best spawner type.
    Possible values include NPC_SPAWNER, GAMEOBJECT_SPAWNER, CUSTOM_SPAWNER, or INVALID_SPAWNER
    if no suitable type is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpawnerType type = botSpawnerFactory.DetectBestSpawnerType();\nif (type\
      \ != INVALID_SPAWNER) {\n    // Proceed with spawning using the detected spawner\
      \ type\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks to determine the best spawner
    type but does not actually spawn any bots. It's designed to be called frequently
    without significant performance impact.
