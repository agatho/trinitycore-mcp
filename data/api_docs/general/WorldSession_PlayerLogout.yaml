  signature: bool WorldSession::PlayerLogout() const
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the player logout process for the session's associated character.
  description: The PlayerLogout method handles the core logic required to gracefully
    log out a player from the game world. It ensures that all necessary cleanup operations
    are performed, such as saving the player's state, removing them from the active
    world players list, and sending appropriate network messages to notify the client
    of the logout sequence. This method is typically invoked when a player chooses
    to log out or when the session is being terminated. The method returns true if
    the logout process was successfully initiated, and false otherwise, which may
    occur if the player is already in the process of logging out or if there are issues
    with the session state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player logout process was successfully initiated; otherwise,
    returns false if the operation failed due to invalid session state or other internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (session->PlayerLogout()) {\n    // Logout process started successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player logout initiated.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to initiate logout\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initiate player logout.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly close the network connection or destroy the
    session object. It merely starts the logout sequence, which may involve asynchronous
    operations such as saving character data to the database. The actual disconnection
    of the player from the server typically occurs after this method completes.
  warnings: Calling this method while a player is already in the process of logging
    out can lead to undefined behavior or errors. It should only be invoked once per
    session during a valid logout sequence. Additionally, ensure that no other operations
    are modifying the player's state concurrently when this method is called.
