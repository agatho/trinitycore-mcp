  signature: void Player::UpdateTavernRestingState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's tavern resting state to reflect current in-game conditions.
  description: The UpdateTavernRestingState method manages the internal state of a
    player regarding their resting status in a tavern. This method is typically invoked
    when a player enters or exits a tavern area, or when their rest state changes
    due to game mechanics such as completing a rest period or being interrupted from
    resting. It ensures that the player's UI and game state accurately reflect whether
    they are currently resting in a tavern, which affects various gameplay elements
    including experience gain rates, spell cooldowns, and quest progression. The method
    does not directly perform any visual updates but rather synchronizes internal
    flags and states used by the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->UpdateTavernRestingState();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core game loop when player
    state changes occur. Developers should not typically need to invoke this method
    manually unless implementing custom tavern-related behavior or debugging resting
    mechanics.
