  signature: void Unit::RemoveUnitFlag3(UnitFlags3 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified unit flags from a Unit object, effectively disabling certain
    behavioral attributes or states.
  description: The RemoveUnitFlag3 method is used to strip specific flags from a Unit
    object, which typically represents a creature, player, or NPC within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method allows developers to remove flags that may affect how the
    unit behaves in various game contexts, such as combat, movement, or interaction
    with other players or NPCs. It is commonly used during dynamic updates or when
    modifying unit states for gameplay balance or scripting purposes. The method operates
    on a UnitFlags3 enum type, which defines a set of possible flags that can be removed
    from the unit object.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitFlags3 enum value representing the specific flags to be removed
      from the unit. This parameter defines which flags will be stripped from the
      unit's current state, allowing for precise control over the unit's behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* targetUnit = GetUnit();


      // Remove a specific flag from the unit

      targetUnit->RemoveUnitFlag3(UnitFlags3::UNIT_FLAG_NOT_ATTACKABLE);


      // The unit will no longer be flagged as not attackable'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: '// Remove multiple flags from a unit

      Unit* targetUnit = GetUnit();


      // Remove flags for both combat and movement

      targetUnit->RemoveUnitFlag3(UnitFlags3::UNIT_FLAG_UNK1 | UnitFlags3::UNIT_FLAG_UNK2);


      // The unit will no longer be flagged as having those specific behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddUnitFlag3 to manage
    unit states dynamically. It should be noted that removing flags does not necessarily
    reset the unit's state to default; it simply removes the specified flags from
    the current state. Performance considerations are minimal, but care must be taken
    when modifying flags during active combat or movement scenarios.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in unit interactions,
    especially if flags are removed while the unit is actively engaged in combat or
    movement. Developers should ensure that flag removal aligns with intended game
    mechanics and does not cause unintended side effects.
