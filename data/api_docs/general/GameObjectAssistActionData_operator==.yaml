documentation:
  brief: Compares two GameObjectAssistActionData objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    GameObjectAssistActionData instance and another GameObjectAssistActionData object.
    It returns true if all corresponding members of both objects are equal, and false
    otherwise. This comparison is typically used to determine if two game object assist
    action data structures represent the same configuration or state. The method is
    const, meaning it does not modify either object during comparison. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this operator allows for efficient determination of
    whether two assist action configurations are identical, which can be useful for
    caching, duplicate detection, or synchronization purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The GameObjectAssistActionData object to compare against this instance.
  returns: True if all members of both GameObjectAssistActionData objects are equal;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two GameObjectAssistActionData objects
    code: 'GameObjectAssistActionData data1;

      GameObjectAssistActionData data2;

      bool isEqual = (data1 == data2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      member values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in conditional logic for AI behavior
    code: "GameObjectAssistActionData currentAction;\nGameObjectAssistActionData previousAction;\n\
      \nif (currentAction == previousAction)\n{\n    // No change in assist action\
      \ configuration, skip reinitialization\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with updating\
      \ AI behavior based on new action data"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely compares all member variables of the GameObjectAssistActionData
    structure. This operator is essential for efficient comparison operations in AI
    systems where duplicate configurations need to be detected. Performance-wise,
    the comparison should be fast as it's typically a simple member-wise equality
    check.
