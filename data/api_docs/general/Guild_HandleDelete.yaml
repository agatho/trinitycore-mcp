documentation:
  brief: Deletes the guild associated with the player's session.
  description: The HandleDelete method is responsible for processing a guild deletion
    request from a player's session. It verifies that the player has the necessary
    permissions to delete the guild, typically requiring the player to be the guild
    leader or have administrative privileges. Once validated, the method proceeds
    to remove all guild-related data from the database and notifies other guild members
    of the guild's dissolution. This includes removing guild members, guild ranks,
    guild events, and any associated guild banks. The method ensures that the guild
    is completely removed from the game world and that no references to it remain
    in memory or persistent storage.

  - title: Basic Guild Deletion
    code: "void DeleteGuildCommand(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    Guild* guild = session->GetPlayer()->GetGuild();\n\
      \    if (guild)\n    {\n        guild->HandleDelete(session);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's session is properly authenticated and
    that the guild object is valid. The actual deletion process involves multiple
    database transactions, so performance may be impacted on servers with many active
    guilds. The method does not handle the case where a player attempts to delete
    a guild they do not own; this would typically be caught by permission checks before
    this method is called.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper validation can result in data
    corruption or inconsistent state in the game world. It should only be invoked
    when it's certain that the player has the right to delete the guild. Additionally,
    this operation cannot be undone and will permanently remove all guild data.
