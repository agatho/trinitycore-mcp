  class: BattlePetManager
  method: SetActiveTeam
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::SetActiveTeam(int * player, const std::string
    & teamName)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active battle pet team for a player.
  description: The SetActiveTeam method assigns a specified battle pet team to a player,
    making it the currently active team that will be used in battles. This method
    updates the player's active team configuration within the BattlePetManager system.
    The operation requires a valid player reference and an existing team name. If
    successful, the team becomes active immediately for the player's next battle encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must be a valid pointer to an integer value.
  - name: teamName
    description: String containing the name of the battle pet team to activate. The
      team must already exist for the player.
  returns: Returns true if the team was successfully set as active, false otherwise.
    This could fail if the player does not exist, the team name is invalid, or the
    team is not owned by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Set Active Team for Player
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nstd::string teamName = \"MyBattleTeam\";\nbool result\
      \ = battlePetManager.SetActiveTeam(&playerId, teamName);\nif (result) {\n  \
      \  // Team successfully activated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's active battle pet team state.
    It is typically called when a player selects or switches teams in their pet collection
    interface.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided player ID points to an actual logged-in player,
    and that the team name corresponds to an existing team owned by that player. Using
    invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior or silent failures.
