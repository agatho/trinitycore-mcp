documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets all prerequisites for accepting a quest
  description: The HasPrerequisites method evaluates whether a player has satisfied
    all necessary conditions to accept a specific quest. This includes checking for
    required previous quests, minimum level requirements, faction standing, and other
    prerequisite conditions defined in the quest template. The method is typically
    called during quest acceptance flow to validate that the player is eligible to
    take on the quest. It returns true if all prerequisites are met, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID to check prerequisites
      for. Must be a valid quest identifier present in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if all prerequisites for the specified quest are satisfied
    by the player, false if any prerequisite is not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest prerequisites
    code: "if (questManager->HasPrerequisites(&questId)) {\n    // Player can accept\
      \ the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ accept the quest due to unmet prerequisites\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and condition checks that could
    have performance implications if called frequently. It should only be invoked
    when necessary, such as during quest acceptance validation.
  warnings: Ensure the quest ID passed is valid and exists in the database; passing
    an invalid ID may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes the
    player object has been properly initialized with current state information.
