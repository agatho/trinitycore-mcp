  class: InterruptManager
  method: ShouldLetOthersInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::ShouldLetOthersInterrupt(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether another player can interrupt the current spell casting
    of the specified target.
  description: The ShouldLetOthersInterrupt method evaluates whether a target entity
    is currently in a state where other players are allowed to interrupt their spell
    casting. This decision is typically based on factors such as the target's current
    spell state, combat status, and game rules regarding spell interruption. The method
    returns true if interruptions are permitted, and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used in the context of spell mechanics and player interactions within TrinityCore's
    core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if other players are allowed to interrupt the target's current
    spell casting; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interruption logic
    code: "if (interruptManager.ShouldLetOthersInterrupt(target)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ other players to interrupt this target\n    target.InterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal spell state tracking and may be
    called during combat or spell casting events. It is part of the core interruption
    system that governs how spells behave when interrupted by external actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target object passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized, as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the spell interruption logic.
