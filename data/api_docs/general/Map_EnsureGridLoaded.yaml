  class: Map
  method: EnsureGridLoaded
  signature: bool Map::EnsureGridLoaded(const int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a grid into memory if it is not already loaded for the specified map.
  description: The EnsureGridLoaded method ensures that a specific grid on the map
    is loaded and ready for use. This is particularly important in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment where maps are divided into grids for efficient memory
    management and performance. The method checks whether the grid corresponding to
    the provided parameter is already loaded, and if not, it triggers the loading
    process. It is commonly used when objects or players need to interact with a specific
    area that may not yet be initialized in memory. This method helps maintain the
    integrity of the game world by ensuring all necessary grid data is available before
    operations are performed on that region.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer representing the grid identifier or coordinate value used
      to determine which grid should be loaded. The exact meaning depends on the internal
      grid indexing system of the map, typically corresponding to grid X or Y coordinates.
  returns: Returns true if the grid was successfully loaded or was already loaded
    before the call; returns false if the loading process failed or if invalid parameters
    were provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Grid Loading
    code: "Map* map = ...;\nint gridX = 5;\nbool result = map->EnsureGridLoaded(gridX);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Grid is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Grid Load Status Before Object Placement
    code: "Map* map = ...;\nint gridY = 10;\nif (!map->EnsureGridLoaded(gridY)) {\n\
      \    // Handle failure case, e.g., log error or delay placement\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load grid %d on map %u\", gridY, map->GetId());\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with object placement or other operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal grid management system in TrinityCore
    and should be used carefully to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. It may trigger
    asynchronous loading depending on how the server is configured, so calling code
    should account for potential delays or non-blocking behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or out-of-bounds grid coordinates can
    result in undefined behavior or errors. Always validate input parameters before
    invoking EnsureGridLoaded to prevent crashes or inconsistent map states.
