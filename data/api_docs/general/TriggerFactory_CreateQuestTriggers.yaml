  brief: Creates and initializes quest-related triggers for the game world
  description: The CreateQuestTriggers method is responsible for generating and setting
    up all trigger objects associated with quests in the TrinityCore emulator. This
    method typically iterates through the existing quest database, identifies quest-specific
    trigger conditions, and instantiates appropriate trigger entities that will activate
    when players meet the necessary criteria. The method ensures proper linkage between
    quest states and trigger events, enabling dynamic gameplay mechanics such as objective
    completion, NPC interactions, and reward delivery. It may also handle cleanup
    of obsolete triggers and synchronization of trigger states with current quest
    progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of quest triggers successfully
    created and initialized. A return value of zero indicates no triggers were created,
    while negative values typically denote errors during the creation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int triggerCount = TriggerFactory::CreateQuestTriggers();\nif (triggerCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully created %d quest triggers\", triggerCount);\n\
      }\nelse if (triggerCount == 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No quest triggers were\
      \ created\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create quest triggers,\
      \ error code: %d\", triggerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    loading new quest data. It may perform database queries and memory allocations,
    so it's recommended to call it during low-traffic periods. The method assumes
    that the quest system is already initialized and that all necessary database connections
    are active.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate triggers or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing trigger data is properly
    cleared before invoking this method. This method may block execution during database
    operations, so it should not be called from time-critical code paths.
