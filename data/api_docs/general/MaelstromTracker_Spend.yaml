  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: Spend
  signature: void MaelstromTracker::Spend(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the stored Maelstrom energy amount by the specified value.
  description: The Spend method decreases the current Maelstrom energy stored within
    the MaelstromTracker instance by the provided amount. This method is typically
    used when a player consumes Maelstrom energy for abilities or effects that require
    its expenditure. The method ensures that the energy cannot drop below zero, maintaining
    data integrity. It does not return any value and operates directly on the internal
    energy counter of the tracker.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of Maelstrom energy to be spent. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the energy units to deduct from the current stored amount.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MaelstromTracker tracker;

      tracker.Spend(50);

      // Reduces the Maelstrom energy by 50 units.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Spend with Conditional Check
    code: "MaelstromTracker tracker;\nuint32 requiredEnergy = 100;\nif (tracker.GetAmount()\
      \ >= requiredEnergy)\n{\n    tracker.Spend(requiredEnergy);\n    // Energy successfully\
      \ spent\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough energy available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with abilities that consume Maelstrom
    energy, such as those found in the Enhancement Shaman spec. The internal state
    of the tracker is modified directly without any external event notifications.
