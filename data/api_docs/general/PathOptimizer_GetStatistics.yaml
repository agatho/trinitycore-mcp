  class: PathOptimizer
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: void PathOptimizer::GetStatistics(uint32 & pathsOptimized, uint32 & pointsRemoved,
    float & averageReduction) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves optimization statistics from the path optimizer, including number
    of paths optimized, points removed, and average reduction percentage.
  description: 'The GetStatistics method provides detailed information about the performance
    of the PathOptimizer class by returning three key metrics: the total number of
    paths that have been optimized, the cumulative number of waypoints or points that
    were removed during optimization, and the average percentage reduction achieved
    per path. This method is typically used for monitoring and debugging pathfinding
    algorithms within the TrinityCore framework. The statistics are updated each time
    a path is optimized using the PathOptimizer''s internal processing functions.
    The method does not modify any internal state and can be safely called multiple
    times to retrieve current optimization metrics.'
  parameters:
  - name: pathsOptimized
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the total
      number of paths successfully optimized by this PathOptimizer instance.
  - name: pointsRemoved
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the cumulative
      count of waypoints or points removed across all optimized paths.
  - name: averageReduction
    description: Reference to a float variable that will be filled with the average
      percentage reduction achieved per path (e.g., 15.5f for 15.5% average reduction).
  returns: null

    code: "PathOptimizer optimizer;\n// ... perform some optimizations ...\nuint32\
      \ pathsOptimized = 0;\nuint32 pointsRemoved = 0;\nfloat averageReduction = 0.0f;\n\
      optimizer.GetStatistics(pathsOptimized, pointsRemoved, averageReduction);\n\

    code: "void MonitorPathOptimizer(PathOptimizer& optimizer) {\n    uint32 pathsOptimized\
      \ = 0;\n    uint32 pointsRemoved = 0;\n    float averageReduction = 0.0f;\n\

      );\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and does not perform any heavy
    computations. It simply reads pre-calculated statistics that are maintained internally
    by the PathOptimizer class. The values returned are cumulative since the optimizer
    was initialized or last reset, unless otherwise specified by implementation details.
