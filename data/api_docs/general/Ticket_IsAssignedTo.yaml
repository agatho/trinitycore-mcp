  signature: bool Ticket::IsAssignedTo(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the ticket is assigned to a specific player by GUID.
  description: The IsAssignedTo method determines if a ticket has been assigned to
    a particular player identified by their global unique identifier (GUID). This
    method is commonly used in the TrinityCore's ticketing system to verify assignment
    status before performing operations such as updating or resolving tickets. The
    check typically involves comparing the provided GUID against the internal assignment
    record stored within the ticket object. This functionality supports game master
    workflows where tickets need to be managed and tracked by specific administrators.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check assignment
      status against.
  returns: Returns true if the ticket is currently assigned to the specified player
    GUID, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (ticket->IsAssignedTo(playerGuid)) {\n    // Ticket is assigned to this\
      \ player\n    // Perform actions specific to assigned tickets\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Assignment Check
    code: "uint32 targetPlayerGuid = 12345;\nif (ticket->IsAssignedTo(targetPlayerGuid))\
      \ {\n    sLog->outString(\"Ticket is assigned to player %u.\", targetPlayerGuid);\n\
      } else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Ticket is not assigned to player %u.\", targetPlayerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple equality check against an internal GUID field.
    It does not involve database queries or network calls, making it efficient for
    frequent checks within game logic.
