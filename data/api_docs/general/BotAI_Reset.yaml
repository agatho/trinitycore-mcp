  class: BotAI
  method: Reset
  signature: void BotAI::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the bot's AI state and clears all active behaviors.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the BotAI instance by
    clearing any existing AI states, stopping current actions, and preparing the bot
    for a fresh AI cycle. This method is typically called when a bot needs to be restarted
    or reconfigured, such as after a disconnect, during a bot switch, or when transitioning
    between different AI modes. It ensures that all internal AI flags, timers, and
    behavior queues are cleared before the bot resumes normal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Reconfiguration
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();

      botAI->Reset();

      botAI->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::FOLLOW);

      botAI->Start();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before reconfiguring a bot's behavior to ensure
    clean state. It does not affect the bot's character data or inventory, only the
    AI-related internal state.
  warnings: Calling Reset while the bot is actively performing actions may interrupt
    ongoing tasks without proper cleanup. Ensure that any active behaviors are safely
    stopped before calling this method.
