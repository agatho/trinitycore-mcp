  signature: bool BotSession::HasSocket() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session has an active socket connection.
  description: The HasSocket method determines if the BotSession object currently
    maintains an active network socket connection. This is typically used to verify
    that the bot is properly connected to the game server and can communicate with
    it. The method returns true if a valid socket connection exists, and false otherwise.
    This check is important for ensuring that bot operations are only performed when
    the session is fully established and functional.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session has an active socket connection; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Socket Check
    code: "if (botSession.HasSocket()) {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n   \
      \ botSession.ExecuteCommand(\"move forward\");\n} else {\n    // Handle disconnected\
      \ state\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot is not connected to server.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically performs a lightweight check on the internal socket
    state without making additional network calls. It's commonly used in bot logic
    loops to ensure connectivity before executing commands.
