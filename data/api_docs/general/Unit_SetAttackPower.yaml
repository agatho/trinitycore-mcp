  class: Unit
  method: SetAttackPower
  signature: void Unit::SetAttackPower(int32 attackPower)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the attack power value for the unit.
  description: This method allows setting the attack power attribute of a Unit object,
    which determines the base damage dealt by melee attacks. The attack power value
    directly influences the damage calculation for physical attacks and is used in
    conjunction with weapon speed and other factors to determine final damage output.
    This method is typically used during initialization or when modifying unit attributes
    for gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPower
    description: The attack power value to set for the unit. This value represents
      the base attack power that will be applied to melee attacks, affecting damage
      calculation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      target->SetAttackPower(100);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetAttackPower(500);

      // This will affect the damage calculation for player''s melee attacks

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method likely updates internal data structures
    related to attack power, and may trigger recalculations of damage values. Performance
    considerations: Setting attack power should be done carefully as it can affect
    combat calculations. Thread safety: This method is typically not thread-safe and
    should be used in single-threaded contexts.'
  warnings: This method should only be called when the unit is initialized or during
    gameplay balance adjustments. Incorrect usage may lead to inaccurate damage calculations
    or game imbalance.
