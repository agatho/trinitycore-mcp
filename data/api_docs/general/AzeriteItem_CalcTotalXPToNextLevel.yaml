  class: AzeriteItem
  method: CalcTotalXPToNextLevel
  signature: int AzeriteItem::CalcTotalXPToNextLevel(int level, int knowledgeLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total amount of experience required to reach the next Azerite
    level based on current level and knowledge level.
  description: The CalcTotalXPToNextLevel method computes the cumulative experience
    points needed to advance from the provided Azerite item level to the next level.
    This calculation takes into account both the current level of the Azerite item
    and its associated knowledge level, which affects how much experience is required
    for progression. The method is typically used in the context of Azerite armor
    progression mechanics within World of Warcraft, where players must accumulate
    experience to unlock new powers and abilities. It serves as a helper function
    for determining progression requirements during Azerite item upgrades.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the Azerite item. Must be a positive integer
      representing the stage of Azerite progression.
  - name: knowledgeLevel
    description: The knowledge level associated with the Azerite item. This determines
      how much experience is required for advancement and typically ranges from 0
      to a maximum defined by game mechanics.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total experience points required
    to advance the Azerite item to the next level. The return value will be zero or
    positive, with higher values indicating more experience is needed for progression.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate XP for next Azerite level
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = ...;

      int currentLevel = 10;

      int knowledgeLevel = 5;

      int xpRequired = item->CalcTotalXPToNextLevel(currentLevel, knowledgeLevel);

      // xpRequired now contains the experience needed to advance from level 10 to
      11'
    language: cpp
  - title: Progression check using calculated XP
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = ...;\nint currentLevel = 25;\nint knowledgeLevel =\
      \ 3;\nint totalXP = item->CalcTotalXPToNextLevel(currentLevel, knowledgeLevel);\n\
      if (player->GetAzeriteXP() >= totalXP) {\n    // Player can advance Azerite\
      \ level\n    item->UpgradeLevel();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger progression system that includes experience
    tracking, level validation, and power unlocking. The exact formula for XP calculation
    may be hardcoded or derived from internal tables in the TrinityCore codebase.
    It's important to note that this method does not modify any state; it only calculates
    and returns values.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid positive integers before calling
    this method, as invalid inputs could lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected
    behavior. The method assumes that Azerite item levels follow a consistent progression
    pattern, which may not hold true in all edge cases or custom server configurations.
