documentation:
  brief: Updates the follow state and behavior of a SmartAI-controlled creature based
    on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateFollow method is responsible for managing the follow behavior
    of a creature controlled by SmartAI. It processes the time delta (diff) to determine
    if the creature should adjust its position, maintain distance from the target,
    or perform any related actions during the follow state. This method is typically
    called during the AI update cycle and ensures that the creature follows its target
    properly according to defined smart AI rules and conditions.

  - title: Basic UpdateFollow Call
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    m_creature->GetSmartAI()->UpdateFollow(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI update loop and should not be called
    directly from outside the SmartAI framework. It relies on the creature's current
    follow target and state to determine behavior.
