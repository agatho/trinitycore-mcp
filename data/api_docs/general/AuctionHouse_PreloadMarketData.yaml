  signature: void AuctionHouse::PreloadMarketData(const int & itemIds)
documentation:
  brief: Preloads auction house market data for specified item IDs to optimize performance
    and reduce database queries during auction operations.
  description: The PreloadMarketData method is designed to cache or load relevant
    market data for a list of item identifiers into memory, typically before performing
    bulk auction-related operations. This helps minimize the number of database hits
    required when processing auctions, especially in high-traffic scenarios such as
    auction house browsing or item listing. The method likely initializes internal
    caches or prepares lookup tables that store pricing trends, item availability,
    and other market-related information for the specified items. It is commonly used
    during server startup, periodic data refreshes, or when handling large batches
    of auction activities to improve responsiveness and reduce latency.
  parameters:
  - name: itemIds
    description: A reference to a collection (likely vector or array) of integer item
      identifiers for which market data should be preloaded. Each ID corresponds to
      an entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Preload market data for specific items
    code: 'std::vector<int> items = {12345, 67890, 54321};

      AuctionHouse ah;

      ah.PreloadMarketData(items);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Preloading during server initialization
    code: "void InitializeAuctionHouse()\n{\n    std::vector<int> commonItems = {1001,\
      \ 1002, 1003, 2001, 2002};\n    AuctionHouse ah;\n    ah.PreloadMarketData(commonItems);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for batch operations and may perform asynchronous
    loading or caching in the background to avoid blocking main game threads. It should
    be called with a reasonable number of item IDs to balance between performance
    gains and memory usage. The internal implementation might involve database queries,
    cache invalidation, or interaction with other subsystems like the ItemCache.
  warnings: Calling this method with an excessively large list of item IDs could lead
    to performance degradation due to memory pressure or blocking operations. Ensure
    that item ID lists are filtered appropriately before calling to avoid unnecessary
    overhead.
