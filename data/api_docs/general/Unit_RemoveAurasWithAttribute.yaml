  class: Unit
  method: RemoveAurasWithAttribute
  signature: void Unit::RemoveAurasWithAttribute(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras from the unit that have the specified attribute flag.
  description: This method removes all aura applications from the Unit that possess
    the given attribute flag. It is commonly used to strip specific types of buffs
    or debuffs from a unit, such as those with the 'AuraType' attribute. The method
    operates on the unit's aura list and will remove all matching auras without distinction
    of duration or other factors. This functionality is essential for managing unit
    status effects in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing with complex spell
    mechanics or when implementing custom game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The attribute flag to match against auras. This represents the specific
      attribute that auras must possess to be removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove all auras with the 'AuraType' attribute
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      uint32 flags = 1;

      target->RemoveAurasWithAttribute(flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related methods
    like RemoveAurasByType or RemoveAurasWithMechanic. Performance considerations
    include the potential for multiple removals, especially when dealing with large
    numbers of auras. The method is thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications
    to the unit's aura list occur.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can remove all auras matching
    the specified attribute flag, potentially removing important buffs or debuffs
    that may affect gameplay mechanics. Be cautious when using this in scenarios where
    specific aura removals are required.
