  signature: void Player::RemoveItemDurations(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Removes item duration tracking for a specified item from the player's inventory.
  description: This method removes the item duration tracking associated with a given
    item from the player's inventory. It is typically used when an item is removed
    or destroyed, ensuring that the item's duration timer is properly cleared and
    no longer affects gameplay mechanics. The method handles the removal of item durations
    from the player's active item timers, which may include cooldowns, consumable
    effects, or other time-based mechanics. This function is essential for maintaining
    proper game state when items are modified or removed from a player's inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to the Item object whose duration tracking should be removed.
      The item must be valid and currently in the player's inventory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);

      player->RemoveItemDurations(item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple items
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    Item*\
      \ item = player->GetItemByGuid(i);\n    player->RemoveItemDurations(item);\n\
      }\n// Removes duration tracking for multiple items"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when items
    are removed from inventory, such as during item destruction or when a player's
    inventory changes. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like RemoveItem
    or RemoveItemFromInventory to ensure complete removal of item tracking.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect duration tracking and
    potentially affect gameplay mechanics related to cooldowns, consumables, or time-based
    effects. Care should be taken when calling this method on items not currently
    in the player's inventory.
