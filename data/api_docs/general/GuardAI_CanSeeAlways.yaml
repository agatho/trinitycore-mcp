  class: GuardAI
  method: CanSeeAlways
  signature: bool GuardAI::CanSeeAlways(const int * obj)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a guard AI can see a specific object under all circumstances.
  description: The CanSeeAlways method in the GuardAI class evaluates whether a guard
    AI unit can perceive a given object regardless of normal visibility constraints.
    This method is typically used to ensure that guards maintain awareness of important
    targets or objects within their designated areas, even when standard line-of-sight
    checks would prevent detection. It may be invoked during AI decision-making processes
    to override typical visual limitations for guard behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the object identifier or type.
      This parameter is expected to reference a specific game object such as a player,
      creature, or item that the guard AI attempts to observe.
  returns: Returns true if the guard AI can see the specified object under all circumstances,
    false otherwise. The result indicates whether visibility is guaranteed regardless
    of environmental factors or standard detection rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in guard AI logic
    code: "if (guardAI->CanSeeAlways(&targetPlayerGuid)) {\n    // Guard will engage\
      \ target immediately\n    guardAI->AttackStart(targetPlayer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking visibility of a critical object
    code: "uint32 objectId = 12345;\nif (guardAI->CanSeeAlways(&objectId)) {\n   \
      \ // Perform action based on guaranteed visibility\n    guardAI->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely bypasses standard field-of-view and obstruction checks,
    making it useful for critical AI behaviors where awareness must be absolute. Developers
    should consider performance implications if this function is called frequently
    during AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'obj' represents a valid game object
    identifier; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or cause crashes. This method
    may not account for stealth or invisibility effects applied to the target object.
