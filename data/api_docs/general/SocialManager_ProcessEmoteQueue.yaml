documentation:
  brief: Processes queued emotes for all players in the social manager.
  description: The ProcessEmoteQueue method handles the execution of emote actions
    that have been queued for players within the SocialManager. It iterates through
    the emote queue and processes each emote based on its type and timing, ensuring
    proper synchronization with the game loop. This method is typically called during
    the update cycle to maintain smooth gameplay behavior for social interactions
    such as emotes, gestures, or other player animations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other updates...\n  \
      \  sSocialMgr->ProcessEmoteQueue(diff);\n    // Other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly from the game update loop.
    It manages emote timing and ensures that emotes are executed in a timely manner
    without blocking the main thread. The implementation may involve checking for
    cooldowns, validating emote conditions, and sending appropriate packets to clients.
