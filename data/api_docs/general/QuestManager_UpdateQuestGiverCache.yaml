  signature: void QuestManager::UpdateQuestGiverCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal cache of quest givers in the QuestManager.
  description: The UpdateQuestGiverCache method refreshes the internal data structure
    that tracks available quest givers within the game world. This ensures that the
    QuestManager has up-to-date information about which NPCs can provide quests, including
    their current quest availability and state. The method is typically invoked when
    quest giver data may have changed, such as after a quest is completed or when
    a new quest is added to an NPC's quest list. It helps maintain consistency between
    the game world state and the quest system's internal tracking mechanisms.

    code: 'QuestManager* qm = sObjectAccessor->GetQuestManager();

      qm->UpdateQuestGiverCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core systems when quest data
    changes. Developers should not need to invoke this manually unless implementing
    custom quest logic or debugging quest-related issues.
