documentation:
  brief: Breaks the link between a group instance reference and its target object.
  description: The targetObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for removing or invalidating
    the connection between a GroupInstanceReference object and its associated target
    object. This typically occurs when the target object is being destroyed or removed
    from the game world, ensuring that the reference does not become a dangling pointer.
    The method likely updates internal tracking mechanisms to prevent access to invalid
    memory locations and maintains the integrity of group instance management systems
    within TrinityCore. It is commonly invoked during object cleanup routines or when
    handling destruction events in group-based content such as raids or dungeons.

  - title: Basic Usage During Object Cleanup
    code: "void SomeGroupInstance::OnTargetObjectDestroy()\n{\n    m_groupReference->targetObjectDestroyLink();\n\
      \    // Further cleanup logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the target object is about to be destroyed
    or has already been destroyed. Calling it prematurely may lead to inconsistent
    state in group instance tracking systems. The implementation likely involves clearing
    internal pointers, notifying other subsystems of the link disruption, and potentially
    triggering cleanup routines.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation can result in undefined
    behavior if the target object is still active or referenced elsewhere. It's crucial
    to ensure that no other code attempts to access the target object after this call
    has been made.
