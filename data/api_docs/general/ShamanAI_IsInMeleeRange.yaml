  class: ShamanAI
  method: IsInMeleeRange
  signature: bool ShamanAI::IsInMeleeRange(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the shaman AI target is within melee attack range.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if the current target of the ShamanAI
    instance is within the melee combat range. This is a crucial check for determining
    when a shaman should use melee abilities or switch to ranged attacks. The method
    internally calculates the distance between the shaman and its target, comparing
    it against the shaman's melee range threshold. It returns true if the target is
    close enough for melee attacks, false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for proper AI behavior in combat scenarios, particularly for shaman classes that
    may have both melee and ranged capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position.
      The method uses this value to determine the target's location for range calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the target is within melee range of the shaman AI, false
    otherwise. The return value indicates whether a melee attack can be executed successfully
    against the current target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "if (shamanAI->IsInMeleeRange(&targetId)) {\n    // Execute melee ability\n\
      \    shamanAI->DoMeleeAttack();\n} else {\n    // Switch to ranged attack\n\
      \    shamanAI->CastSpell(SPELL_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with target validation
    code: "int targetId = shamanAI->GetTarget();\nif (targetId != 0 && shamanAI->IsInMeleeRange(&targetId))\
      \ {\n    // Ensure target exists and is in melee range before attacking\n  \
      \  shamanAI->AttackStart();\n} else if (targetId != 0) {\n    // Target out\
      \ of melee range, use appropriate spell\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(SPELL_EARTH_SHOCK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance calculations based on the shaman's
    current position and the target's position. The exact melee range value may depend
    on the specific shaman specialization or gear. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight
    check that should not significantly impact AI processing time.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid target before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also
    note that this method does not account for obstacles or line of sight - it only
    checks distance.
