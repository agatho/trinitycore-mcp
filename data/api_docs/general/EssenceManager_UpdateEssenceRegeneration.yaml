documentation:
  brief: Updates the regeneration state of essence for all players in the manager's
    scope.
  description: The UpdateEssenceRegeneration method handles the periodic update of
    essence regeneration for all active players managed by this EssenceManager instance.
    This method is typically called during game ticks or time-based intervals to process
    and apply essence regeneration mechanics. It iterates through all registered players,
    evaluates their current essence state, applies any applicable regeneration rates,
    and updates their essence values accordingly. The method ensures that essence
    regeneration respects player-specific modifiers, environmental factors, and game
    rules such as cooldowns or restrictions on rapid regeneration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static EssenceManager essenceMgr;\n    // ... other\
      \ game logic ...\n    essenceMgr.UpdateEssenceRegeneration();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Time-Based Updates
    code: "class EssenceSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n    {\n\
      \        if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n        {\n            m_essenceManager.UpdateEssenceRegeneration();\n\
      \            m_updateTimer = ESSENCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL;\n        }\n        else\n\
      \        {\n            m_updateTimer -= diff;\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n\
      \    EssenceManager m_essenceManager;\n    uint32 m_updateTimer = ESSENCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate essence state
    for players. It is designed to be thread-safe when used with proper synchronization
    mechanisms. The implementation assumes that player essence data is already initialized
    and valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game thread without proper
    synchronization, as it may cause race conditions in player essence updates. Ensure
    all players are properly registered with the manager before invoking this method.
