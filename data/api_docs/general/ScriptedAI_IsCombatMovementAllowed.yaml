  class: ScriptedAI
  method: IsCombatMovementAllowed
  signature: bool ScriptedAI::IsCombatMovementAllowed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether combat movement is allowed for the AI-controlled creature.
  description: The IsCombatMovementAllowed method checks if the ScriptedAI instance
    permits its associated creature to move during combat. This flag controls whether
    the creature can perform movement actions such as chasing enemies or repositioning
    while engaged in combat. The method returns true if movement is allowed, and false
    otherwise. This functionality is typically used by AI scripts to control how creatures
    behave in combat situations, especially when implementing custom combat behaviors
    or restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether combat movement is currently
    allowed (true) or prohibited (false).
  examples:
  - title: Check Combat Movement Allowance Before Moving
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->IsCombatMovementAllowed())\n{\n    me->GetAI()->DoStartMovement(target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where movement is not allowed\n    me->GetAI()->AttackStart(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other AI control methods
    to implement complex combat behaviors. The default implementation typically returns
    true unless explicitly disabled by the AI script or creature template settings.
