  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: ResetCoordinationState
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ResetCoordinationState(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the coordination state for a specified group within an instance.
  description: The ResetCoordinationState method clears or reinitializes the current
    coordination data associated with a given group inside a dungeon or raid instance.
    This typically occurs when a group is disbanded, members leave, or a new instance
    is started. The method ensures that any previous state information related to
    group synchronization, instance timers, or shared objectives is cleared to prevent
    conflicts or stale data during subsequent group activities within the same or
    different instances.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination state will be reset.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid group currently in an instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Coordination State for a Group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    sInstanceCoordination->ResetCoordinationState(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore instance management
    system when group changes occur. It does not directly affect player positions
    or instance data, but rather cleans up coordination-related metadata.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and belongs to an active
    instance before calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
