  class: TankPositioning
  method: CalculateThreatAngle
  signature: float TankPositioning::CalculateThreatAngle(const int & tankPos, const
    int & targetPos, const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the threat angle between a tank's position and a target within
    a group.
  description: The CalculateThreatAngle method computes the angular relationship between
    a tank's current position and a target's position, relative to a specified group.
    This calculation is typically used in threat management systems to determine how
    much threat a tank is generating towards a target. The method takes into account
    positional data of both entities and returns an angle value that represents their
    directional alignment within the context of the group. This angle can be used
    for AI decision-making, threat distribution calculations, or positioning adjustments
    in group scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: tankPos
    description: The position identifier or index of the tank within the group. This
      typically represents a unique reference to the tank's location in the group
      structure.
  - name: targetPos
    description: The position identifier or index of the target within the group.
      This represents the target's location relative to the group structure.
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier that defines the context for positioning calculations.
      This parameter helps determine which group's spatial relationships are being
      evaluated.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat angle in radians. The
    result typically indicates the angular difference between the tank and target
    positions, useful for determining threat distribution or positioning strategies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float angle = tankPositioning.CalculateThreatAngle(0, 2, 1); // Tank at
      pos 0, target at pos 2, in group 1
    language: cpp
  - title: Threat Angle Calculation for AI Decision Making
    code: "int tankIndex = GetTankPosition();\nint targetIndex = GetTargetPosition();\n\
      int groupId = GetCurrentGroup();\nfloat threatAngle = tankPositioning.CalculateThreatAngle(tankIndex,\
      \ targetIndex, groupId);\nif (threatAngle > 1.57f) // 90 degrees\n{\n    //\
      \ Adjust positioning to reduce threat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that tankPos and targetPos are valid indices within the
    group's positional structure. The implementation likely uses trigonometric functions
    to compute angular relationships, so performance may be impacted by frequent calls
    in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that tankPos and targetPos refer to valid positions within the
    specified group to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. The method
    does not validate input parameters, so callers must ensure proper indexing.
