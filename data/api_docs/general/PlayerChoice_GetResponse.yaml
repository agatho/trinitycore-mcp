documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific player choice response by its unique identifier from
    the player choice instance.
  description: The GetResponse method retrieves a PlayerChoiceResponse object associated
    with a given response ID within the context of a player choice dialog. This method
    is typically used during interaction with quest givers or NPCs that present multiple
    options to the player. The returned pointer provides access to response data such
    as reward information, associated quest IDs, and text prompts. It's important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the provided responseId exists
    in the current choice; it simply returns a pointer to the response if found, or
    nullptr if not. This method is part of the PlayerChoice system which allows for
    dynamic dialogue trees and branching quest paths in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the PlayerChoiceResponse object matching the provided
    responseId. Returns nullptr if no matching response is found within the current
    player choice instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetResponse
    code: "PlayerChoice* choice = player->GetPlayerChoice();\nconst PlayerChoiceResponse*\
      \ response = choice->GetResponse(12345);\nif (response)\n{\n    // Process the\
      \ response data\n    sLog->outString(\"Found response with ID: %u\", response->GetResponseId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PlayerChoice instance has been properly initialized
    and contains valid responses. The returned pointer is only valid as long as the
    PlayerChoice object remains in scope and hasn't been modified. Performance-wise,
    this operation should be relatively fast as it's likely implemented using a lookup
    table or map structure.
  warnings: Always check if the returned pointer is not nullptr before dereferencing
    it to avoid segmentation faults. The method signature indicates it takes an int32
    parameter but doesn't validate its range or existence within valid response IDs,
    so calling with invalid IDs may return nullptr without error.
