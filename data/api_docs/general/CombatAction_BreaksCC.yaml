documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat action breaks crowd control effects.
  description: The BreaksCC method checks if the current combat action has the ability
    to break existing crowd control effects on the target. This is commonly used in
    AI behavior to determine when a spell or ability can interrupt enemy abilities
    that have applied crowd control, such as fear, charm, or stun effects. The method
    returns true if the action is capable of breaking crowd control, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for proper AI decision-making in combat scenarios
    where breaking CC can significantly alter the battle dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat action breaks crowd control effects; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a spell breaks crowd control
    code: "if (combatAction->BreaksCC()) {\n    // This action can break CC effects\n\
      \    // Proceed with CC-breaking logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BreaksCC in AI decision making
    code: "void AI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING) ||\
      \ !me->IsInCombat())\n        return;\n\n    if (combatAction->BreaksCC() &&\
      \ target->HasCrowdControl()) {\n        // Use this action to break CC on the\
      \ target\n        DoCast(target, BREAK_CC_SPELL_ID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with unit state checking and
    crowd control tracking systems. The implementation likely checks against a predefined
    list or bitmask of actions that are known to break crowd control effects. Performance-wise,
    this is a fast boolean check that should not impact combat performance significantly.
  warnings: Ensure that the combat action being checked actually has the intended
    CC-breaking behavior implemented in its spell or ability data. Some actions may
    claim to break CC but might not work against all types of crowd control effects
    in the game mechanics.
