  method: IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes AI decision-making patterns to identify potential performance optimizations
    and bottlenecks in NPC behavior.
  description: The IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities method examines the profiling
    data collected by the AIDecisionProfiler to detect inefficiencies or recurring
    patterns in AI decision-making processes. This method is typically invoked during
    runtime analysis or performance tuning phases to help developers identify areas
    where AI logic can be optimized for better resource utilization and responsiveness.
    It does not modify any game state directly but prepares reports or logs that can
    be used by developers for optimization purposes. The method relies on previously
    collected profiling data and may have no effect if profiling has not been enabled
    or sufficient data has not been gathered.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Analysis
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.EnableProfiling(true);

      // ... AI behavior execution ...

      profiler.IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after sufficient profiling data has been
    collected. It is recommended to enable profiling before executing AI behaviors
    and then call this method afterward to analyze the results.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior profiling data may result in no actionable
    insights. Additionally, performance overhead from profiling itself should be considered
    when running in production environments.
