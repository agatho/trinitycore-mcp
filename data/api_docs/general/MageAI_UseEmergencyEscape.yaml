documentation:
  brief: Initiates an emergency escape mechanism for a Mage AI character.
  description: The UseEmergencyEscape method is designed to trigger an immediate escape
    sequence for a Mage AI instance, typically used when the character is in imminent
    danger or needs to rapidly disengage from combat. This method likely employs the
    Mage's ability to teleport out of dangerous situations, such as Blink or similar
    emergency spells. It may also handle cleanup of ongoing spell casts or combat
    states before initiating the escape. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no direct return value operations, focusing purely on the escape behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler(MageAI* mage)\n{\n    if (mage->IsInDangerousSituation())\n\
      \    {\n        mage->UseEmergencyEscape();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI state machine and should be called
    only when the Mage AI is in a valid escape-ready state. It may internally check
    for spell cooldowns or mana availability before executing the escape.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat or danger contexts may
    result in unexpected behavior or invalid escape attempts. Ensure proper state
    checks are performed before invoking this method.
