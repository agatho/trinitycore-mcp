api:
  class: BotSpawner
  method: CreateCharacterForAccount
  signature: int BotSpawner::CreateCharacterForAccount(uint32 accountId, const int
    & request)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot character for the specified account ID using the provided
    request data.
  description: The CreateCharacterForAccount method is responsible for generating
    a new bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an account identifier
    and a request object that defines the parameters for character creation. This
    method integrates with the bot spawning system to ensure proper initialization
    of bot characters, including setting up their attributes, inventory, and behavior
    patterns. The method typically operates within the context of automated bot management
    systems used in World of Warcraft private servers or development environments
    where scripted characters are needed for testing, simulation, or gameplay enhancement
    purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account for which the bot character will
      be created. Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: request
    description: Reference to an integer value that contains configuration parameters
      or flags for the character creation process. The exact meaning and format of
      this parameter depends on the implementation details of the BotSpawner class.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the character
    creation operation. A positive value typically indicates successful creation,
    while negative values may represent errors such as invalid account ID, insufficient
    resources, or configuration issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot character creation
    code: "int result = botSpawner->CreateCharacterForAccount(12345, 0);\nif (result\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot character created successfully with GUID: \"\
      \ << result << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to create bot\
      \ character. Error code: \" << result << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database operations and may require proper
    initialization of the TrinityCore core systems before execution. It's designed
    for use in automated bot management scenarios and assumes that the account exists
    and is valid.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper account validation or with invalid
    parameters can lead to database inconsistencies or system errors. Ensure that
    the accountId corresponds to an existing account and that the request parameter
    is properly formatted according to the BotSpawner's expected schema.
