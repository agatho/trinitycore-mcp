  class: ConditionMgr

    playerChoiceId, int32 playerChoiceResponseId, const Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the conditions required to interact with a specific
    player choice response.
  description: The IsObjectMeetingPlayerChoiceResponseConditions method evaluates
    whether a given player satisfies all the conditional requirements associated with
    a specific player choice response in the World of Warcraft game system. This function
    is typically used during interaction with quest gossip options or NPC dialogue
    systems where certain choices are only available based on player state, quest
    progress, or other game conditions. The method leverages TrinityCore's condition
    management system to validate these prerequisites before allowing the player to
    select a particular response option.
  parameters:
  - name: playerChoiceId
    description: The unique identifier of the player choice (gossip menu option) that
      the player is interacting with. This ID corresponds to entries in the playerchoice
      table.
  - name: playerChoiceResponseId
    description: The specific response ID within the player choice that the player
      is attempting to select. This ID maps to a particular response option in the
      player choice entry.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player.
      This parameter is essential for evaluating player-specific conditions such as
      quest status, item ownership, or reputation levels.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions required for the specified player choice
    response are met by the player; otherwise returns false. A return value of false
    typically means that the player cannot select this option due to unmet prerequisites.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in NPC gossip handling
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetingPlayerChoiceResponseConditions(12345,\
      \ 67890, player))\n{\n    // Player can select this choice\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(98765,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot select this choice\n  \
      \  player->PlayerTalkClass->SendCloseGossip();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a custom quest system
    code: "void PlayerChoiceHandler::HandlePlayerChoiceSelect(Player* player, uint32\
      \ choiceId, int32 responseId)\n{\n    if (sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetingPlayerChoiceResponseConditions(choiceId,\
      \ responseId, player))\n    {\n        // Proceed with the selected choice logic\n\
      \        switch (responseId)\n        {\n            case 1:\n             \
      \   player->AddQuestReward(12345);\n                break;\n            case\
      \ 2:\n                player->TeleportTo(0, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\n     \
      \           break;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Notify player\
      \ that they cannot make this selection\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this choice.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on TrinityCore's condition system which supports various
    condition types including quest status, item ownership, player level, faction
    standing, and more. The conditions are typically defined in the database tables
    such as playerchoice_response_conditions or similar. Performance-wise, this function
    may involve database lookups or complex conditional evaluations depending on how
    many conditions are attached to a specific choice response.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that condition
    evaluation might involve expensive operations like database queries or complex
    logic checks, so use this function judiciously in performance-critical code paths.
