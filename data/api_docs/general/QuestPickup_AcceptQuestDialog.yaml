  class: QuestPickup
  method: AcceptQuestDialog
  signature: bool QuestPickup::AcceptQuestDialog(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the quest acceptance process for a player by sending an accept
    quest dialog to the client.
  description: The AcceptQuestDialog method is responsible for displaying the standard
    quest acceptance dialog to a player in the World of Warcraft client. It handles
    the visual and interactive elements required when a player chooses to accept a
    quest, including showing quest details, rewards, and prerequisites. This method
    typically gets called internally by the core quest system when a player interacts
    with a quest giver object and selects to accept a specific quest. The method ensures
    that all necessary UI components are properly updated and sent to the client for
    display.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is accepting
      the quest. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that the player wishes to accept.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the quest dialog was successfully sent to the client and
    the process initiated, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues
    such as invalid quest ID or client communication problems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      if (QuestPickup::AcceptQuestDialog(player, questId)) {\n    // Quest dialog\
      \ sent successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to send quest dialog\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Acceptance
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif (player->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_NONE &&\n    player->CanTakeQuest(questId, false)) {\n   \
      \ if (QuestPickup::AcceptQuestDialog(player, questId)) {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system and should not
    typically be called directly by external modules. It relies on proper quest data
    being present in the database and assumes that the player object is valid and
    connected. The actual quest acceptance logic (such as adding items or updating
    quest status) occurs separately after this dialog is displayed.
  warnings: Calling this method without validating that the quest exists and the player
    can accept it may result in client-side errors or unexpected behavior. Always
    ensure that quest prerequisites are checked before invoking this method.
