api:
  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetPlateauDuration
  signature: uint32_t LearningAnalytics::GetPlateauDuration(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration of a learning plateau for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetPlateauDuration method returns the time duration, in seconds,
    that a specific bot has been in a learning plateau state. A learning plateau occurs
    when a bot's learning progress stagnates or plateaus, indicating minimal gains
    from further training or experience within a given timeframe. This method is typically
    used for analytics and performance monitoring of AI-driven bots in the game environment.
    The method takes a single parameter representing the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the bot and returns the duration of its current plateau state.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve the
      plateau duration. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the system.
  returns: Returns a uint32_t value representing the duration, in seconds, that the
    specified bot has been in a learning plateau state. A return value of 0 indicates
    either no plateau is active or the bot GUID was invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t plateauDuration = learningAnalytics.GetPlateauDuration(12345);\n\
      if (plateauDuration > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot is in plateau for \" << plateauDuration\
      \ << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No active plateau\
      \ detected\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Learning Progress
    code: "void MonitorBotProgress(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    uint32_t duration = learningAnalytics.GetPlateauDuration(botGuid);\n\
      \    if (duration > 3600) { // More than 1 hour\n        LOG_WARN(\"Bot %u has\
      \ been plateauing for over an hour\", botGuid);\n    } else if (duration > 0)\
      \ {\n        LOG_INFO(\"Bot %u is in a learning plateau (%u seconds)\", botGuid,\
      \ duration);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LearningAnalytics system maintains internal
    state tracking for each bot's learning progress. The returned duration may be
    updated periodically or upon specific events such as training completion or experience
    gain. Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active and tracked bot
    entity.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may return
    0, which could be interpreted as no plateau or a system error. Always validate
    the GUID before calling this method if possible. This method might not be thread-safe
    if used concurrently with other methods modifying the learning state.
