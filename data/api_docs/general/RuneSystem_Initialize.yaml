  class: RuneSystem
  method: Initialize
  signature: void RuneSystem::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the rune system for a bot character with provided configuration.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and configuration
    of the RuneSystem for a bot character. It prepares the system to manage rune-related
    mechanics such as cooldowns, activation states, and resource consumption. This
    method is typically called during bot initialization or when transitioning between
    different combat states. The method expects a pointer to an integer array that
    contains configuration parameters for the bot's rune behavior, including rune
    types, cooldown durations, and activation thresholds. The initialization process
    ensures that all rune-related data structures are properly allocated and configured
    before the bot begins using runes in gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing configuration parameters for
      the bot's rune system. The array should contain values specifying rune types,
      cooldown durations, activation thresholds, and other relevant settings for the
      bot character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Rune System Initialization
    code: 'int botConfig[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

      RuneSystem runeSys;

      runeSys.Initialize(botConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's initialization phase.
    The integer array pointed to by 'bot' must contain at least the required number
    of elements for proper configuration. The method does not validate input parameters,
    so developers should ensure correct data is passed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot configuration array contains
    valid values before calling this method.
