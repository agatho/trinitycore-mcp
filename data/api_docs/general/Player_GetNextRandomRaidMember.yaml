  class: Player
  method: GetNextRandomRaidMember
  signature: Player * Player::GetNextRandomRaidMember(float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the next random raid member within the specified radius.
  description: This method retrieves the next random player member from a raid group
    within the given radius. It is commonly used in raid-based gameplay mechanics
    where players need to find random targets for various activities such as loot
    distribution, group assignments, or quest objectives. The method operates on the
    principle of random selection within a defined radius, ensuring that the returned
    player is within the specified distance from the calling player. This functionality
    is particularly useful when implementing randomization logic in raid environments.
  parameters:
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which to search for raid members.
      This parameter defines the scope of the random selection, determining how far
      away from the calling player the method will look for potential candidates.
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Player object representing the next random raid
    member found within the specified radius. If no suitable player is found within
    the radius, this method returns nullptr. The returned player may be either a valid
    player or null depending on whether any players are within the defined radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* target = player->GetNextRandomRaidMember(10.0f);\nif (target !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic\n    // Use target for further operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* target = player->GetNextRandomRaidMember(30.0f);\nif (target !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Perform actions on the found player\n    // For example,\
      \ initiate loot distribution or quest assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in threaded environments as it may involve
    random selection logic that could potentially lead to race conditions if not properly
    handled. Performance considerations include the radius parameter affecting search
    time and memory usage. The method is thread-safe when used correctly, but developers
    should be aware of potential issues with concurrent access during raid member
    selection.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if no players are within the specified
    radius, which could lead to null pointer dereference errors if not properly handled
    in code. Care should be taken when using this method in scenarios where player
    availability is critical, such as loot distribution or quest assignment. Common
    mistakes include not checking for null returns before using the returned player
    object.
