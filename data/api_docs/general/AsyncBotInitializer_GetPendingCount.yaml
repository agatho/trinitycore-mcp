  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: GetPendingCount
  signature: size_t AsyncBotInitializer::GetPendingCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending asynchronous bot initializations.
  description: The GetPendingCount method retrieves the current count of bot initialization
    tasks that are pending completion. This is typically used to monitor the progress
    or workload of asynchronous bot setup operations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned value represents how many bots are currently in the process of being
    initialized but have not yet completed their setup routine. This method is thread-safe
    and provides a snapshot of the current state at the time of invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of pending bot initialization tasks.
    Returns zero if no initializations are currently pending.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Pending Bot Initializations
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer initializer;\nsize_t pendingCount = initializer.GetPendingCount();\n\
      if (pendingCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Still waiting for \" << pendingCount\
      \ << \" bots to initialize.\\n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Initialization Progress
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer* botManager = GetAsyncBotManager();\nwhile (botManager->GetPendingCount()\
      \ > 0) {\n    size_t count = botManager->GetPendingCount();\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Remaining initializations: \" << count << \"\\n\";\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a non-blocking read of the current pending count. The
    value returned is a snapshot and may change immediately after the call. It's recommended
    to use this method in conjunction with other synchronization mechanisms when precise
    tracking of initialization progress is required.
  warnings: The return value should not be used as a definitive indicator of system
    state since it can change between the time of the call and when the result is
    processed. In high-concurrency scenarios, multiple calls may return different
    values even within a short timeframe.
