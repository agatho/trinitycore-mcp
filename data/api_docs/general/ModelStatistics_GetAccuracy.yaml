  method: GetAccuracy
  signature: float ModelStatistics::GetAccuracy() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the accuracy percentage of the model statistics.
  description: The GetAccuracy method computes the accuracy of a model's performance
    based on stored statistics. This value typically represents the ratio of correct
    predictions or matches relative to total evaluations, expressed as a floating-point
    number between 0.0 and 1.0. The method is commonly used in AI-driven systems within
    TrinityCore to evaluate how well a model performs in tasks such as spell prediction,
    NPC behavior simulation, or other machine learning-based game mechanics. It does
    not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the accuracy of the model statistics. This value
    typically ranges from 0.0 (no accuracy) to 1.0 (perfect accuracy). If no statistics
    are available, it may return 0.0 or a default value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ModelStatistics stats;

      float accuracy = stats.GetAccuracy();

      std::cout << "Model Accuracy: " << accuracy * 100 << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Accuracy in Performance Evaluation
    code: "void EvaluateModelPerformance(ModelStatistics& stats) {\n    float accuracy\
      \ = stats.GetAccuracy();\n    if (accuracy >= 0.95f) {\n        std::cout <<\
      \ \"High accuracy model detected.\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (accuracy >=\
      \ 0.80f) {\n        std::cout << \"Acceptable model accuracy.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Model requires retraining.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not alter the internal state of the ModelStatistics
    object. It assumes that relevant statistical data has been previously populated,
    otherwise it may return an inaccurate or default value.
