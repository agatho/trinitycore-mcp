  class: ConditionsReference
  method: Meets
  signature: bool ConditionsReference::Meets(ConditionSourceInfo & sourceInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether the conditions referenced by this object are met given
    the provided source information.
  description: The Meets method checks if all the conditions stored in this ConditionsReference
    object are satisfied based on the provided ConditionSourceInfo. It is used extensively
    within TrinityCore's conditional system to determine whether actions, quests,
    or other game elements should be triggered or displayed. The method evaluates
    the logical relationships between conditions and returns true only if all conditions
    are met. This function is typically called during event processing, quest handling,
    or UI element visibility checks where conditional logic is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all conditions referenced by this object are satisfied
    according to the source information; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Condition Check
    code: "ConditionsReference conditionRef;\nConditionSourceInfo sourceInfo;\n//\
      \ ... populate sourceInfo with relevant data ...\nbool result = conditionRef.Meets(sourceInfo);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Execute action when conditions are met\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest System
    code: "void OnPlayerQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if\
      \ (quest->GetQuestRequirements() && quest->GetQuestRequirements()->Meets(player->GetConditionInfo()))\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n        player->AddQuest(quest);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle condition not met case\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's core conditional system and should be
    used carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks. The ConditionSourceInfo parameter
    contains all necessary context for evaluating conditions, including player state,
    world state, and other relevant factors. This method may recursively evaluate
    nested conditions if the referenced conditions contain sub-conditions.
  warnings: Improperly constructed ConditionsReference objects may cause unexpected
    behavior or crashes when Meets is called. Ensure that ConditionSourceInfo contains
    valid data before calling this method. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical
    code paths without proper caching mechanisms.
