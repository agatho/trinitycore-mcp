documentation:
  brief: Adds item duration to player's inventory.
  description: This method adds an item's duration to the player's inventory, typically
    used for managing item cooldowns and duration tracking. It ensures that items
    with duration are properly handled in the game context, particularly when items
    are added to the player's inventory or when item cooldowns need to be tracked.
    The method is essential for maintaining proper item state management and preventing
    duplicate item durations from being applied.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->AddItemDurations(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and may involve
    checking if an item already has a duration or if it needs to be added to the player's
    cooldown tracking system. Implementation details may vary depending on how item
    durations are handled internally.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper item handling;
    improper usage could lead to incorrect item state management and potential game
    mechanics issues.
