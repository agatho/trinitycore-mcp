  signature: uint32 UpdateFieldHolder::GetChangedObjectTypeMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask indicating which object types have changed in the update
    field holder.
  description: The GetChangedObjectTypeMask method retrieves a 32-bit bitmask that
    represents the set of object types whose fields have been modified within the
    UpdateFieldHolder. This mask is used by the TrinityCore server to efficiently
    determine which types of game objects (such as players, creatures, game objects,
    etc.) require updates to be sent to clients. The bitmask allows for optimized
    network communication by only sending update data for object types that have actually
    changed since the last update cycle. This method is typically called during the
    update process when preparing packets for client synchronization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a specific
    object type. Bit 0 represents the first object type, bit 1 the second, and so
    on. If a bit is set (1), it indicates that at least one object of that type has
    changed fields since the last update.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 changedMask = updateFieldHolder.GetChangedObjectTypeMask();\nif\
      \ (changedMask & (1 << OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER)) {\n    // Handle player object changes\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Object Types
    code: "uint32 mask = updateFieldHolder.GetChangedObjectTypeMask();\nif (mask)\
      \ {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\n        if (mask & (1 << i)) {\n  \
      \          // Process changes for object type i\n            printf(\"Object\
      \ type %d has changed\\n\", i);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the update system in TrinityCore and is typically
    used internally by the server's packet handling and object synchronization logic.
    The bitmask values are defined by the game's internal object type enumeration,
    and developers should not assume specific bit positions without consulting the
    relevant definitions in the codebase.
  warnings: The returned mask may be zero if no object types have changed since the
    last update cycle. Developers should always check for this condition when using
    the result to avoid incorrect assumptions about object changes.
