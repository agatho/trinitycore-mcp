  signature: uint8 Player::GetNumRespecs() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of respecs available to the player.
  description: The GetNumRespecs method retrieves the current count of respecs that
    a player has available for use. Respecs are used to reset skill points or talent
    points in World of Warcraft, allowing players to redistribute their points after
    spending them on skills or talents. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other player-related functions to manage character progression and skill
    point allocation. The returned value represents the number of respecs that can
    be used for resetting points, which may vary based on player level, achievements,
    or game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of respecs available to the
    player. This value typically ranges from 0 to 255, with 0 indicating no respecs
    are available and higher values indicating more respecs can be used for point
    reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 respecCount = player->GetNumRespecs();\nif (respecCount > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player can reset points\n    // Do something with respecs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's internal state management and should
    be used carefully in conjunction with other point reset functions. The value returned
    may depend on game mechanics such as level requirements or achievement unlocks.
  warnings: This method does not directly modify the player's point allocation; it
    simply returns the current count of respecs available. Improper use of this method
    can lead to incorrect point reset behavior if not combined with proper checks
    for available points.
