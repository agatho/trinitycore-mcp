documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a guild object from the manager by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetGuildById method fetches a Guild object from the GuildMgr singleton
    using the specified guild identifier. This method is commonly used to access guild
    data for operations such as checking membership, managing guild permissions, or
    retrieving guild information like name and leader. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal container that maps guild IDs to Guild objects. If no guild exists
    with the given ID, the method returns a null pointer. This function is thread-safe
    and can be called from any context where the GuildMgr instance is accessible.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Guild object if found; otherwise, a null pointer is returned
    when no guild exists with the specified ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(12345);\nif (guild)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Guild name: \" << guild->GetName() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Guild Existence
    code: "uint32 guildId = player->GetGuildId();\nGuild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\n\
      if (!guild)\n{\n    // Handle case where player is not in a guild\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with guild operations\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal lookup table that is populated during server
    startup and updated as guilds are created or destroyed. The returned Guild pointer
    remains valid only as long as the guild exists in the manager, so care must be
    taken not to use it after the guild has been deleted.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned Guild pointer is always valid; always check
    for null before using the result. Also, be cautious when calling this method from
    different threads, even though it's marked as const, as concurrent modifications
    to the guild list may occur.
