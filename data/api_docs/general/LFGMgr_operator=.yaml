documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LFGMgr instance to this instance, leaving the
    source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for LFGMgr transfers all managed resources
    and state from the right-hand side LFGMgr object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of internal data structures
    without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a valid state, but
    its contents are unspecified after the move. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG
    (Looking for Group) system, this operator allows efficient management of LFG data
    structures when reassigning or swapping LFG managers during gameplay operations
    such as player group creation, queue management, or system cleanup. This is a
    standard C++ move semantics implementation that avoids unnecessary copying of
    potentially large internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LFGMgr object after the move assignment has
    been completed, enabling chained assignments if needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LFGMgr manager1;

      LFGMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in LFG System Context
    code: "void UpdateLFGManager(LFGMgr& oldManager, LFGMgr& newManager) {\n    //\
      \ Transfer LFG data from old manager to new manager\n    oldManager = std::move(newManager);\n\
      \    // newManager is now in a valid but unspecified state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which is crucial for performance
    optimization in systems managing large data structures like LFG queues. The moved-from
    object remains in a valid state but its contents are undefined. This is particularly
    important for LFGMgr as it likely manages complex internal state including player
    queues, group information, and matchmaking data that should be efficiently transferred
    rather than copied.
  warnings: Never use the moved-from object after a move assignment unless explicitly
    documented otherwise. The source object's state becomes unspecified but remains
    valid, so accessing its members without proper initialization can lead to undefined
    behavior. In LFG context, ensure that no active player queues or group operations
    are disrupted by this operation.
