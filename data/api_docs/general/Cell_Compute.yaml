documentation:
  brief: Computes and returns the X and Y coordinates of the cell within the world
    grid.
  description: The Compute method calculates the absolute world coordinates (X and
    Y) that correspond to the cell's position in the game world grid. This method
    is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine the physical
    location of a cell for various operations such as object placement, visibility
    calculations, and zone management. The computed coordinates are returned through
    reference parameters, allowing the caller to obtain both the X and Y values directly.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters since it operates
    on the cell's internal state.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Cell cell(5, 10);

      int x, y;

      cell.Compute(x, y);

      // x and y now contain the computed world coordinates for the cell at grid position
      (5, 10)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core grid management system in TrinityCore. It
    assumes that the cell object has valid internal coordinates and does not perform
    bounds checking or validation. The computed coordinates are typically used for
    spatial queries and rendering purposes within the game world.
