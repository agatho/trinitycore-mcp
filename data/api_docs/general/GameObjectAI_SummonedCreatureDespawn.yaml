  class: GameObjectAI
  method: SummonedCreatureDespawn
  signature: void GameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDespawn(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the cleanup and removal of summoned creatures when they despawn.
  description: The SummonedCreatureDespawn method is invoked by the GameObjectAI framework
    when a creature that was summoned by this game object is removed from the world.
    This typically occurs when the summoned creature dies, is dismissed, or otherwise
    becomes invalid. The method ensures proper cleanup of any references or state
    associated with the summoned creature within the AI system. It allows the GameObjectAI
    to maintain accurate tracking of summoned units and perform necessary housekeeping
    operations such as decrementing summon counts or triggering related events.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has despawned. This parameter
      represents the specific summoned creature instance that is being removed from
      the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom GameObjectAI
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void SummonedCreatureDespawn(Creature*\
      \ creature) override {\n        // Perform cleanup when summoned creature despawns\n\
      \        if (creature && creature->IsSummon()) {\n            // Reset summon\
      \ counter or trigger event\n            --m_summonCount;\n        }\n      \
      \  GameObjectAI::SummonedCreatureDespawn(creature);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectAI callback system and is automatically
    invoked by the TrinityCore framework when a summoned creature despawns. Developers
    should ensure that any custom logic in this method does not cause performance
    bottlenecks or infinite recursion. The method may be called multiple times if
    several creatures are summoned and despawned.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from user code unless you understand
    the internal mechanics of GameObjectAI. Improper handling can lead to dangling
    pointers or incorrect state tracking. Avoid performing heavy operations in this
    method as it's invoked frequently during gameplay.
