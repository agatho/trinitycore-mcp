  class: AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator
  method: Finalize
  signature: void AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator::Finalize(int * param0, bool
    param1, bool param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the distraction movement behavior for an assisted creature, cleaning
    up resources and resetting movement state.
  description: The Finalize method is responsible for completing the distraction movement
    behavior of a creature that was previously engaged in an assistance-based distraction
    movement. This method typically handles cleanup operations such as releasing any
    held references, resetting internal movement flags, and ensuring the creature's
    AI state is properly transitioned after the distraction sequence has concluded.
    It ensures that the creature returns to its normal behavior or transitions to
    another appropriate AI state. The method may also handle any necessary resource
    deallocation or state reset required for the movement generator to be safely reused
    or destroyed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a movement
      identifier or state flag used during distraction behavior.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the distraction movement was successful
      and should be finalized with normal completion procedures.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag that may control whether additional cleanup or state
      reset operations should be performed during finalization.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalize Call
    code: 'AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator generator;

      int movementId = 12345;

      bool success = true;

      bool cleanup = true;

      generator.Finalize(&movementId, success, cleanup);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when a distraction
    movement sequence ends. Developers should not directly call this method unless
    implementing custom AI behavior or debugging movement generators.
  warnings: Direct invocation of Finalize without proper context may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that all parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method.
