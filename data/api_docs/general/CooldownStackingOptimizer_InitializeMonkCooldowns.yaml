  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializeMonkCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for Monk class abilities within the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    system.
  description: The InitializeMonkCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and configurations required for managing cooldowns specific to Monk class abilities
    in TrinityCore's cooldown stacking optimization framework. This method is typically
    called during player initialization or when switching to the Monk specialization,
    ensuring that all relevant Monk cooldowns are properly registered and tracked
    for optimal stacking behavior. It prepares the system to handle unique Monk mechanics
    such as Chi-based abilities, Brewmaster's protective cooldowns, and Mistweaver's
    healing cooldowns.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeMonkCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session or when the Monk
    specialization is first selected. The initialization process may involve loading
    ability data from the game database and setting up internal cooldown timers. It's
    recommended to call this method before any cooldown-related operations are performed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate cooldown entries or inconsistent behavior. Ensure that player specialization
    state is correctly set before invoking this method.
