  class: Map
  method: AddPlayerToMap
  signature: bool Map::AddPlayerToMap(Player * player, bool initPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the map, initializing their presence in the world.
  description: The AddPlayerToMap method integrates a Player object into the current
    Map instance, making the player visible and active within that specific game world.
    This method is typically invoked when a player enters a new zone or when a player's
    session is initialized. It handles the necessary internal bookkeeping to track
    the player's position, update relevant subsystems like visibility detection, and
    prepare the player for gameplay interactions. The method may perform initialization
    tasks if initPlayer is set to true, such as sending initial packets, setting up
    player state, or triggering related events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object to be added to the map. Must not be
      null.
  - name: initPlayer
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to perform player initialization
      tasks. If true, additional setup like sending initial packets or triggering
      events is performed.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the map; false otherwise.
    Failure may occur due to invalid input, map state issues, or internal errors during
    the addition process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Map* map = ...;\nPlayer* player = ...;\nbool success = map->AddPlayerToMap(player,\
      \ true);\nif (success) {\n    // Player successfully added to the map\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Initialization
    code: "Map* map = ...;\nPlayer* player = ...;\n// Add player without initialization\
      \ (e.g., during server load)\nbool success = map->AddPlayerToMap(player, false);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core game world management system and should only
    be called from appropriate contexts such as player login or zone transitions.
    It's important to ensure that the player object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method. The method may internally trigger various subsystem
    updates including visibility calculations, event notifications, and packet sending.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of player objects before
    invoking this method. Also, be cautious about calling this during critical sections
    of the game loop to avoid race conditions or inconsistent state.
