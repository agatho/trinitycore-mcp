    gy) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific child terrain grid file exists for the given map and
    grid coordinates.
  description: The HasChildTerrainGridFile method determines whether a particular
    child terrain grid file is available for a specified map ID and grid coordinates.
    This functionality is essential for managing terrain data in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment, where large maps are divided into smaller grid sections
    for efficient loading and memory usage. The method evaluates the existence of
    terrain data files that correspond to specific grid positions within a given map,
    enabling the game engine to load only necessary terrain components. It supports
    the dynamic loading of terrain assets based on player position and map requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which to check terrain grid
      file existence
  - name: gx
    description: The X coordinate of the grid cell to check (typically ranges from
      0 to 63 for standard maps)
  - name: gy
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid cell to check (typically ranges from
      0 to 63 for standard maps)
  returns: Returns true if a child terrain grid file exists for the specified map
    and grid coordinates, false otherwise. This indicates whether the terrain data
    for that specific grid section is available for loading.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check grid file existence
    code: "if (terrainInfo->HasChildTerrainGridFile(0, 10, 15)) {\n    // Terrain\
      \ grid file exists for map 0 at grid coordinates (10, 15)\n    // Proceed with\
      \ terrain loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple grid positions for terrain data
    code: "uint32 mapId = 1;\nfor (int32 x = 0; x < 64; ++x) {\n    for (int32 y =\
      \ 0; y < 64; ++y) {\n        if (terrainInfo->HasChildTerrainGridFile(mapId,\
      \ x, y)) {\n            // Process terrain data for this grid cell\n       \
      \     // This could involve loading heightmaps or other terrain properties\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the terrain management system to determine
    which grid files need to be loaded. The grid coordinates are typically in the
    range of 0-63 for standard World of Warcraft maps, though this may vary depending
    on map size and implementation details. The method likely performs file system
    checks or uses internal caching mechanisms to quickly determine grid file existence
    without full data loading.
  warnings: Ensure that the mapId parameter corresponds to a valid map in the game
    world, as invalid map IDs may cause unexpected behavior. Be aware that this method
    might not account for dynamically generated terrain or temporary grid files that
    are created during runtime but not persisted to disk.
