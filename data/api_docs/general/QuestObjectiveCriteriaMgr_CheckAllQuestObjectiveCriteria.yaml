  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: CheckAllQuestObjectiveCriteria
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::CheckAllQuestObjectiveCriteria(int *
    referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates all quest objective criteria for a given player and updates their
    progress accordingly.
  description: The CheckAllQuestObjectiveCriteria method iterates through all active
    quest objectives for the specified player and checks whether the criteria associated
    with each objective have been met. This method is typically invoked during gameplay
    events such as item collection, mob kills, or other actions that contribute to
    quest completion. It ensures that quest progress is accurately tracked and updated
    in real-time. The method operates on a provided player reference, which is expected
    to be a valid pointer to a player object within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of quest systems by
    ensuring timely updates to player progress.
  parameters:
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). The method uses this reference to locate and evaluate the player's active
      quests and their associated criteria.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CheckAllQuestObjectiveCriteria
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::CheckAllQuestObjectiveCriteria(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core game loop or triggered
    by specific player actions. It does not directly modify the database but updates
    in-memory quest data structures. Performance may be impacted if a large number
    of active quests exist for a single player.
  warnings: Ensure that the referencePlayer parameter points to a valid player object;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Avoid calling this method from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization.
