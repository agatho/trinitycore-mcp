  class: Spell
  method: UpdateDelayMomentForUnitTarget
  signature: void Spell::UpdateDelayMomentForUnitTarget(Unit * unit, uint64 hitDelay)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the delay moment for a unit target in the spell's execution timeline.
  description: The UpdateDelayMomentForUnitTarget method adjusts the timing of when
    a spell's effects are applied to a specific unit target. This is typically used
    during spell casting to synchronize delayed actions or effects with the target's
    current state. The method modifies internal spell data related to target timing
    and delay mechanics, ensuring that delayed spell effects occur at the correct
    moment in the game's execution flow. It is commonly invoked when processing spell
    impacts or handling delayed damage/healing effects.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target for which the
      delay moment should be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: hitDelay
    description: The delay duration (in milliseconds) that should be applied to this
      unit's spell impact timing. Used to synchronize delayed effects with the target's
      state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update delay for a target unit
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    uint64 delay\
      \ = 1000; // 1 second delay\n    spell->UpdateDelayMomentForUnitTarget(target,\
      \ delay);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell execution pipeline and should only be called
    during active spell processing. It modifies internal spell timing data which affects
    how delayed effects are scheduled and executed.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer can cause undefined behavior or crashes. This method does not
    validate input parameters beyond basic null checks.
