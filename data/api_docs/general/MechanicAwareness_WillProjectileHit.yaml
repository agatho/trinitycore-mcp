  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: WillProjectileHit
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::WillProjectileHit(const ProjectileInfo & projectile,
    Player * target, float tolerance)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a projectile will hit a target based on mechanic awareness
    and tolerance.
  description: The WillProjectileHit method evaluates if a given projectile, defined
    by its properties, will successfully strike a specified target player. It takes
    into account various game mechanics such as target positioning, movement, and
    environmental factors that influence projectile trajectory. The method uses a
    tolerance parameter to allow for minor deviations in hit detection, which is particularly
    useful for handling network latency or slight discrepancies in client-server synchronization.
    This function is typically used in combat systems to determine successful hits
    during spell or ability casting.
  parameters:
  - name: projectile
    description: Reference to the ProjectileInfo structure containing details about
      the projectile being evaluated, including origin, direction, speed, and other
      relevant properties.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the intended target of
      the projectile. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in
      undefined behavior.
  - name: tolerance
    description: Floating-point value defining acceptable deviation from perfect hit
      accuracy. Higher values allow for more lenient hit detection, useful for compensating
      for network lag or minor positioning errors.
  returns: Returns true if the projectile is expected to hit the target within the
    specified tolerance; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Projectile Hit Check
    code: "ProjectileInfo proj;\nproj.origin = player->GetPosition();\nproj.direction\
      \ = player->GetOrientation();\nproj.speed = 10.0f;\n\nbool hit = mechanicAwareness->WillProjectileHit(proj,\
      \ targetPlayer, 0.5f);\nif (hit) {\n    // Process successful hit logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Projectile Hit with Dynamic Tolerance
    code: "float dynamicTolerance = CalculateNetworkLatencyCompensation(player);\n\
      ProjectileInfo proj;\nproj.origin = player->GetPosition();\nproj.direction =\
      \ player->GetOrientation();\nproj.speed = 15.0f;\n\nbool hit = mechanicAwareness->WillProjectileHit(proj,\
      \ targetPlayer, dynamicTolerance);\nif (hit) {\n    // Apply damage and effects\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle miss or evaded attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on current player positions and orientations.
    For best results, ensure that both the projectile and target are in valid states
    before calling this function. The tolerance parameter should be tuned according
    to game balance requirements and network conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null target pointer may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate input parameters before use. Be cautious when using
    very high tolerance values as they might lead to unintended hit accuracy.
