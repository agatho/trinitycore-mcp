documentation:
  brief: Checks if the buyer functionality is enabled for the specified auction house
    type.
  description: This method determines whether the Auction Bot's buyer component is
    enabled for a given auction house type. It is used to control the bot's ability
    to purchase items on behalf of players or the server. The method takes an AuctionHouseType
    parameter which specifies the type of auction house (e.g., AH_NORMAL, AH_GUILD_BANK)
    and returns a boolean indicating if buyer operations are allowed for that specific
    auction house. This functionality is crucial for server administrators who want
    to selectively enable or disable automated purchasing features based on auction
    house type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the buyer functionality is enabled for the specified auction
    house type, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the Auction
    Bot can perform buying operations for items in the given auction house type, while
    false means such operations are disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Check if buyer is enabled for normal auction house
    code: "if (auctionBotConfig->GetConfigBuyerEnabled(AuctionHouseType::AH_NORMAL))\
      \ {\n    // Buyer functionality is enabled\n    // Proceed with buyer-related\
      \ operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional buyer operation based on configuration
    code: "AuctionHouseType houseType = AuctionHouseType::AH_GUILD_BANK;\nif (auctionBotConfig->GetConfigBuyerEnabled(houseType))\
      \ {\n    // Perform guild bank auction buying\n    bot->BuyItemsFromAuction(houseType);\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip buyer operations for this auction house type\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      auctionbot\", \"Buyer disabled for {}\", static_cast<int>(houseType));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AuctionBotConfig
    methods to fully configure the bot's behavior. The configuration values are usually
    loaded from the TrinityCore configuration files or database at server startup.
    This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context.
  warnings: Ensure that the AuctionHouseType parameter passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior or undefined results. When disabling
    buyer functionality for certain auction house types, make sure to also consider
    related seller configurations to maintain consistent bot behavior.
