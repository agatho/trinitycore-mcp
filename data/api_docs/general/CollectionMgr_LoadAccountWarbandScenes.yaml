  method: LoadAccountWarbandScenes
  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadAccountWarbandScenes(int knownWarbandScenes)
documentation:
  brief: Loads account warband scenes for the player's collection.
  description: The LoadAccountWarbandScenes method initializes and retrieves warband
    scene data associated with the player's account. This method is typically invoked
    during the player's login process or when accessing account-specific content related
    to warbands. It ensures that all known warband scenes are properly loaded into
    the CollectionMgr for use in the game interface, such as displaying available
    warband achievements or unlockable content. The method operates on the account
    level rather than character-specific data, meaning it affects all characters under
    the same account.
  parameters:
  - name: knownWarbandScenes
    description: An integer value representing the bitmask or identifier of known
      warband scenes for the account. This parameter determines which warband scenes
      should be loaded and made available in the player's collection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during login
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = sCollectionMgr;

      mgr->LoadAccountWarbandScenes(0x1F); // Load first 5 warband scenes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    account initialization. It may involve database queries to fetch account-specific
    warband scene data and cache it for efficient access throughout the session.
  warnings: Ensure that the knownWarbandScenes parameter accurately reflects the current
    state of available scenes to prevent loading invalid or outdated data. Improper
    use could lead to missing content or incorrect UI display.
