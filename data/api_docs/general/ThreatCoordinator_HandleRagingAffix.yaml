  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::HandleRagingAffix()
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Raging affix effect to the current threat coordinator's target.
  description: The HandleRagingAffix method implements the mechanics of the Raging
    affix, which typically increases damage dealt by a creature or player while also
    potentially altering their threat generation behavior. This method is part of
    the ThreatCoordinator class and is invoked when the Raging affix is active on
    a unit. It modifies the target's threat table and may influence how the unit interacts
    with aggro mechanics during combat. The effect usually enhances the unit's offensive
    capabilities while maintaining or increasing its threat level to ensure it remains
    a primary target for enemies.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyCreature::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_ragingAffixActive)\n\
      \        m_threatCoordinator->HandleRagingAffix();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Raging affix state is already active and managed
    elsewhere in the codebase. It should not be called directly without verifying
    the affix status to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking for active affix states may
    lead to inconsistent threat calculations or unexpected combat behavior. Ensure
    that all related affix flags are properly synchronized before calling this function.
