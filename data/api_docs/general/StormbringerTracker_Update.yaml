  class: StormbringerTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void StormbringerTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the StormbringerTracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the StormbringerTracker for a given player bot. This method likely handles
    tracking various aspects related to the Stormbringer ability or item, such as
    cooldowns, usage statistics, or status effects. It may also update internal counters,
    check conditions, or synchronize data with the game world state. The method is
    typically called during game loop iterations or in response to specific events
    that affect the player's Stormbringer-related capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose StormbringerTracker
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot

      StormbringerTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Game Loop Context
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_bot)\n        m_stormbringerTracker.Update(m_bot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the bot's AI update cycle to
    ensure accurate tracking of Stormbringer-related states. It may perform operations
    that affect performance if called too frequently without proper throttling.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method
    assumes the player object remains valid throughout its execution.
