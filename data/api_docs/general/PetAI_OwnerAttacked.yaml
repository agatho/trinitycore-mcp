  class: PetAI
  method: OwnerAttacked
  signature: void PetAI::OwnerAttacked(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the pet's response when its owner is attacked by an enemy target.
  description: The OwnerAttacked method is invoked by the PetAI class to manage the
    behavior of a pet when its owner receives an attack. This method typically triggers
    the pet to either assist the owner in combat or react accordingly based on the
    pet's AI settings and current state. It serves as a core component for pet combat
    response logic within the TrinityCore framework, ensuring pets dynamically react
    to threats targeting their owners.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the entity
      that attacked the pet's owner. This value is typically a GUID or similar unique
      identifier used internally by the game engine to distinguish between different
      creatures, players, or objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pet AI logic
    code: "void MyPetAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (owner && owner->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Simulate a call to OwnerAttacked when owner is attacked\n\
      \        OwnerAttacked(&attackerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI system for summoned pets and should be
    called only when the pet's owner is actually under attack. The target parameter
    must point to a valid identifier that can be used by the game engine to resolve
    the attacking entity.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing an invalid or null pointer for the target parameter
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes within the AI system. Ensure that the
    target value corresponds to a real, existing entity in the game world before invoking
    this method.
