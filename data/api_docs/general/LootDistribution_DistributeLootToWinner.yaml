  class: LootDistribution
  method: DistributeLootToWinner
  signature: void LootDistribution::DistributeLootToWinner(uint32 rollId, uint32 winnerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Distributes loot to the player who won the specified roll.
  description: The DistributeLootToWinner method handles the distribution of loot
    items to the player who has won a specific loot roll. This method is typically
    invoked after a loot roll has been completed and determines which player receives
    the item based on the roll results. It ensures that the winning player's inventory
    is updated with the awarded loot, and any associated loot history or tracking
    mechanisms are properly maintained. The method requires valid roll and winner
    identifiers to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier of the loot roll that was completed. This ID corresponds
      to a specific roll in the game's loot system.
  - name: winnerGuid
    description: Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of the player who won the loot roll.
      This identifies the recipient of the distributed loot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Distributing Loot to Winner
    code: 'LootDistribution lootDist;

      uint32 rollId = 12345;

      uint32 winnerGuid = 67890;

      lootDist.DistributeLootToWinner(rollId, winnerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the roll has already been processed and validated.
    It does not perform any validation on the rollId or winnerGuid parameters, so
    incorrect values may lead to undefined behavior or failed loot distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the rollId corresponds to a valid completed roll before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid winnerGuid may result in items not being properly
    awarded to any player.
