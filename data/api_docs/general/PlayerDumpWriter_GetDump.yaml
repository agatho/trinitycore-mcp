  class: PlayerDumpWriter
  method: GetDump
  signature: bool PlayerDumpWriter::GetDump(int guid, std::string & dump)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the player dump data for a specified GUID and stores it in the
    provided string reference.
  description: The GetDump method is responsible for retrieving the complete player
    dump data associated with a given global unique identifier (GUID). This functionality
    is typically used for exporting or archiving player character data, including
    their inventory, stats, quests, and other relevant game state information. The
    method populates the provided string reference with the serialized dump data if
    successful, returning true. If no player exists with the specified GUID or an
    error occurs during retrieval, it returns false. This method is commonly used
    in administrative tools or database synchronization processes within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player whose dump data is to
      be retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID greater than zero.
  - name: dump
    description: Reference to a string where the player dump data will be stored upon
      successful retrieval. The string will be overwritten with the serialized player
      data.
  returns: True if the player dump was successfully retrieved and stored in the dump
    parameter; false if no player exists with the specified GUID or an error occurred
    during the retrieval process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerDumpWriter dumpWriter;\nint playerId = 12345;\nstd::string playerDump;\n\
      if (dumpWriter.GetDump(playerId, playerDump)) {\n    std::cout << \"Player dump\
      \ retrieved successfully. Size: \" << playerDump.length() << \" bytes\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to retrieve player dump for GUID: \" <<\
      \ playerId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Administrative Tool
    code: "void ExportPlayerData(int guid) {\n    PlayerDumpWriter writer;\n    std::string\
      \ dumpData;\n    if (writer.GetDump(guid, dumpData)) {\n        // Save to file\
      \ or database\n        std::ofstream outFile(\"player_\" + std::to_string(guid)\
      \ + \".dump\");\n        outFile << dumpData;\n        outFile.close();\n  \
      \      std::cout << \"Exported player data for GUID: \" << guid << std::endl;\n\
      \    } else {\n        std::cerr << \"Could not export data for player GUID:\
      \ \" << guid << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant I/O operations and database queries,
    especially for players with large inventories or extensive quest data. It should
    be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths. The returned dump string
    contains serialized binary or text-based player state information that is specific
    to the TrinityCore implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent GUIDs as it may result
    in undefined behavior or database errors. Ensure proper error handling and validation
    before calling this method in production code.
