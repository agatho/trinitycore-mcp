api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: HandleCrowdControlPriority
  signature: bool PriestAI::HandleCrowdControlPriority(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and prioritizes target selection for crowd control abilities.
  description: The HandleCrowdControlPriority method evaluates potential targets within
    the AI's range to identify the most suitable candidate for applying crowd control
    effects. It considers factors such as threat level, target proximity, and current
    combat state to prioritize targets that maximize the effectiveness of crowd control
    abilities. This method is typically invoked during the AI's decision-making process
    when crowd control spells are available and ready for use. The method modifies
    the target pointer to reference the selected priority target, returning true if
    a valid target was identified and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated with the index or identifier
      of the prioritized target. If no suitable target is found, this value may remain
      unchanged or be set to -1.
  returns: Returns true if a valid target was identified and assigned to the target
    parameter; otherwise returns false when no appropriate target exists for crowd
    control application.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (priestAI->HandleCrowdControlPriority(&targetIndex)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ crowd control spell on the prioritized target\n    CastSpellOnTarget(CROWD_CONTROL_SPELL,\
      \ targetIndex);\n} else {\n    // No valid target found, continue with other\
      \ AI logic\n    ExecuteDefaultBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat management system
    code: "int priorityTarget = -1;\nif (priestAI->HandleCrowdControlPriority(&priorityTarget))\
      \ {\n    if (IsTargetInRange(priorityTarget) && IsTargetThreatening()) {\n \
      \       // Execute crowd control on high-priority target\n        UseCrowdControlAbility(priorityTarget);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already established a list of valid targets
    within its detection range. The priority logic may vary based on the specific
    priest class specialization and current spell rotation strategy. Performance is
    optimized by caching target evaluation results when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method should not be called during
    combat states where targets are rapidly changing, as it may return outdated target
    information.
