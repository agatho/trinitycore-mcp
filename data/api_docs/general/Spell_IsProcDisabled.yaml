  method: IsProcDisabled
  signature: bool Spell::IsProcDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell's proc mechanism is disabled, preventing it from
    triggering effects.
  description: The IsProcDisabled method checks if a spell has been marked as disabled
    for proc-based effects. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft to prevent
    certain spells from triggering their associated procs, such as those from enchantments,
    talents effects, or other special abilities. The method returns true when the
    spell's proc is disabled and false when it is enabled. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining game balance and preventing unintended behavior during spell processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell's proc is disabled, otherwise false. A return
    value of true indicates that the spell will not trigger its associated proc effects,
    while false means the proc is enabled and can potentially be triggered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsProcDisabled()) {\n    // Do something when proc is disabled\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Handle normal proc behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell processing logic
    to ensure proper handling of proc-based effects. It may be called during spell
    initialization or when checking if a spell should trigger its proc mechanism.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as disabling procs can affect
    gameplay balance and potentially cause unintended consequences if not handled
    properly. The method should only be used in contexts where the proc behavior needs
    to be explicitly disabled.
