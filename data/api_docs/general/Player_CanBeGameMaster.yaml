  brief: Determines whether the player can be assigned as a Game Master
  description: This method checks if the player is eligible to be promoted to a Game
    Master role within the game. It evaluates various conditions including account
    permissions, character level requirements, and administrative status. The method
    typically returns true when the player meets all criteria for Game Master access,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game security
    and ensuring only authorized personnel can assume administrative roles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can be assigned as a Game Master, false otherwise.
    The method may return false due to insufficient account permissions, character
    level restrictions, or other administrative constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->CanBeGameMaster()) {\n    // Player can be promoted to Game\
      \ Master\n}\nelse {\n    // Player cannot be promoted\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking account permissions, character level
    requirements, and administrative status. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this is a simple boolean check. Thread safety is ensured since the method is
    const and does not modify any state.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly grant Game Master privileges;
    it only indicates eligibility. The actual promotion process requires additional
    checks and procedures.
