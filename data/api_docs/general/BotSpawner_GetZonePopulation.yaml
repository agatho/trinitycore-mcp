  signature: int BotSpawner::GetZonePopulation(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current population count of bots in a specified zone
  description: The GetZonePopulation method returns the number of active bot characters
    within a given zone. This method is used by the BotSpawner class to monitor and
    manage bot distribution across different zones in the game world. The returned
    value represents the total count of bots currently spawned and active in the specified
    zone, which can be used for various spawning logic decisions such as load balancing
    or population control. The method takes a zone identifier as input and performs
    a lookup to determine how many bots are present in that particular zone at the
    time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of active bot characters currently
    present in the specified zone. Returns 0 if no bots are found in the zone or if
    the zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int population = botSpawner->GetZonePopulation(1234);\nif (population <\
      \ 10) {\n    // Spawn more bots in this zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Population Monitoring
    code: "uint32 zoneId = 5678;\nint currentPop = botSpawner->GetZonePopulation(zoneId);\n\
      if (currentPop > 50) {\n    // Reduce bot population in this zone\n} else if\
      \ (currentPop < 20) {\n    // Increase bot population in this zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation on the internal bot tracking system.
    The returned value is only as accurate as the last update of the bot spawn manager.
    For high-frequency checks, consider caching results to avoid performance degradation.
    The method assumes valid zone IDs and will return 0 for invalid or non-existent
    zones.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in tight loops may impact performance due
    to internal lookup operations. Ensure that zone IDs passed to this method are
    validated before use to prevent unexpected behavior. This method does not account
    for bots that are in the process of spawning or despawning.
