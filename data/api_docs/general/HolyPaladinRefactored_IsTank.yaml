  signature: bool HolyPaladinRefactored::IsTank(Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified player is assigned as a tank role within
    the Holy Paladin class.
  description: The IsTank method evaluates if a given Player object is currently fulfilling
    the tanking role for a Holy Paladin. This typically involves checking the player's
    current specialization, gear setup, and any active abilities or buffs that designate
    them as the primary threat absorber in a group or raid environment. The method
    may also consider the player's current stance or form to ensure they are properly
    equipped for tanking duties. It is commonly used in AI decision-making logic,
    role assignment systems, or combat strategy calculations where knowing the player's
    designated role is crucial for optimal performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is actively fulfilling a tanking role; otherwise
    returns false. The determination may be based on specialization, equipped items,
    active abilities, or other gameplay mechanics relevant to the Holy Paladin class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (paladin->IsTank(player)) {\n    // Execute tank-specific actions\n\
      \    paladin->UseShieldBlock();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment Check
    code: "bool isTank = holyPaladin.IsTank(targetPlayer);\nif (isTank) {\n    //\
      \ Assign target to tanking priority\n    group->SetTank(targetPlayer);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Assign target to DPS or healing priority\n    group->SetDps(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the player's role
    assignment rather than direct inspection of their current equipment or abilities.
    It may cache results for performance reasons and should be called only when necessary
    to avoid unnecessary overhead in high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not used in contexts where the player's role
    might change dynamically during combat, as cached values could lead to incorrect
    behavior. Also, be aware that the method may return false if the player is not
    in a valid state for tanking (e.g., not in a group or raid context).
