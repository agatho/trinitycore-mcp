documentation:
  brief: Loads quest request items data for a given quest.
  description: This method initializes and loads the request items data associated
    with a specific quest, including item requirements and quantities needed for quest
    completion. It processes the quest's request item fields to determine what items
    are required from players and their respective counts. The method is typically
    called during quest initialization or when loading quest data from database, ensuring
    that quest request items are properly configured before player interaction. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining proper quest mechanics and item tracking
    in World of Warcraft.

  notes: This method is part of the internal quest loading mechanism and should not
    be called directly by external code. It typically operates on internal fields
    that represent quest request item data from database tables.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of internal quest loading routines,
    as it may cause undefined behavior or data corruption if used improperly. The
    fields parameter is expected to be properly initialized and validated before calling
    this method.
