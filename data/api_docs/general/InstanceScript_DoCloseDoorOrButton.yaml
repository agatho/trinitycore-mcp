documentation:
  brief: Closes a door or button object identified by its GUID in the instance.
  description: The DoCloseDoorOrButton method is used to close doors or buttons within
    a World of Warcraft instance script. It takes a GUID parameter that identifies
    the specific game object to be closed. This method is typically invoked during
    instance events, such as boss encounters or quest progression, where certain doors
    or buttons need to be closed programmatically. The method operates on the GameObject
    associated with the provided GUID and sets its state to closed, which may trigger
    related events or mechanics depending on how the object was defined in the database.
    This functionality is essential for managing dynamic instance environments and
    ensuring proper object states during scripted sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the door or button GameObject to
      be closed. This value corresponds to the low GUID of the game object in the
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Closing a Door After Boss Kill
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnBossKill(uint32 bossId) override\n    {\n        if (bossId == BOSS_MARWYN)\n\
      \        {\n            DoCloseDoorOrButton(12345);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Closing Multiple Doors in Sequence
    code: "void BossInstanceScript::CloseAllDoors()\n{\n    DoCloseDoorOrButton(54321);\n\
      \    DoCloseDoorOrButton(54322);\n    DoCloseDoorOrButton(54323);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the GameObject being properly registered in the instance's
    object management system. The GUID must correspond to an actual door or button
    that has been loaded into the instance. It is recommended to verify that the object
    exists before calling this method to prevent potential errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or runtime errors. Always ensure that the GUID refers to a
    valid GameObject before invoking this function.
