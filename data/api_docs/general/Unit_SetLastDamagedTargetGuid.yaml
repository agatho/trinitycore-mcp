  class: Unit
  method: SetLastDamagedTargetGuid
  signature: void Unit::SetLastDamagedTargetGuid(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the last damaged target for the unit.
  description: This method assigns the unique identifier (GUID) of the most recently
    damaged target to the unit's internal tracking mechanism. It is commonly used
    in game mechanics to maintain awareness of which entity was last targeted or damaged
    by this unit, particularly in combat situations. The method does not directly
    affect the target's state but rather updates the unit's internal reference for
    tracking purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity that was last damaged.
      This value represents a valid object GUID in the TrinityCore system, typically
      used to identify players, creatures, or GameObjects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetLastDamagedTargetGuid(12345);

      // This sets the last damaged target GUID to 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with combat-related operations
    and may be part of a larger system for tracking combat state. It should be called
    when a unit successfully damages another entity, ensuring that the last damaged
    target GUID is properly updated.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in multi-threaded environments
    as it may not be thread-safe. Ensure proper synchronization if used in concurrent
    scenarios.
