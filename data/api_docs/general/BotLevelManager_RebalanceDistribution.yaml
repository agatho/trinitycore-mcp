  signature: void BotLevelManager::RebalanceDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Rebalances the distribution of bot levels within the managed player group.
  description: The RebalanceDistribution method adjusts the level distribution among
    bots in a player group to maintain optimal gameplay balance. This function ensures
    that bots are distributed across different levels to provide appropriate challenge
    and experience scaling for the group. It typically recalculates and redistributes
    bot levels based on current group composition, player levels, and predefined balancing
    rules. The method is commonly invoked when new players join or existing players
    leave a group, or during periodic rebalancing cycles.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLevelManager* levelManager = sBotLevelManager;

      levelManager->RebalanceDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or when significant changes occur
    in the group composition to maintain balanced gameplay. The rebalancing algorithm
    considers factors such as player level ranges, bot availability, and group objectives.
