documentation:
  brief: Handles the player logout process by cleaning up social connections and updating
    player state.
  description: The HandlePlayerLogout method is responsible for managing the cleanup
    operations that occur when a player logs out of the game. This includes removing
    the player from various social systems such as friend lists, ignore lists, and
    guild member lists. It ensures that all social data is properly synchronized and
    persisted before the player's session ends. The method also handles any necessary
    notifications to other players or systems about the logout event. This function
    is typically called internally by the core game loop when a player initiates or
    completes the logout sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Logout Handler
    code: "void Player::HandleLogout()\n{\n    // Perform logout cleanup\n    sSocialMgr->HandlePlayerLogout(this);\n\
      \    // Continue with other logout procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked during the player logout sequence and
    should not be called directly from external code unless specifically required
    for custom logout logic. The implementation may involve database operations to
    persist social state changes, so performance considerations apply during high-concurrency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand the complete logout
    flow. Improper usage can lead to inconsistent social data states and potential
    memory leaks in social system components.
