  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: ExecuteAsyncNoResult
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::ExecuteAsyncNoResult(int * stmt, uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a database statement asynchronously without returning results.
  description: The ExecuteAsyncNoResult method submits a database statement for asynchronous
    execution within the BotDatabasePool. This method is designed to perform write
    operations or queries that do not require result set retrieval, such as INSERT,
    UPDATE, DELETE, or other DDL statements. The operation runs in the background
    using the pool's thread pool, preventing blocking of the calling thread. The timeoutMs
    parameter specifies how long to wait for the statement to complete before timing
    out. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments
    where database interactions must be handled efficiently to maintain server performance
    and responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the prepared database statement
      identifier. This should reference a valid prepared statement created through
      the database pool's preparation mechanism.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Timeout value in milliseconds for the asynchronous execution. If
      the operation does not complete within this time, it will be cancelled or marked
      as failed depending on implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int statementId = botDatabasePool.PrepareStatement("INSERT INTO bot_data
      (bot_id, data) VALUES (?, ?)");

      botDatabasePool.ExecuteAsyncNoResult(&statementId, 5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int statementId = botDatabasePool.PrepareStatement(\"UPDATE bot_config\
      \ SET last_seen = NOW() WHERE bot_id = ?\");\nif (statementId != -1)\n{\n  \
      \  botDatabasePool.ExecuteAsyncNoResult(&statementId, 3000);\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Handle prepare statement error\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is non-blocking and uses a thread pool for execution. It's important
    to ensure that the statement identifier passed is valid and prepared before calling
    this method. The timeout value should be chosen carefully to balance responsiveness
    with resource usage.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for the stmt parameter; this will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all database statements are properly
    prepared before attempting asynchronous execution.
