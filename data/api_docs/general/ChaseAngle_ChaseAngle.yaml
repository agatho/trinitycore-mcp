  class: ChaseAngle
  method: ChaseAngle
  signature: void ChaseAngle::ChaseAngle(float angle, float _tolerance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target angle for an object to chase, with optional tolerance.
  description: The ChaseAngle method configures an object's movement behavior to face
    and move toward a specified angular direction. This is commonly used in AI systems
    to control how creatures or NPCs orient themselves when pursuing targets. The
    method accepts a target angle in radians and a tolerance value that defines how
    closely the object must align with the target angle before considering the orientation
    complete. This functionality is essential for realistic movement patterns in game
    entities, particularly during combat or pursuit scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: angle
    description: Target angle in radians that the object should face. This represents
      the direction the object will attempt to align with during movement.
  - name: _tolerance
    description: Angular tolerance in radians that determines when the object is considered
      to have reached the target angle. A smaller value means stricter alignment requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Angle Usage
    code: ChaseAngle(1.57f, 0.1f); // Set object to chase 90-degree angle with 5.73-degree
      tolerance
    language: cpp
  - title: Precise Chase Angle for Combat AI
    code: ChaseAngle(target->GetOrientation(), 0.01f); // Align closely with target's
      orientation for accurate combat movement
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically integrates with movement controllers and AI state machines
    to provide smooth directional transitions. It may internally use rotation interpolation
    or angular velocity calculations to achieve the desired orientation.
  warnings: "Ensure that the angle parameter is within valid range (typically -\u03C0\
    \ to \u03C0 radians) to avoid unexpected behavior. Setting tolerance too low may\
    \ cause the object to never fully align due to floating-point precision issues."
