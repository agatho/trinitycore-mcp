  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CalculateItemValue
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateItemValue(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the value of a loot item for a given player based on item properties
    and player context.
  description: The CalculateItemValue method determines the relative worth of a loot
    item for a specific player. It evaluates various factors such as item quality,
    level, stats, and the player's current needs to compute a float-based value score.
    This value is used internally by the LootAnalysis system to rank items during
    loot distribution decisions, particularly in scenarios like group loot or when
    determining optimal item allocation. The method considers the player's class,
    specialization, gear level, and other relevant attributes to provide an accurate
    assessment of item desirability.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the item value is being calculated.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being evaluated. The item must have valid data for its properties to
      be properly assessed.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated worth of the loot item for the
    specified player. Higher values indicate more desirable items based on the player's
    context and needs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      LootItem item = ...;

      float value = LootAnalysis::CalculateItemValue(player, item);

      // Use ''value'' to determine item desirability'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Loot Distribution Logic
    code: "Player* player1 = ...;\nPlayer* player2 = ...;\nLootItem item = ...;\n\
      float value1 = LootAnalysis::CalculateItemValue(player1, item);\nfloat value2\
      \ = LootAnalysis::CalculateItemValue(player2, item);\nif (value1 > value2) {\n\
      \    // Assign item to player1\n} else {\n    // Assign item to player2\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot analysis system and may be called frequently
    during group loot scenarios. Performance considerations should be taken into account
    when using this method in high-frequency loops or real-time systems. The calculation
    includes multiple factors that can vary based on game updates and expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as passing null pointers will result in undefined behavior. The returned
    value is context-sensitive and may not represent absolute item worth but rather
    relative desirability for the specific player.
