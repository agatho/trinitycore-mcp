  class: FarthestTargetSelector
  method: FarthestTargetSelector
  signature: void FarthestTargetSelector::FarthestTargetSelector(const Unit * unit,
    float dist, bool playerOnly, bool inLos)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FarthestTargetSelector with specified unit, distance, and filtering
    criteria.
  description: The FarthestTargetSelector constructor initializes a target selection
    mechanism that identifies the farthest valid target within a given distance. This
    selector can be configured to filter targets based on whether they are players
    only and whether they are in line of sight. It is typically used in AI behavior
    trees or combat logic where selecting the furthest eligible enemy is required
    for specific spell or ability usage. The method sets up internal state for target
    selection but does not perform the actual selection; that is usually done through
    a separate invocation of the selector's evaluation function.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: The unit (creature or player) that owns or is using this target selector.
      Must be a valid pointer to a Unit object.
  - name: dist
    description: Maximum distance within which targets will be considered. Targets
      beyond this range are ignored.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: If true, only player-controlled units will be considered as valid
      targets. If false, all eligible units (including creatures) may be selected.
  - name: inLos
    description: If true, targets must be within line of sight of the unit. If false,
      targets may be selected even if obstructed by terrain or objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: 'FarthestTargetSelector selector(unit, 30.0f, true, true);

      // This creates a selector that finds the farthest player within 30 yards with
      line of sight.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using for Non-Player Target Selection
    code: 'FarthestTargetSelector selector(unit, 50.0f, false, false);

      // This creates a selector that finds the farthest unit (player or creature)
      within 50 yards without requiring line of sight.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an AI targeting system and should be used in conjunction
    with other methods like Evaluate() or GetTarget() to actually retrieve the selected
    target. The selector does not perform real-time updates; it stores configuration
    parameters for later use.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'unit' parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this constructor, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that using large distances with 'inLos' set to true can impact
    performance due to line-of-sight calculations.
