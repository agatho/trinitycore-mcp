  method: DoEventIfAny
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoEventIfAny(Player * owner, const
    TaxiPathNodeEntry * node, bool departure)
documentation:
  brief: Processes taxi path events for a player during flight movement.
  description: The DoEventIfAny method handles the execution of events associated
    with a taxi path node when a player is in flight. It determines whether to process
    departure or arrival events based on the node type and updates the player's state
    accordingly. This method is typically invoked during the flight path movement
    update cycle to manage in-flight interactions such as quest objectives, NPC encounters,
    or other scripted events tied to specific waypoints along the taxi route.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is currently following the flight
      path. This represents the entity whose movement state and events are being processed.
  - name: node
    description: Pointer to the TaxiPathNodeEntry structure representing the current
      node in the taxi path. Contains information about the waypoint, including event
      triggers and location data.
  - name: departure
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the event is for departure (true) or arrival
      (false). Controls which type of event processing occurs at the node.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in flight path update
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) override {\n    if (!owner || !node)\n       \
      \ return;\n    DoEventIfAny(owner, node, isDeparture);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing arrival event at taxi node
    code: "void ProcessArrival(Player* player, const TaxiPathNodeEntry* arrivalNode)\
      \ {\n    if (player && arrivalNode)\n        DoEventIfAny(player, arrivalNode,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal flight path movement system and should
    not be called directly by external code. The method relies on the player's current
    taxi path state and node data to determine appropriate event handling. It may
    modify the player's quest progress or trigger in-game events depending on the
    node configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (null pointers) can lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure that both owner and node are valid before invoking
    this method. The departure flag must accurately reflect whether the player is
    departing from or arriving at a node.
