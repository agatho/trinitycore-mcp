  method: ShouldFeignDeath
  signature: bool HunterAI::ShouldFeignDeath() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should feign death based on current combat
    conditions and threat level.
  description: The ShouldFeignDeath method evaluates the hunter's current state in
    combat to decide if feign death should be triggered. This AI decision is based
    on factors such as the hunter's health percentage, the threat level from nearby
    enemies, and whether the hunter is currently engaged in combat. The method returns
    true when the hunter's survival strategy dictates that feigning death would be
    beneficial, typically when health drops below a certain threshold or when threat
    levels are high enough to warrant temporary escape from combat. This behavior
    helps optimize the hunter's survivability during intense encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should feign death based on current combat conditions;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (hunterAI->ShouldFeignDeath()) {\n    hunter->CastSpell(hunter, 5384,\
      \ true); // Feign Death\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the HunterAI class's core decision-making logic and
    integrates with the overall combat behavior system. It may be called frequently
    during combat updates, so performance should be considered when implementing custom
    logic.
