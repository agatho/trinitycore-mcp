  class: Channel
  method: SetOwner
  signature: void Channel::SetOwner(const Player * player, const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the owner of a channel to the specified player.
  description: The SetOwner method assigns ownership of a channel to a given player.
    This operation typically occurs when a player creates a channel or transfers channel
    ownership to another player. The method updates internal channel data structures
    to reflect the new owner, ensuring that only the designated player can perform
    administrative actions such as kicking members or changing channel settings. Channel
    ownership is crucial for maintaining proper channel management and preventing
    unauthorized modifications to channel properties.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will become the new owner of the
      channel. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers are not allowed.
  - name: name
    description: String representing the name of the channel for which ownership is
      being set. This should match an existing channel name in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Channel Owner
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->SetOwner(player, \"General\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the channel's permission
    system and may broadcast ownership change notifications to channel members. It
    should only be called when proper validation of player and channel existence has
    been performed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or non-existent channel
    name can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that both parameters
    are valid before invoking SetOwner.
