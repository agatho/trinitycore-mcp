  signature: bool GameObjectModel::IsMapObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is a map object.
  description: The IsMapObject method checks if the GameObjectModel instance represents
    a map object within the World of Warcraft environment. This typically indicates
    whether the object is part of the static world geometry, such as terrain features,
    buildings, or other environmental elements that are not dynamic game entities.
    The method returns true if the object is classified as a map object, and false
    otherwise. This check is commonly used during collision detection and spatial
    queries to distinguish between interactive game objects and static environment
    components.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the GameObjectModel represents a map
    object. Returns true if the object is part of the map geometry; returns false
    if it's a dynamic game object or otherwise not classified as a map object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if object is map object
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = ...;\nif (model->IsMapObject()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ map object logic\n    printf(\"This is a map object\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle non-map object logic\n    printf(\"This is not a map object\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal flags or classifications set during
    the GameObjectModel's initialization or loading process. It may be used in conjunction
    with other spatial queries to optimize collision detection and rendering performance
    by separating static map geometry from dynamic game entities.
