  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: RemoveBotSession
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::RemoveBotSession(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot session associated with the specified player GUID from the
    optimized world session manager.
  description: The RemoveBotSession method is responsible for removing a specific
    bot session identified by its player GUID from the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    collection. This method ensures that the bot session is properly cleaned up and
    removed from internal tracking structures, freeing associated resources. It typically
    operates within the context of a World of Warcraft TrinityCore server environment
    where bots are managed through specialized session management systems. The method
    performs validation to ensure the GUID corresponds to an existing bot session
    before attempting removal.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose bot session needs
      to be removed. This should be a valid 32-bit integer representing the player's
      unique ID in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the bot session was successfully found and removed; returns
    false if no session exists for the provided player GUID or if the removal operation
    failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized sessionManager;\nuint32 botPlayerGuid = 123456;\n\
      bool success = sessionManager.RemoveBotSession(botPlayerGuid);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Bot session removed successfully\n    printf(\"Bot session removed\
      \ for player %u\\n\", botPlayerGuid);\n} else {\n    // No session found or\
      \ removal failed\n    printf(\"Failed to remove bot session for player %u\\\
      n\", botPlayerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class maintains
    an internal data structure (such as a map or hash table) mapping player GUIDs
    to bot sessions. The implementation should be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded
    environment, though this is not explicitly stated. It's recommended to check for
    session existence before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations.
  warnings: Calling RemoveBotSession with an invalid or non-existent playerGuid may
    result in a false return value without any error messages. Ensure proper validation
    of the GUID before invoking this method to prevent unexpected behavior.
