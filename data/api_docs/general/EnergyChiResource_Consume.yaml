  class: EnergyChiResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool EnergyChiResource::Consume(uint32 energyCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of energy or chi resource from the player's current
    resource pool.
  description: The Consume method reduces the current energy or chi resource value
    by the specified cost amount. It is typically used during ability usage to deduct
    the required resource cost from the player's available resources. The method returns
    true if the resource consumption was successful (i.e., sufficient resources were
    available), and false if there were insufficient resources to complete the operation.
    This method is commonly used in conjunction with spell or ability execution logic
    within the TrinityCore framework to enforce resource costs for various game actions
    such as abilities, spells, or special moves.
  parameters:
  - name: energyCost
    description: The amount of energy or chi resource to be consumed from the current
      resource pool. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the cost of
      the action being performed.
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of energy/chi was successfully deducted
    from the resource pool, indicating sufficient resources were available. Returns
    false if there were insufficient resources to complete the consumption, leaving
    the resource pool unchanged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY) >= 10)\n{\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_ENERGY,\
      \ -10);\n    // Perform ability execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using EnergyChiResource::Consume
    code: "EnergyChiResource* resource = player->GetEnergyChiResource();\nif (resource\
      \ && resource->Consume(25))\n{\n    // Successfully consumed 25 energy/chi,\
      \ proceed with ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ID, true);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Not enough resources, send error message\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough energy!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the resource pool has sufficient capacity to handle
    the requested consumption. It is recommended to check available resource levels
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The method does not directly
    interact with the player's UI or send notifications about insufficient resources;
    it only performs the mathematical deduction.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player has sufficient resources
    may lead to negative resource values, which can cause undefined behavior in gameplay
    mechanics. Always validate resource availability before consumption.
