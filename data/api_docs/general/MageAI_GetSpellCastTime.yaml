  class: MageAI
  method: GetSpellCastTime
  signature: uint32 MageAI::GetSpellCastTime(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cast time of a specified spell for the Mage AI.
  description: The GetSpellCastTime method returns the cast duration in milliseconds
    for a given spell ID within the Mage AI context. This method is essential for
    managing spell casting behavior, ensuring proper timing and cooldowns during combat.
    The returned value represents the base cast time without considering any modifiers
    such as haste or spell-specific adjustments. It serves as a foundational component
    for spell execution logic and helps maintain synchronization between the AI's
    actions and game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the cast time of the specified spell
    in milliseconds. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the spell ID is
    invalid or not recognized by the Mage AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Cast Time for Fireball
    code: "uint32 castTime = mageAI->GetSpellCastTime(133); // Fireball spell ID\n\
      if (castTime > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic using the retrieved\
      \ cast time\n    // For example, schedule the spell to be cast after this duration\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal spell data structures or lookup tables.
    It may not account for dynamic modifiers like haste effects that could alter actual
    cast times during runtime. The implementation might cache spell information for
    performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure the spell ID passed to this method is valid and supported by the
    Mage AI; invalid IDs may return 0, which could lead to incorrect behavior if not
    handled properly. This method should only be called when the AI has a valid target
    and context for casting.
