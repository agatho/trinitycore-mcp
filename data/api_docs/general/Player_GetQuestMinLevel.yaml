  method: GetQuestMinLevel
  signature: int32 Player::GetQuestMinLevel(uint32 contentTuningId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum level required for a quest based on content tuning
    ID.
  description: This method returns the minimum level that players must reach in order
    to be able to accept and complete quests associated with a specific content tuning
    ID. It is used primarily for determining quest eligibility within the game's progression
    system, particularly when dealing with dynamic content such as dungeons, raids,
    or other content that has varying difficulty levels based on player level. The
    method ensures proper quest progression by checking against the minimum required
    level for each content tuning ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the minimum level required for a quest
    associated with the specified content tuning ID. If no valid minimum level is
    found, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 minLevel = player->GetQuestMinLevel(12345);\nif (minLevel > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Quest can be accepted\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest cannot be accepted\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine whether a player meets the necessary requirements for a quest. It
    may return 0 if no valid minimum level exists for the content tuning ID, indicating
    that the quest might not be available or accessible.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if no valid minimum
    level is found, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about quest availability.
    Also, ensure that content tuning IDs are correctly identified before calling this
    method.
