  class: LFGGroupScript
  method: OnDisband
  signature: void LFGGroupScript::OnDisband(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a LFG group is disbanded, allowing scripts to perform cleanup
    or notify players.
  description: The OnDisband method is invoked when a Looking For Group (LFG) group
    is disbanded, typically triggered by the group leader leaving the group or explicitly
    disbanding it. This method provides a hook for custom scripts to execute logic
    such as cleaning up player data, sending notifications, or resetting LFG status.
    It ensures that any necessary cleanup or state changes occur when the group ceases
    to exist. The method is part of the LFGGroupScript class and is called automatically
    by the TrinityCore framework during group disbanding events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that is being disbanded. This represents
      the LFG group instance which is no longer active.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyLFGScript : public LFGGroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnDisband(Group*\
      \ group) override\n    {\n        // Log that the group was disbanded\n    \
      \    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"LFG Group disbanded with %u members.\"\
      , group->GetMembersCount());\n        \n        // Perform any custom cleanup\
      \ here\n        for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n\
      \             itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end(); ++itr)\n        {\n    \
      \        Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n         \
      \   if (player)\n            {\n                // Reset LFG status for each\
      \ player\n                player->SetLfgDungeon(0);\n            }\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the group disbanding process, so any modifications
    to the group object itself should be handled carefully. The group pointer passed
    in may become invalid after this function returns if the group is fully destroyed.
  warnings: Do not attempt to access or modify the group object after performing operations
    that might lead to its destruction. Be cautious with asynchronous operations that
    could cause race conditions.
