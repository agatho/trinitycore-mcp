  class: MomentumTracker
  method: UpdateMomentum
  signature: void MomentumTracker::UpdateMomentum()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the momentum state of the tracker based on current game conditions
    and player actions.
  description: The UpdateMomentum method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    any changes to the momentum state within the MomentumTracker class. This typically
    involves evaluating the current movement, speed, direction, or other dynamic factors
    that influence momentum in the game world. The method may be called during frame
    updates or in response to specific events such as player input or environmental
    changes. It ensures that the momentum tracker accurately reflects the current
    state of the tracked object or entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all momentum trackers\n    for\
      \ (auto& tracker : momentumTrackers)\n    {\n        tracker->UpdateMomentum();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked frequently during the game loop and should
    be optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks. It may interact with physics calculations
    or movement systems, so care must be taken when modifying its behavior in custom
    modules.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the intended update cycle may lead to inconsistent
    momentum states. Ensure that all related systems (e.g., movement, physics) are
    properly synchronized before invoking this function.
