documentation:
  brief: Initializes the absorb aura order predicate for handling aura absorption
    mechanics in World of Warcraft combat system.
  description: The AbsorbAuraOrderPred class serves as a predicate functor used within
    TrinityCore's aura system to determine the correct ordering of absorb effects
    when multiple auras are active on a target. This is crucial for proper damage
    absorption calculations, ensuring that higher-priority absorb effects are applied
    before lower-priority ones. The constructor initializes internal state required
    for comparing aura absorb priorities, which directly impacts how damage is distributed
    across multiple protective auras during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating and Using AbsorbAuraOrderPred
    code: 'AbsorbAuraOrderPred pred;

      // Used internally by aura management system

      typedef std::function<bool(Aura const*, Aura const*)> AuraOrderPred;

      AuraOrderPred orderPred = std::bind(&AbsorbAuraOrderPred::operator(), &pred,
      std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This predicate is typically used internally by TrinityCore's aura application
    system and should not be instantiated directly by external code. The ordering
    logic considers factors such as aura duration, priority levels, and absorb amount
    thresholds to ensure correct absorption behavior during combat.
