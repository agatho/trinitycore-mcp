    numAttacks)
documentation:
  brief: Logs extra attacks triggered by spell effects for a target unit
  description: This method handles the execution of logging extra attacks that occur
    as a result of spell effects, particularly those involving additional attack mechanics.
    It processes the effect index and logs the number of attacks associated with a
    victim unit, typically used in scenarios where spells trigger additional attacks
    beyond normal melee attacks. The method is part of the spell's execution flow
    and ensures proper logging of extra attack events during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The effect index that triggered the extra attacks, representing which
      spell effect caused the additional attacks to occur.
  - name: victim
    description: The target unit that received the extra attacks, typically a player
      or creature that was attacked by the spell.
  - name: numAttacks
    description: The number of extra attacks to log for the victim, indicating how
      many additional attacks were triggered by this effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      Unit* target = new Unit();

      spell->ExecuteLogEffectExtraAttacks(0, target, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      Unit* target = new Unit();

      spell->ExecuteLogEffectExtraAttacks(3, target, 2);

      // This logs 2 extra attacks from effect index 3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell effects that generate
    additional attacks. It should be called during the execution phase of a spell
    when extra attacks are triggered by effects, and it ensures proper logging of
    these events for combat tracking purposes.
  warnings: The method assumes that the victim parameter is valid and not null; calling
    this method with a null victim may cause crashes or undefined behavior. Also,
    care must be taken to ensure that the effect index corresponds to valid spell
    effects that actually generate extra attacks.
