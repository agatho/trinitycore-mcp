  class: BotScheduler
  method: IsBotScheduled
  signature: bool BotScheduler::IsBotScheduled(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot with the specified GUID is scheduled for execution.
  description: The IsBotScheduled method determines if a bot identified by its unique
    global identifier (GUID) is currently scheduled to be executed or processed by
    the bot scheduler system. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to manage and track active bot operations, ensuring that only scheduled
    bots are processed during specific time intervals or events. The method performs
    a lookup in an internal data structure that maintains the state of all scheduled
    bots. It returns true if the bot is found in the scheduled list, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining efficient resource usage and preventing
    duplicate processing of the same bot instance.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for scheduling
      status. This value should be a positive integer representing the bot's identifier
      within the TrinityCore database system.
  returns: Returns true if a bot with the specified GUID is currently scheduled for
    execution, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the bot has
    been added to the scheduler's active queue and will be processed according to
    the scheduling rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botScheduler.IsBotScheduled(12345)) {\n    // Bot with GUID 12345 is\
      \ scheduled\n    std::cout << \"Bot is scheduled for execution\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Bot with GUID 12345 is not scheduled\n    std::cout << \"Bot\
      \ is not scheduled\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management
    code: "void ProcessScheduledBots() {\n    for (auto& bot : GetAllBots()) {\n \
      \       if (botScheduler.IsBotScheduled(bot.GetGUID())) {\n            // Execute\
      \ the scheduled bot\n            bot.Execute();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may involve iterating through
    an internal data structure. For optimal performance, it's recommended to cache
    the result of this check if it's called multiple times in quick succession. The
    method assumes that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot within the system.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and represents an
    actual bot entity, as passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to unexpected
    behavior or undefined results. This method should not be used to validate bot
    existence, only to check scheduling status.
