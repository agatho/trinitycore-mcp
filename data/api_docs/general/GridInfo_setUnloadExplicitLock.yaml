  signature: void GridInfo::setUnloadExplicitLock(bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the explicit unload lock state for the grid.
  description: The setUnloadExplicitLock method controls whether the grid is locked
    from being unloaded. When enabled, it prevents the grid from being removed from
    memory even if no players or creatures are present. This is typically used during
    critical operations such as loading or saving data, or when certain objects need
    to remain in memory for game logic purposes. The lock is not automatically released
    and must be manually cleared by calling the method with 'false'.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Locking a Grid During Data Load
    code: 'GridInfo* gridInfo = ...;

      guard->setUnloadExplicitLock(true); // Prevent grid from unloading during load
      operation

      // Perform data loading here

      gridInfo->setUnloadExplicitLock(false); // Release the lock after loading'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in TrinityCore's grid management system to
    ensure that grids containing important objects or undergoing critical operations
    are not prematurely unloaded. It's essential for maintaining game state integrity
    during asynchronous operations.
  warnings: Improper use of this lock can lead to memory leaks or stale data if the
    lock is never released. Always ensure that every call to setUnloadExplicitLock(true)
    has a corresponding setUnloadExplicitLock(false).
