documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type mask associated with the proc event information.
  description: The GetTypeMask method returns an integer value representing the type
    mask of the proc event. This mask is used internally by TrinityCore to categorize
    and filter different types of events that can trigger procs. The returned value
    typically corresponds to specific event types such as damage, healing, spell cast,
    or periodic effects. Understanding this mask helps in determining how a proc should
    be handled based on the triggering event's nature. This method is commonly used
    within spell and aura systems where proc conditions need to be evaluated against
    the type of event that occurred.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the type mask of the proc event. The specific bits
    in this mask correspond to different event types, such as damage events, healing
    events, or spell casts. The exact meaning of each bit is defined by the core's
    event type constants and is used for filtering and matching proc conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Proc Condition Check
    code: "void MySpell::HandleProc(Unit* target, DamageInfo& damageInfo)\n{\n   \
      \ ProcEventInfo eventInfo(target, damageInfo);\n    int typeMask = eventInfo.GetTypeMask();\n\
      \    if (typeMask & PROC_FLAG_DAMAGE)\n    {\n        // Handle damage-based\
      \ proc\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Type Mask for Event Filtering
    code: "bool MyAura::CheckProc(ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n    int mask = eventInfo.GetTypeMask();\n\
      \    // Only proc on periodic damage\n    if ((mask & PROC_FLAG_PERIODIC) &&\
      \ (mask & PROC_FLAG_DAMAGE))\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return\
      \ false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The type mask returned by this method is a bitwise combination of predefined
    event types defined in the TrinityCore codebase. Developers should be familiar
    with these constants to properly interpret the returned value. The mask may include
    multiple flags set simultaneously, indicating that the event triggered multiple
    event types.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting the returned integer value as it represents
    a bitmask. Direct comparison against specific values without proper bit manipulation
    may lead to incorrect behavior. Always use bitwise operations (e.g., & operator)
    when checking for specific event types.
