documentation:
  brief: Returns the reputation rank for a specified faction.
  description: The GetReputationRank method retrieves the current reputation rank
    of the player for a given faction ID. This method is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft development to determine how much influence a player has with specific
    factions, such as NPCs or quest rewards. The returned value represents one of
    the five standard reputation ranks (Hated, Hostile, Neutral, Friendly, Exalted)
    and is typically used in conjunction with other reputation-related methods to
    manage player progression. This method does not modify any state; it simply returns
    the current rank without changing anything.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the reputation rank of the player for
    the specified faction. The value corresponds to one of the following ranks: 0
    (Hated), 1 (Hostile), 2 (Neutral), 3 (Friendly), or 4 (Exalted). If the faction
    ID is invalid or not found, the method returns 0.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int rank = player->GetReputationRank(112); // Returns rank for faction ID
      112 (e.g., Argent Dawn)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and is typically used in conjunction
    with GetReputationValue() to determine the full reputation status. The method
    is thread-safe as it does not modify any internal state, but may return different
    values depending on the player's current faction status.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid faction IDs; it will return
    0 instead of throwing an error, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about
    reputation status if not handled properly.
