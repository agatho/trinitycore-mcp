  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::ResetMetrics(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the behavioral metrics for a specified bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears or reinitializes the adaptive behavior
    tracking data associated with a specific bot in the TrinityCore AI system. This
    function is typically invoked when a bot's behavior needs to be reset to its initial
    state, often during bot creation, reconfiguration, or after significant changes
    in gameplay conditions. The method operates on the internal metrics that the BehaviorAdaptation
    class uses to adjust and optimize bot decision-making processes based on past
    performance and environmental factors.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose behavioral metrics
      are to be reset. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      behaviorAdaptation->ResetMetrics(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect the bot's current
    decision-making behavior. It is recommended to ensure that no active AI processing
    is occurring for the specified bot before invoking this function.
