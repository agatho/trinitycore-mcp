  signature: ::Unit * MageAI::GetBestPolymorphTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable target unit for applying a polymorph
    spell.
  description: The GetBestPolymorphTarget method evaluates available targets within
    the MageAI's current context to identify the optimal unit for casting a polymorph
    spell. This method considers factors such as target threat level, distance, and
    whether the target is already affected by polymorph effects. It ensures that the
    AI selects a target that maximizes the effectiveness of the polymorph ability
    while adhering to game mechanics and combat strategies. The returned Unit pointer
    represents the chosen target or NULL if no suitable target exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ::Unit object that is determined to be the best target
    for polymorphing, or NULL if no valid target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in MageAI logic
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetBestPolymorphTarget();\nif (target && !target->HasAura(SPELL_POLYMORPH))\
      \ {\n    // Cast polymorph on the selected target\n    ai->DoCast(target, SPELL_POLYMORPH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the MageAI's decision-making loop to
    select targets for crowd control abilities. It may consider various factors like
    threat level, distance, and existing debuffs on potential targets.
