documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the pet level-up spell mapping data from the database.
  description: The LoadPetLevelupSpellMap method is responsible for loading pet level-up
    spell data from the database into memory. This data determines which spells a
    pet learns at specific levels, enabling proper pet behavior in World of Warcraft.
    The method typically executes during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all pet spell learning information is available for runtime use.
    It processes entries from the creature_template and related tables to build internal
    mappings between pet types, levels, and their associated learned spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadPetLevelupSpellMap();\n\
      \    // Pet spell mappings are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reloads. It's important to note that this method modifies internal data structures
    used by the pet system, so calling it after server startup may cause inconsistencies
    if not handled carefully. The method assumes that database connections and relevant
    tables are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in the pet spell mapping. It should only be
    invoked during controlled initialization phases, not during active gameplay sessions.
