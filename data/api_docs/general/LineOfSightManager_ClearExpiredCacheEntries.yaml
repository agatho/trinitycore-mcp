  signature: void LineOfSightManager::ClearExpiredCacheEntries()
documentation:
  brief: Clears expired entries from the line-of-sight cache to free up memory and
    maintain performance.
  description: The ClearExpiredCacheEntries method removes outdated or stale entries
    from the internal cache used by the LineOfSightManager. This ensures that the
    cache does not grow indefinitely and maintains optimal performance for line-of-sight
    calculations. The method is typically invoked periodically by the game engine
    to manage memory usage and prevent unnecessary data retention. It operates on
    cached line-of-sight results, removing those that have exceeded their validity
    period or are no longer relevant due to world state changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_lineOfSightManager.ClearExpiredCacheEntries();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during regular world updates. Developers should not typically need to invoke this
    manually unless implementing custom cache management logic. The expiration time
    for cached entries is determined by internal game mechanics and may vary based
    on object movement, visibility changes, or server configuration.
