  signature: std::string StatementClassifier::GetStatementName(uint32 statementId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a database statement given its unique identifier.
  description: The GetStatementName method is used to obtain the human-readable name
    associated with a specific database statement ID within the TrinityCore framework.
    This functionality is typically employed in logging, debugging, or administrative
    tools where it's necessary to identify what kind of SQL operation a particular
    statement ID represents. The method performs a lookup in an internal mapping structure
    that associates statement IDs with their corresponding names. It is commonly used
    during development and maintenance phases when analyzing database operations or
    troubleshooting issues related to SQL execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the name of the statement identified by
    the internal statement ID. If no matching statement is found, an empty string
    may be returned depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 stmtId = 1234;\nstd::string stmtName = classifier.GetStatementName(stmtId);\n\
      if (!stmtName.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Statement name: \" << stmtName\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Unknown statement ID\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal lookup table that maps statement
    IDs to names. The performance is expected to be O(1) for the lookup operation,
    assuming efficient hash-based storage. It's important to note that this method
    should only be called with valid statement IDs that are registered within the
    system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered statement ID may result
    in undefined behavior or return an empty string. Ensure that statement IDs passed
    to this method have been properly initialized and registered before calling.
