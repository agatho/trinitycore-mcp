  method: SetEncounterStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::SetEncounterStrategy(uint32 groupId, EncounterStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the encounter strategy for a specified group within a dungeon behavior
    context.
  description: The SetEncounterStrategy method configures the tactical approach that
    a dungeon encounter should follow for a given group. This method is typically
    used in the context of scripted encounters where different strategies may be applied
    based on encounter phase, player actions, or difficulty settings. The groupId
    parameter identifies which specific group within the dungeon's encounter structure
    to apply the strategy to, while the strategy parameter defines the behavior pattern
    to be implemented. This method directly influences how NPCs and game entities
    respond during encounters, affecting combat dynamics, AI decision-making, and
    overall encounter progression.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the group within the dungeon encounter. Used
      to determine which specific group's strategy should be modified. Valid values
      are typically positive integers corresponding to predefined group IDs in the
      dungeon's encounter structure.
  - name: strategy
    description: The encounter strategy to apply to the specified group. This parameter
      defines how the group should behave during the encounter, including tactics
      such as aggression level, positioning, or special abilities usage. The exact
      values and meanings depend on the implementation of EncounterStrategy enum or
      class in the TrinityCore codebase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeon = ...;

      dungeon->SetEncounterStrategy(1, ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_AGGRESSIVE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Strategy
    code: "DungeonBehavior* dungeon = ...;\nuint32 groupId = player->GetGroup()->GetId();\n\
      EncounterStrategy strategy = (player->GetDifficulty() == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\
      \ ? \n    ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_EVASIVE : ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_AGGRESSIVE;\ndungeon->SetEncounterStrategy(groupId,\
      \ strategy);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger encounter management system and may
    trigger internal state changes or event notifications. It should be called before
    the encounter begins or during specific phases to ensure proper behavior implementation.
    The actual strategy effects depend on how the EncounterStrategy enum values are
    interpreted by the AI systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may result in undefined behavior
    or failed strategy application. Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an existing
    group within the dungeon's encounter structure before calling this method. Also,
    be aware that changing strategies mid-encounter might not always produce expected
    results depending on the current state of the encounter.
