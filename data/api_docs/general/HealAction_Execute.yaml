  class: HealAction
  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult HealAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a healing action within the bot's AI context, determining and applying
    the appropriate healing strategy based on current target and bot state.
  description: The Execute method of the HealAction class is responsible for performing
    healing operations within the TrinityCore AI framework. It evaluates the current
    bot's health status, target conditions, and available healing resources to determine
    the most effective healing action. This method integrates with the broader BotAI
    system to ensure that healing decisions are made in accordance with the bot's
    role, priority settings, and combat situation. The method typically checks if
    a target needs healing, calculates whether the bot has sufficient mana or resources,
    and then executes the appropriate healing spell or ability. It returns an ActionResult
    indicating success or failure of the healing attempt, which can be used by the
    AI to make further decisions about subsequent actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionResult enum value that indicates whether the healing action
    was successful, failed, or is pending execution. Possible values may include SUCCESS,
    FAILED, or PENDING depending on the outcome of the healing attempt and the current
    state of the bot and target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Action Execution
    code: "ActionResult result = healAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Healing was successful\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Healing action completed\
      \ successfully\");\n} else if (result == ActionResult::FAILED) {\n    // Healing\
      \ failed for some reason\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Healing action failed\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of a larger AI decision-making
    loop where multiple actions are evaluated and executed. The HealAction class likely
    inherits from or works closely with other action classes in the TrinityCore AI
    system. It's important to note that healing actions may be subject to cooldowns,
    resource limitations, and target validity checks.
  warnings: The method assumes valid inputs for ai and context parameters. If these
    are not properly initialized, unexpected behavior or crashes may occur. The method
    should only be called when the bot is in a state where healing is appropriate,
    otherwise it may waste resources or conflict with other AI behaviors.
