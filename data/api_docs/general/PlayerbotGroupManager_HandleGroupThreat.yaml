documentation:
  brief: Updates threat levels for all group members in the specified group
  description: The HandleGroupThreat method processes and synchronizes threat information
    across all players within a given group. This method is typically invoked when
    group dynamics change, such as when a new enemy is engaged or when threat distribution
    needs to be recalculated. It ensures that all group members have consistent threat
    data for proper AI decision-making and combat coordination. The method operates
    on the group identified by the provided groupId parameter and updates internal
    threat tracking structures accordingly.

    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      groupMgr->HandleGroupThreat(groupId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in player bot AI systems to maintain synchronized
    threat data across group members. It may trigger additional internal updates such
    as target selection recalculations or positioning adjustments based on updated
    threat levels.
