  class: QuestCache
  method: GetActiveQuests
  signature: const int & QuestCache::GetActiveQuests() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the count of active quests in the quest cache.
  description: The GetActiveQuests method retrieves the number of currently active
    quests stored within the QuestCache instance. This value represents how many quests
    are actively being tracked or managed by the cache, typically indicating ongoing
    quest progress for players or NPCs. The method returns a constant reference to
    an integer, ensuring that the returned value cannot be modified directly through
    this interface. It is commonly used in game logic to determine the current state
    of active quests for performance optimization or UI display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the count of active quests
    in the cache. This value should never be negative and typically increases as new
    quests are added and decreases as quests are completed or removed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestCache cache;

      int activeCount = cache.GetActiveQuests();

      std::cout << "Active quests: " << activeCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Quest State for UI Updates
    code: "QuestCache* questCache = player->GetQuestCache();\nif (questCache->GetActiveQuests()\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Update UI to show active quests\n    player->SendUpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_ACTIVE_QUESTS,\
      \ questCache->GetActiveQuests());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance
    issues when called frequently. Since it returns a const reference, modifications
    to the underlying value must be done through other methods in the QuestCache class.
    The returned value reflects only the count of active quests and does not provide
    information about individual quest states or details.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestCache instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized cache may lead to undefined behavior.
    Also note that due to the const reference return type, modifying the underlying
    count through this interface is impossible, so any updates must be handled via
    dedicated setter or update methods in the class.
