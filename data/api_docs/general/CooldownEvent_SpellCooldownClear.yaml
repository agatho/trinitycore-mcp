  class: CooldownEvent
  method: SpellCooldownClear
  signature: CooldownEvent CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownClear(int caster, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the cooldown for a specified spell on the caster.
  description: The SpellCooldownClear method removes any active cooldown timer associated
    with a specific spell cast by a given caster. This function is typically used
    in game mechanics to instantly reset spell availability, such as when a player
    uses an item that removes all cooldowns or when certain abilities are triggered.
    The method operates within the TrinityCore framework and interacts with the cooldown
    system to ensure accurate spell timing and player experience. It's important to
    note that this operation affects only the specified spell and caster, leaving
    other cooldowns unaffected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a CooldownEvent object representing the cleared cooldown state
    for the specified spell and caster. This return value can be used to chain further
    cooldown-related operations or to verify that the cooldown was successfully cleared.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownClear(12345, 8000); //
      Clear cooldown for spell ID 8000 on caster with GUID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spell Effect Handler
    code: "void OnSpellEffect(Unit* caster, uint32 spellId) {\n    if (spellId ==\
      \ 12345) {\n        CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownClear(caster->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ 8000);\n        // Further processing of the cooldown clear event\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with TrinityCore's internal cooldown management
    system. It should be used carefully in performance-critical code paths as it may
    trigger additional game state updates. The method assumes that the caster GUID
    and spell ID are valid and exist in the database.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation of caster GUID or spell ID
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spell being cleared
    actually has a cooldown before calling this method, as clearing non-existent cooldowns
    may cause unexpected side effects.
