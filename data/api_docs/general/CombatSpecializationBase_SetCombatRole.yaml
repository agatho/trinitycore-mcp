  method: SetCombatRole
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::SetCombatRole(CombatRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the combat role for a specialization, determining the player's tactical
    positioning and behavior in combat.
  description: The SetCombatRole method assigns a specific combat role to a CombatSpecializationBase
    instance. This role influences how the character behaves during combat, including
    positioning, target selection, and ability usage. The method is typically used
    to configure a player's specialization for optimal performance in different combat
    scenarios such as tanking, healing, or dealing damage. It updates internal state
    variables that affect AI decision-making and spell casting behavior within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The CombatRole enum value specifying the desired tactical role for
      this specialization. Valid values include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, and others
      depending on the game's combat system implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player to Tank Role
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->SetCombatRole(CombatRole::TANK);

      // This configures the player''s specialization for tanking duties.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a Damage Dealer Role
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->SetCombatRole(CombatRole::DAMAGE_DEALER);

      // Sets up the specialization for optimal damage output.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during specialization initialization or when
    switching roles. The change takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent
    combat decisions made by the AI associated with this specialization.
  warnings: Changing combat roles at inappropriate times (e.g., during active combat)
    may lead to unexpected behavior or temporary loss of certain abilities until the
    next combat cycle.
