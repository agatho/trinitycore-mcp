  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: Reload
  signature: bool QuestHubDatabase::Reload()
documentation:
  brief: Reloads the quest hub database, refreshing all quest-related data from the
    underlying storage.
  description: The Reload method in the QuestHubDatabase class is responsible for
    refreshing and reloading all quest-related data from the database. This operation
    ensures that any changes made to the quest definitions, quest items, or related
    configurations in the database are reflected in the running TrinityCore instance.
    The method typically performs a complete reload of the quest hub's internal data
    structures, clearing existing cached data and reinitializing it with fresh data
    from the database. It is commonly used during server maintenance, debugging, or
    when quest data needs to be synchronized with the database without requiring a
    full server restart.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the reload operation was successful and all data was properly
    reloaded; returns false if there were errors during the reload process, such as
    database connection issues or corrupted data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (QuestHubDatabase::Instance()->Reload()) {\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest\
      \ hub database reloaded successfully.\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to reload quest hub database.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used with caution in production environments as it
    may cause temporary disruptions to quest-related functionality. It is recommended
    to perform this operation during low-traffic periods or maintenance windows. The
    method is typically not thread-safe and should be called from a single-threaded
    context.
  warnings: Calling Reload() while players are actively engaged in quests may result
    in inconsistent quest states or data loss. Always ensure that no active quest
    sessions are in progress before invoking this method.
