  class: Battlefield
  method: GetTypeId
  signature: int Battlefield::GetTypeId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique type identifier for the battlefield instance.
  description: The GetTypeId method retrieves the numerical type identifier associated
    with a specific Battlefield instance. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to distinguish between different types of battlefields, such as those corresponding
    to various world PvP zones or special event areas. The returned value typically
    maps to predefined constants or enums that define the battlefield's category or
    purpose within the game's PvP system. This method is commonly used for identifying
    and managing battlefield instances during PvP events, loot distribution, and player
    tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique type identifier of the battlefield.
    This value corresponds to predefined battlefield types in the game's configuration
    and is used for internal identification and management purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);

      int typeId = bf->GetTypeId();

      printf("Battlefield type ID: %d\n", typeId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Type Checking in PvP Logic
    code: "if (battlefield->GetTypeId() == BATTLEFIELD_TYPE_WG)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ Wintergrasp battlefield logic\n    battlefield->UpdateWintergrasp();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The type identifier returned by this method is typically set during the battlefield's
    initialization and remains constant throughout its lifetime. This value should
    not be modified after creation as it affects internal data structures and event
    handling.
