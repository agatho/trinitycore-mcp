  method: CalculateWeightedStatValue
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateWeightedStatValue(const StatWeights & weights,
    const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a weighted statistical value for a loot item based on provided
    stat weights.
  description: The CalculateWeightedStatValue method computes a normalized score for
    a given loot item by applying statistical weights to its attributes. This function
    is typically used in loot analysis systems to evaluate the relative value of items
    based on their stats, such as agility, strength, or spell power. The method takes
    into account the item's stat distribution and multiplies each stat by its corresponding
    weight factor before summing them up. This allows for a standardized comparison
    between different items within the same category, aiding in decision-making processes
    like loot distribution or item evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: weights
    description: A reference to a StatWeights object containing the weight factors
      for various stats. These weights determine how much each stat contributes to
      the final calculated value.
  - name: item
    description: A reference to a LootItem object representing the item whose weighted
      stat value is to be calculated. This contains the actual stat values of the
      item being evaluated.
  returns: A float value representing the computed weighted statistical value of the
    loot item. Higher values indicate items with more desirable stat combinations
    according to the provided weights.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'StatWeights weights;

      weights.agility = 1.5f;

      weights.strength = 2.0f;

      weights.intellect = 1.0f;


      LootItem item;

      item.stats[STAT_AGILITY] = 100;

      item.stats[STAT_STRENGTH] = 80;

      item.stats[STAT_INTELLECT] = 60;


      float value = lootAnalysis.CalculateWeightedStatValue(weights, item);

      // Returns a weighted sum based on the provided weights and item stats'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the StatWeights object has been properly initialized
    with valid weight values. The calculation is performed using floating-point arithmetic,
    so results may vary slightly due to precision limitations. Performance-wise, this
    method should be relatively fast as it only involves basic arithmetic operations
    on stat values.
