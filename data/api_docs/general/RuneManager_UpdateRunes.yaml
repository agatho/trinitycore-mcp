documentation:
  brief: Updates the state and cooldowns of player runes
  description: The UpdateRunes method manages the internal state of a player's runes,
    including their cooldown timers and availability. This method is typically called
    during game ticks to process rune regeneration and update their status. It ensures
    that runes become available for use when their cooldown periods expire and handles
    the transition between used and unused states. The method operates on the RuneManager's
    internal rune data structure and updates the player's rune state accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateRunes Call
    code: "void UpdateRunes(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Called every game tick to update\
      \ rune states\n    if (diff > 0)\n    {\n        // Process rune cooldowns and\
      \ regeneration\n        for (int i = 0; i < MAX_RUNES; ++i)\n        {\n   \
      \         if (m_runes[i].Cooldown > 0)\n                m_runes[i].Cooldown\
      \ = std::max(0u, m_runes[i].Cooldown - diff);\n            else if (!m_runes[i].Ready)\n\
      \                m_runes[i].Ready = true;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during game loop updates to maintain
    accurate rune state. It's typically invoked by the player's update function or
    through a dedicated game tick handler. The implementation may vary based on the
    specific class hierarchy and rune system design in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can cause incorrect rune cooldown
    calculations. Ensure this method is called with accurate time deltas to maintain
    proper gameplay balance and prevent exploits related to rune regeneration timing.
