  method: UpdateStatistics
  signature: void QuestManager::UpdateStatistics(const Quest * quest, bool completed)
documentation:
  brief: Updates quest statistics for a player when a quest is completed or updated.
  description: The UpdateStatistics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    quest-related statistics within the QuestManager class. This method is typically
    invoked when a player completes a quest or when there's a change in quest progress.
    It ensures that internal tracking mechanisms are synchronized with the current
    state of the quest, which may include updating completion times, player progress
    metrics, or other statistical data associated with the quest. The method plays
    a crucial role in maintaining accurate quest data for both client-side display
    and server-side processing.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that is being updated. This parameter
      must not be null and should point to a valid quest instance within the game's
      quest system.
  - name: completed
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the quest has been completed (true)
      or is in progress (false). This determines how the statistics are updated and
      which internal tracking mechanisms are triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Statistics for Completed Quest
    code: 'QuestManager* questMgr = player->GetQuestManager();

      const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      questMgr->UpdateStatistics(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Statistics for In-Progress Quest
    code: 'QuestManager* questMgr = player->GetQuestManager();

      const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      questMgr->UpdateStatistics(quest, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    quest states change. Developers should not need to call this directly unless implementing
    custom quest logic or extending the quest management functionality. The method
    may trigger additional events or callbacks depending on how the QuestManager is
    implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest parameter passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method should only be called during appropriate game states where quest data
    can be safely modified.
