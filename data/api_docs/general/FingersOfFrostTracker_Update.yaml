  class: FingersOfFrostTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FingersOfFrostTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Fingers of Frost tracker state for the specified player.
  description: The Update method manages the internal state of the Fingers of Frost
    tracker, which monitors and controls the application and removal of the Fingers
    of Frost buff on a player character. This method is typically invoked during combat
    or spell casting events to ensure proper tracking of the buff's duration and effects.
    It handles logic for when the buff should be applied, refreshed, or removed based
    on game mechanics such as spell usage, damage dealt, or time-based expiration.
    The method operates on the provided Player object and modifies its internal tracker
    state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose Fingers of Frost tracker state
      will be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void SomeAI::OnSpellCast(Player* player)\n{\n    fingersOfFrostTracker.Update(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Events
    code: "void CombatHandler::HandlePlayerAttack(Player* attacker)\n{\n    if (attacker->HasAura(SPELL_FINGERS_OF_FROST))\n\
      \    {\n        fingersOfFrostTracker.Update(attacker);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the AI or combat system
    logic. It assumes that the Player object passed has been validated and contains
    valid aura data. The implementation may involve checking for existing buffs, updating
    timers, and potentially triggering additional effects based on the tracker's state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method modifies internal state of the player's
    Fingers of Frost tracker and should not be called in contexts where concurrent
    access might occur without proper synchronization.
