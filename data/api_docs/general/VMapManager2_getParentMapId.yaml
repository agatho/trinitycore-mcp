  signature: int32 VMapManager2::getParentMapId(uint32 mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the parent map ID for a given map ID in the VMap system.
  description: The getParentMapId method is used to determine the parent map identifier
    for a specified map within the TrinityCore's VMap (Virtual Map) system. This functionality
    is essential for handling hierarchical map relationships, particularly when dealing
    with instances or submaps that are part of a larger world map. The method takes
    a map ID as input and returns the corresponding parent map ID, which can be useful
    for managing map-specific data structures, navigation logic, or instance-related
    operations. It operates within the VMapManager2 class context and is typically
    used during map loading, instance handling, or collision detection processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the parent map ID. If the provided
    map ID does not have a parent (i.e., it's a root map), the method may return the
    same map ID or a special sentinel value indicating no parent exists. The return
    value is guaranteed to be a valid map identifier within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapManager = VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      int32 parentMapId = vmapManager->getParentMapId(1234);

      // parentMapId will contain the parent map ID of map 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the VMap system which handles virtual map data for
    collision detection and line-of-sight calculations. The implementation likely
    relies on internal map hierarchy tables or configuration files that define parent-child
    relationships between maps. Performance-wise, this operation should be relatively
    fast as it's expected to involve simple lookups in an internal data structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the input map ID is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    IDs might cause undefined behavior or return unexpected results. This method should
    not be called during map loading phases where the hierarchy data might not yet
    be fully initialized.
