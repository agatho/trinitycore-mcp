  method: Test
  signature: bool NearestCheckCustomizer::Test(const int * o) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given object meets specific criteria for inclusion in
    a nearest-neighbor search.
  description: The Test method performs a custom evaluation on an object to determine
    if it satisfies certain conditions required for inclusion in a nearest-neighbor
    search operation. This method is typically used within the context of AI pathfinding
    or target selection logic, where specific objects must meet predefined requirements
    before being considered as valid candidates. The method accepts a pointer to an
    integer representing some internal identifier or state of the object and returns
    true if the object passes all checks, false otherwise. It is commonly invoked
    during traversal of potential targets in systems like threat management, NPC behavior
    trees, or unit selection logic.
  parameters:
  - name: o
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the object's identifier or state
      value. This parameter is used internally by the customizer to evaluate whether
      the object meets specific criteria for inclusion in a nearest-neighbor search.
  returns: Returns true if the object pointed to by 'o' satisfies all conditions defined
    in this customizer, indicating it should be included in the nearest-neighbor search.
    Returns false otherwise, meaning the object does not meet the required criteria
    and will be excluded from consideration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in target selection
    code: "NearestCheckCustomizer customizer;\nint targetId = 12345;\nbool isValidTarget\
      \ = customizer.Test(&targetId);\nif (isValidTarget) {\n    // Proceed with pathfinding\
      \ or targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a customizable filtering system that allows developers
    to define specific rules for object inclusion in nearest-neighbor searches. It's
    commonly used in AI systems where certain conditions must be met before an object
    can be considered as a valid target or path point.
