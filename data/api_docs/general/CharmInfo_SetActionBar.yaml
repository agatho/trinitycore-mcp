  class: CharmInfo
  method: SetActionBar
  signature: void CharmInfo::SetActionBar(uint8 index, uint32 spellOrAction, ActiveStates
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets an action bar entry for a charm with the specified spell or action.
  description: The SetActionBar method configures a specific slot on a charm's action
    bar, allowing the charm to use a particular spell or action. This method is typically
    used in the context of summoned creatures or pets that have their own action bars.
    The index parameter specifies which slot to update, spellOrAction defines what
    the slot will contain (either a spell ID or an action), and type indicates whether
    the entry represents a spell or an action state. This functionality is essential
    for controlling how summoned units interact with the player's commands and abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The action bar slot index (0-11) to update. Valid values are typically
      from 0 to 11, representing the 12 available slots on a charm's action bar.
  - name: spellOrAction
    description: The spell ID or action identifier to assign to the specified slot.
      For spells, this is the SpellID; for actions, it may be an action type or identifier
      depending on the implementation.
  - name: type
    description: The active state type indicating whether the entry represents a spell
      or an action. This determines how the game interprets and handles the spellOrAction
      parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Spell on Action Bar
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetActionBar(0, 12345, ACT_SPELL); // Sets slot 0 to use spell ID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting an Action on Action Bar
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetActionBar(5, 67890, ACT_ACTION); // Sets slot 5 to use action
      ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the charm's action bar state and should be
    called carefully during appropriate game events or transitions. The charm must
    be valid and active for changes to take effect properly.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid index values (outside 0-11 range) may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spellOrAction parameter
    is valid for the given type to avoid runtime errors.
