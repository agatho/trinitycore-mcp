  signature: LootItemStorage & LootItemStorage::operator=(LootItemStorage && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LootItemStorage object to this instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the LootItemStorage
    class, transferring all resources and data from the source LootItemStorage object
    to the current object. This is typically used in scenarios where temporary or
    intermediate loot item collections need to be efficiently transferred without
    unnecessary copying. The method ensures that the source object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this would commonly be used when handling loot distribution, particularly
    during item generation and assignment processes where performance optimization
    is critical.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LootItemStorage object, allowing for chaining
    of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LootItemStorage storage1;

      LootItemStorage storage2 = std::move(storage1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      storage1 = std::move(storage2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Loot Distribution Context
    code: 'LootItemStorage lootItems;

      // ... populate lootItems with items ...

      LootItemStorage finalLoot;

      finalLoot = std::move(lootItems); // Efficiently transfer loot to final container

      // lootItems is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which is crucial for performance optimization
    when dealing with large collections of loot items. The move operation typically
    involves transferring pointers or handles rather than copying data, making it
    much faster than copy operations. Developers should be aware that after a move
    assignment, the source object should not be used in any way that might access
    its former contents.
  warnings: After performing a move assignment, the source object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state. Using the source object afterward may lead to undefined
    behavior or unexpected results. Ensure all references to the moved-from object
    are discarded before using it further.
