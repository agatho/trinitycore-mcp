documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific quest objective has been completed by the player.
  description: This method determines whether a given quest objective has been completed
    by the player, returning true if the objective is complete and false otherwise.
    It is commonly used in quest scripting and quest completion logic to verify that
    specific objectives have been met. The method operates on the player's current
    quest progress data, checking against the quest's objective requirements. This
    functionality is essential for determining if a player has fulfilled all required
    objectives for a quest before allowing quest completion or advancement.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being checked. This represents
      the quest ID from the database, typically used to identify which quest's objective
      is being evaluated.
  - name: objectiveId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific quest objective being checked.
      This represents the objective ID from the database, typically used to identify
      which specific objective within a quest is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective has been completed by the
    player, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the player has
    met the required criteria for that particular objective, while false means the
    objective remains incomplete.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsQuestObjectiveComplete(12345, 1))\n{\n    // Do something\
      \ when objective is complete\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple objectives
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 objectiveId = 1;\nif (player->IsQuestObjectiveComplete(questId,\
      \ objectiveId))\n{\n    // Check if the player has completed this specific objective\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine overall quest completion status. It operates on the player's current
    quest progress data and may not reflect future or pending objectives. The method
    is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations for usage.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking quest completion, as
    it only checks specific objectives rather than entire quests. If the objective
    ID is incorrect or the quest ID is invalid, this method may return false results.
    Also, this method does not account for quest objectives that might have been completed
    in previous sessions or through other means.
