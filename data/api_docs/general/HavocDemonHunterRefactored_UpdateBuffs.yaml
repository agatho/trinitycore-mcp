documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Havoc Demon Hunter
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all active buffs and debuffs that affect the Havoc Demon Hunter character.
    This includes checking buff expiration times, applying new buff effects, removing
    expired buffs, and ensuring the player's status effects are accurately reflected
    in the game world. The method typically runs during each update cycle to maintain
    real-time status effect synchronization with the TrinityCore server mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HavocDemonHunterAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ AI logic ...\n    m_player->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during each update
    cycle. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom
    buff management logic. The method may trigger additional callbacks or events when
    buff states change.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs manually outside of the standard AI update flow may
    cause unexpected behavior or desynchronization with server state. This method
    modifies player status effects and should only be invoked in appropriate contexts
    where game state changes are properly handled.
