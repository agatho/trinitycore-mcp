documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CrowdControlManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CrowdControlManager class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any internal data structures, removing references to active
    crowd control effects, and ensuring proper deallocation of dynamically allocated
    memory. The destructor is automatically invoked when a CrowdControlManager instance
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur
    and that all ongoing crowd control operations are properly terminated before the
    object is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of CrowdControlManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CrowdControlManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when manager goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of CrowdControlManager
    code: 'CrowdControlManager* manager = new CrowdControlManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor

      manager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    with pointers. It's important to ensure that all references to the CrowdControlManager
    are cleared before destruction to prevent dangling pointers. The destructor may
    perform cleanup operations that could affect other systems, so it should be called
    only when the object is no longer needed.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as this
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all dependent systems are properly notified
    of the manager's destruction before it occurs. Be cautious with virtual destructors
    in inheritance hierarchies involving CrowdControlManager.
