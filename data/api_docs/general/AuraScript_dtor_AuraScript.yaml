documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuraScript instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The AuraScript destructor is automatically invoked when an AuraScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, references to game objects, or internal
    data structures that the AuraScript may have acquired during its lifetime. In
    the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this destructor plays a critical role
    in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable gameplay when auras are removed
    or expire. The destruction process typically involves cleaning up internal state,
    notifying subsystems of the aura's removal, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain in the system.

  - title: Basic AuraScript Destruction
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect, AuraApplication const* app) override\n    {\n        // Custom\
      \ logic on aura apply\n    }\n\n    ~MyAuraScript() override\n    {\n      \
      \  // Cleanup logic if needed\n    }\n};\n\n// When the aura expires or is removed,\
      \ this destructor is called automatically"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is virtual in the base AuraScript class, allowing proper polymorphic
    destruction of derived classes. Developers should ensure that any custom cleanup
    logic in derived destructors does not access other objects that may have already
    been destroyed or are in an inconsistent state.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you're implementing a custom
    memory management scheme. The destructor should never be called directly on stack-allocated
    instances, as this leads to undefined behavior. Also, avoid performing operations
    in destructors that might throw exceptions, as it can lead to program termination.
