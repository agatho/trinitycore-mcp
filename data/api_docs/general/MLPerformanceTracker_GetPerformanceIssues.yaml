documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of performance issues detected by the machine learning tracker
  description: The GetPerformanceIssues method returns a vector of strings describing
    performance problems identified by the MLPerformanceTracker. This method is typically
    used to gather diagnostic information about potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies
    in game systems that are monitored by machine learning algorithms. The returned
    issues may include warnings about high CPU usage, memory leaks, inefficient database
    queries, or other performance-related anomalies detected during runtime. The tracker
    must have been initialized and have collected data for this method to return meaningful
    results.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing human-readable descriptions of performance
    issues detected by the MLPerformanceTracker. Each string represents a distinct
    performance problem that may require investigation or optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n// ... tracker is initialized and has collected\
      \ data ...\nstd::vector<std::string> issues = tracker.GetPerformanceIssues();\n\
      for (const auto& issue : issues) {\n    std::cout << \"Performance Issue: \"\
      \ << issue << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called periodically during server maintenance
    or diagnostic routines. The returned vector may be empty if no performance issues
    have been detected since the last analysis cycle. The MLPerformanceTracker should
    be running in a background thread to continuously monitor system performance without
    affecting main game loop execution.
  warnings: Calling this method while the tracker is actively analyzing data may return
    inconsistent results. Ensure that the tracker has completed its analysis cycle
    before calling this method for accurate diagnostics.
