  class: QuestCompletion
  method: NavigateToObjective
  signature: void QuestCompletion::NavigateToObjective(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Instructs a bot player to navigate to a specific quest objective location.
  description: The NavigateToObjective method is responsible for guiding a bot player
    to the designated quest objective within the World of Warcraft environment. This
    method utilizes the TrinityCore AI and movement systems to calculate and execute
    pathfinding towards the specified objective coordinates or entity. It ensures
    that the bot moves efficiently and realistically through the game world, potentially
    interacting with waypoints, NPCs, or environmental triggers along the way. The
    method assumes that the player is already engaged in a quest and that the provided
    objective data contains valid location information or target identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will navigate to the objective. This player must be active and in a valid state
      for movement operations.
  - name: objective
    description: A constant reference to QuestObjectiveData which contains information
      about the quest objective, including its type, target location, or associated
      entity ID required for navigation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation Example
    code: "void example() {\n    Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\n \
      \   QuestObjectiveData objective;\n    objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_LOCATION;\n\
      \    objective.location = {1234.5f, 6789.0f, 100.0f};\n    QuestCompletion::NavigateToObjective(bot,\
      \ objective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the underlying pathfinding system of TrinityCore
    and may not work correctly if the bot's movement flags are disabled or if the
    objective location is invalid. It is recommended to validate the objective data
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the bot is in a valid quest state
    or with malformed objective data can lead to undefined behavior or client-side
    errors. Always verify that the player is logged in and the objective has valid
    coordinates or target information.
