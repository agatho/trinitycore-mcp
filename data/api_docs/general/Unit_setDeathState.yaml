  class: Unit
  method: setDeathState
  signature: void Unit::setDeathState(DeathState s)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the death state of the unit to specified state.
  description: The setDeathState method is used to change the death state of a Unit
    object, which determines whether the unit is alive, dead, or in a specific state
    of death. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to control the behavior
    of creatures or players when they die or are resurrected. The DeathState parameter
    defines the exact state the unit should be set to, including states like 'DeathState'
    and 'DeathState' for different scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: s
    description: The DeathState value that specifies the current death state of the
      unit. This parameter determines whether the unit is in a normal death state,
      temporary death state, or other specific death states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->setDeathState(DeathState::DEATH_STATE_NORMAL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->setDeathState(DeathState::DEATH_STATE_DEAD);

      // This will set the unit to dead state, causing it to be removed from world

      // if it''s a player or creature that dies and is not resurrected.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is in a valid state for death.
    The implementation typically involves updating internal flags and potentially
    triggering events related to death state changes. It's important to note that
    this method does not actually kill the unit, but rather sets its death state.
  warnings: The method may cause unexpected behavior if used incorrectly, particularly
    when setting death states during combat or when the unit is already dead. Care
    should be taken to ensure that the death state is properly handled and that the
    unit's state is correctly updated.
