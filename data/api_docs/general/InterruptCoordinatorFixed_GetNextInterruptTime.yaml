  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: GetNextInterruptTime
  signature: uint32 InterruptCoordinatorFixed::GetNextInterruptTime(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the next interrupt time for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetNextInterruptTime method determines the next time an interrupt
    event should occur for a given bot identified by its GUID. This is typically used
    in AI systems to schedule or manage interrupt-based behaviors such as spell casting
    interruptions, movement halts, or other timed actions within the game world. The
    method does not take any direct parameters beyond the bot GUID and returns a uint32
    value representing the time in milliseconds since the system's start (or similar
    time reference) when the next interrupt should be processed. It is assumed that
    this method is part of a larger interrupt coordination system that manages timing
    and sequencing of events for multiple bots or AI entities.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to calculate the
      next interrupt time. This value must be a valid GUID representing an existing
      bot in the system.
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the absolute time (in milliseconds) when the
    next interrupt should occur for the specified bot. If no interrupt is scheduled,
    it may return 0 or a default value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 nextInterruptTime = interruptCoordinator->GetNextInterruptTime(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Loop
    code: "if (getMSTime() >= interruptCoordinator->GetNextInterruptTime(botGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Perform interrupt action\n    HandleInterrupt(botGuid);\n    //\
      \ Schedule next interrupt\n    interruptCoordinator->SetNextInterruptTime(botGuid,\
      \ getMSTime() + 5000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a fixed-interval or deterministic interrupt
    system. The return value represents a future timestamp and should be compared
    against current time using functions like getMSTime(). The method is marked as
    const, implying it does not modify internal state but may rely on cached or computed
    values.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid passed to this method corresponds to an active
    bot in the system; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Misusing this method can
    lead to incorrect timing of AI behaviors or missed interrupt events.
