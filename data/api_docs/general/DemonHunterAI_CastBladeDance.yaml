  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CastBladeDance
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastBladeDance(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Blade Dance ability for a Demon Hunter AI unit.
  description: The CastBladeDance method executes the Blade Dance spell cast by a
    Demon Hunter AI controller. This ability typically deals damage in a cone-shaped
    area around the caster and may apply specific effects such as generating Fury
    or consuming resources. The method selects an appropriate target from the available
    enemies within range, ensuring optimal positioning and targeting logic for effective
    gameplay. It is designed to be called during combat situations where the Demon
    Hunter's primary damage-dealing ability should be executed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that will be affected by Blade Dance.
      The method uses this pointer to determine which enemy to cast the spell on,
      and may modify or validate the target before execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastBladeDance
    code: 'DemonHunterAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(unit->GetAI());

      Unit* target = unit->GetVictim();

      ai->CastBladeDance(&target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CastBladeDance with custom targeting logic
    code: "DemonHunterAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(unit->GetAI());\n\
      Unit* target = nullptr;\nif (unit->GetVictim()) {\n    target = unit->GetVictim();\n\
      } else {\n    // Find a suitable target in range\n    target = ai->SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM,\
      \ 0, 10.0f, true);\n}\nai->CastBladeDance(&target);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Demon Hunter unit has sufficient resource (such
    as Fury) to cast Blade Dance. It also requires that the target is within the spell's
    range and line of sight. The AI implementation may include additional checks for
    cooldowns or other conditions before casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed into this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior might occur. Also, note that calling this method
    outside of combat context may result in unexpected behavior or failure to cast
    the spell.
