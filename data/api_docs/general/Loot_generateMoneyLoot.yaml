  class: Loot
  method: generateMoneyLoot
  signature: void Loot::generateMoneyLoot(uint32 minAmount, uint32 maxAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates random monetary loot within specified bounds for a loot object.
  description: The generateMoneyLoot method creates a random amount of gold as loot,
    within the range defined by minAmount and maxAmount parameters. This method is
    typically used in the context of creature or object looting mechanics to determine
    how much money should be dropped when an item is successfully looted. The generated
    amount is added to the loot's monetary component, which can then be distributed
    among players who participate in the loot roll. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly interact with player inventory or distribution logic;
    it only sets up the monetary value for the loot entry.
  parameters:
  - name: minAmount
    description: The minimum amount of gold (in copper) that can be generated as loot.
      Must be a non-negative integer.
  - name: maxAmount
    description: The maximum amount of gold (in copper) that can be generated as loot.
      Must be a non-negative integer and should be greater than or equal to minAmount.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Loot* loot = new Loot();

      loot->generateMoneyLoot(100, 500); // Generates between 100 and 500 copper'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'uint32 minGold = playerLevel * 100;

      uint32 maxGold = playerLevel * 500;

      loot->generateMoneyLoot(minGold, maxGold); // Scales loot based on player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal monetary value of the Loot object. It should
    be called before any loot distribution logic to ensure that the generated money
    is properly accounted for. The method does not perform any validation on the input
    parameters, so it's up to the caller to ensure minAmount <= maxAmount.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., maxAmount < minAmount)
    may lead to unexpected behavior or zero loot generation. Ensure that both parameters
    are valid and within reasonable bounds for your game mechanics.
