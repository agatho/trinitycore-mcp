  class: AuctionHouse
  method: UpdateSuccessRates
  signature: void AuctionHouse::UpdateSuccessRates(int * player, bool wasSuccessful,
    AuctionActionType actionType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the success rates for auction actions based on player performance
    and action type.
  description: The UpdateSuccessRates method is responsible for adjusting the probability
    or success rate of auction-related actions within the AuctionHouse system. It
    takes into account whether a specific auction action was successful, the player
    involved, and the type of auction action performed. This mechanism helps maintain
    game balance by dynamically modifying auction outcomes based on historical performance
    data. The method likely influences factors such as bid success rates, item listing
    probabilities, or other auction house mechanics that depend on player behavior
    and historical success/failure patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) involved
      in the auction action. This parameter identifies which player's success rates
      are being updated.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the auction action was successful
      (true) or failed (false). This determines how the success rate is adjusted for
      the given player.
  - name: actionType
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of auction action performed.
      This could include actions like listing an item, placing a bid, or canceling
      an auction, each potentially affecting different success rate calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Success Rate for Successful Bid
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      int playerId = 12345;

      bool success = true;

      AuctionActionType action = AUCTION_ACTION_BID;

      ah->UpdateSuccessRates(&playerId, success, action);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Success Rate for Failed Listing
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      int playerId = 54321;

      bool success = false;

      AuctionActionType action = AUCTION_ACTION_LIST;

      ah->UpdateSuccessRates(&playerId, success, action);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that tracks player behavior
    and adjusts game mechanics accordingly. It may be called from various auction-related
    functions within the AuctionHouse class or through external systems when auction
    actions are completed. The implementation might involve statistical models or
    simple counters to track success/failure rates over time.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying this method's logic as it directly
    impacts player experience and game economy balance. Incorrect adjustments could
    lead to either too easy or too difficult auction mechanics, affecting player engagement
    and server economy.
