api:
  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::Initialize(int marketId, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BlackMarketEntry with the specified market ID and duration.
  description: The Initialize method sets up a BlackMarketEntry object by assigning
    it a market identifier and a duration value. This method is typically called during
    the creation or setup phase of a black market auction entry within the TrinityCore
    framework. The market ID identifies which specific black market instance this
    entry belongs to, while the duration determines how long the auction will remain
    active. Proper initialization ensures that the black market entry can correctly
    participate in auction mechanics and time-based events.
  parameters:
  - name: marketId
    description: An integer identifier specifying the black market instance this entry
      belongs to. Valid values are typically positive integers corresponding to registered
      black market IDs in the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: An integer representing the duration (in seconds) for which the black
      market auction will remain active. This value controls how long players can
      bid on the item before the auction concludes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      entry.Initialize(12345, 3600); // Initialize with market ID 12345 and 1 hour
      duration'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Initialization Based on Configuration
    code: 'uint32 marketId = sWorld->getWowConfig()->GetIntDefault("BlackMarket.MarketId",
      0);

      uint32 duration = sWorld->getWowConfig()->GetIntDefault("BlackMarket.Duration",
      1800);

      BlackMarketEntry entry;

      entry.Initialize(marketId, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to use the BlackMarketEntry
    in auction operations. The market ID must correspond to a valid black market instance
    already registered in the game world. Duration values should be validated to ensure
    they fall within acceptable ranges for auction mechanics.
  warnings: Calling Initialize with invalid market IDs or negative duration values
    may lead to undefined behavior or failed auction operations. Ensure that all initialization
    parameters are properly validated before calling this method.
