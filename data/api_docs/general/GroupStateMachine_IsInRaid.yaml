  method: IsInRaid
  signature: bool GroupStateMachine::IsInRaid() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is currently in a raid configuration.
  description: The IsInRaid method checks if the current group state represents a
    raid group as opposed to a normal party. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    groups can exist in either a standard party format (with up to 5 players) or a
    raid format (with up to 40 players). This method returns true when the group is
    configured as a raid, and false otherwise. The check typically involves examining
    internal group flags or member counts to determine the group's organizational
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is currently configured as a raid (containing
    40 players), or false if it is a standard party (containing 1-5 players).
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group is in Raid
    code: "if (group->IsInRaid())\n{\n    // Handle raid-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group is in raid mode.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle party-specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Group is in party mode.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state management of the GroupStateMachine
    and should only be called on valid group objects. It does not perform any network
    synchronization or validation beyond checking the current group configuration.
