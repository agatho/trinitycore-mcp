  method: ~CorpseReferenceGuard
  signature: void CorpseReferenceGuard::~CorpseReferenceGuard()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CorpseReferenceGuard instance, releasing any held reference to
    a corpse.
  description: The ~CorpseReferenceGuard destructor is responsible for cleaning up
    and releasing any reference that was being held by this guard object. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, corpse references are often managed
    using reference guards to prevent dangling pointers and ensure proper cleanup
    when objects go out of scope. This destructor ensures that the referenced corpse
    is properly released, allowing the system to manage memory and references correctly
    without causing memory leaks or invalid access errors.

  - title: Basic Usage in a Function Scope
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CorpseReferenceGuard guard;\n    // ... some\
      \ operations with the guard\n    // Destructor automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked automatically when a CorpseReferenceGuard
    object goes out of scope. It's important to understand that this class likely
    implements RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles, ensuring
    automatic cleanup of references.
