  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetBotAssignment
  signature: const BotThreatAssignment * ThreatCoordinator::GetBotAssignment(int botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threat assignment for a specified bot GUID from the ThreatCoordinator.
  description: The GetBotAssignment method retrieves a const pointer to a BotThreatAssignment
    object associated with the given bot GUID. This method is used within the TrinityCore
    AI system to access specific threat management data for individual bots. The returned
    pointer may be null if no assignment exists for the specified GUID, indicating
    that the bot has not been assigned any threat-related tasks or has not yet been
    initialized in the threat coordination system. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is safe for read-only access.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose threat assignment is
      to be retrieved. Must be a valid GUID that corresponds to an existing bot in
      the system.
  returns: A const pointer to the BotThreatAssignment object associated with the provided
    bot GUID, or nullptr if no assignment exists for the specified GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const BotThreatAssignment* assignment = threatCoordinator->GetBotAssignment(12345);\n\
      if (assignment != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the threat assignment\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot has threat assignment: \" << assignment->GetTargetGuid() << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no assignment exists\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"No threat assignment found for bot.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using the provided GUID, which may
    involve internal data structure traversal. It is recommended to cache results
    if this method is called frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
