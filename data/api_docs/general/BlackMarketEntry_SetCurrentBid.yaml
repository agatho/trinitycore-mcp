api:
  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: SetCurrentBid
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::SetCurrentBid(int bid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current bid amount for a black market item entry.
  description: The SetCurrentBid method updates the current highest bid value for
    a specific black market auction entry. This method is typically used during auction
    processing to track the most recent bid placed on an item. The method does not
    validate whether the new bid exceeds the minimum required increment or if it's
    higher than the previous bid, as those checks are usually handled by the auction
    system before calling this method. It directly assigns the provided bid value
    to the internal current bid field of the BlackMarketEntry object.
  parameters:
  - name: bid
    description: The new bid amount to set as the current highest bid for this black
      market entry. This should be a positive integer representing the bid value in
      copper coins.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a new bid on a black market item
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    entry->SetCurrentBid(50000); // Set current bid to 5 gold\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating bid during auction processing loop
    code: "for (auto& entry : sBlackMarketMgr->GetAllBlackMarketEntries())\n{\n  \
      \  if (entry->GetAuctionTime() <= sWorld->GetGameTime())\n    {\n        //\
      \ Process auction end\n        uint32 newBid = CalculateNewBid(entry);\n   \
      \     entry->SetCurrentBid(newBid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment without validation. It's recommended
    to validate bid increments and other auction rules before calling this method.
    The method is not thread-safe and should be called within appropriate lock contexts
    if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative bid value may cause unexpected behavior
    or overflow issues. Ensure that all bids are validated against the auction house's
    minimum increment rules before setting them using this method.
