  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: PrioritizeCrowdControl
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::PrioritizeCrowdControl(const int & mobs)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the behavior manager to prioritize crowd control abilities when
    targeting mobs.
  description: The PrioritizeCrowdControl method adjusts the AI behavior of a creature
    or NPC to focus on applying crowd control effects before other actions when engaging
    with mob targets. This is typically used in advanced AI scripting to ensure that
    abilities like stun, fear, or root are applied strategically during combat encounters.
    The method modifies internal priority settings within the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    to influence decision-making logic. It does not directly cast spells but rather
    sets up the behavioral framework for when and how crowd control abilities should
    be prioritized.
  parameters:
  - name: mobs
    description: An integer value representing the number of mobs to prioritize crowd
      control against. This parameter likely influences the threshold or priority
      level at which crowd control becomes a primary focus in combat decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = new AdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->PrioritizeCrowdControl(3); // Prioritize crowd control against
      3 or more mobs'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Priority Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustCrowdControlPriority(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 5)\n        behaviorManager->PrioritizeCrowdControl(5);\n    else\n    \
      \    behaviorManager->PrioritizeCrowdControl(2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before combat begins to properly initialize
    the AI's behavior. The 'mobs' parameter likely affects how many targets must be
    present for crowd control to become a high-priority action, and may also influence
    cooldown management or spell selection logic.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat may cause unpredictable behavior
    in AI decision-making. Ensure that all prior configuration is complete before
    initiating combat scenarios.
