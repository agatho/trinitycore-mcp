documentation:
  brief: Returns the GuildRankId of the lowest-ranked guild member.
  description: The _GetLowestRankId method retrieves the unique identifier for the
    lowest rank within a guild. In World of Warcraft's guild system, ranks are ordered
    from highest to lowest (e.g., Guild Master is rank 0, while members may be at
    rank 1 or higher). This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to determine which rank has the least privileges and can be useful for
    access control checks or administrative operations. The returned value represents
    the numerical ID of the lowest rank in the guild's rank hierarchy.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GuildRankId representing the unique identifier of the lowest-ranked guild
    member. This is typically a numeric value that corresponds to an index in the
    guild's rank list, where higher numbers indicate lower ranks.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve lowest rank ID for a guild
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n\
      \    GuildRankId lowestRank = myGuild->_GetLowestRankId();\n    // Use lowestRank\
      \ to check permissions or perform administrative tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as private (_), indicating it's intended for internal
    use within the Guild class or related systems. It should not be called directly
    from external code unless absolutely necessary and properly understood.
  warnings: Because this is a private method, calling it externally may lead to undefined
    behavior or break encapsulation principles. Ensure that any usage aligns with
    the intended internal logic of the TrinityCore server.
