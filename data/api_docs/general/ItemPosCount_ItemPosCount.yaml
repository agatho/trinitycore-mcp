  class: ItemPosCount
  method: ItemPosCount
  signature: void ItemPosCount::ItemPosCount(uint16 _pos, uint32 _count)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ItemPosCount object with the specified inventory position
    and item count.
  description: The ItemPosCount constructor initializes a new instance of the ItemPosCount
    class, setting its internal position and count values. This class is typically
    used in TrinityCore's item management system to represent a specific slot in an
    inventory along with the number of items contained in that slot. The position
    parameter usually corresponds to an inventory slot index, while the count represents
    how many items are present at that location. This constructor is commonly called
    when processing item transactions, such as adding or removing items from a player's
    inventory, or during item distribution operations within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: _pos
    description: The inventory position (slot index) where the item is located. This
      value typically represents a specific slot in an item container such as a player's
      backpack, bank, or equipment slots.
  - name: _count
    description: The number of items currently in the specified inventory position.
      This count can be zero for empty slots or any positive integer representing
      the quantity of items stacked at that location.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an ItemPosCount for a single item in slot 20
    code: 'ItemPosCount posCount(20, 1);

      // Represents one item in inventory slot 20'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an ItemPosCount for a stack of items in slot 5
    code: 'ItemPosCount posCount(5, 42);

      // Represents 42 items in inventory slot 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the ItemPosCount class which is used internally
    by TrinityCore's item handling system. The position value should be validated
    against valid inventory slot ranges before use to prevent out-of-bounds access.
    This class does not perform any automatic validation of its parameters, so callers
    must ensure that _pos and _count are within acceptable bounds for the context
    in which they're used.
  warnings: Using invalid position values (e.g., beyond maximum inventory slots) can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that _pos corresponds to a valid
    slot index before creating an ItemPosCount object. The count parameter should
    not be negative, though negative values may be accepted depending on implementation
    details.
