  class: DPSPositioning
  method: CalculateDPSScore
  signature: float DPSPositioning::CalculateDPSScore(const int & pos, Player * dps,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a damage per second (DPS) score for a player based
    on their positioning within a combat context.
  description: The CalculateDPSScore method evaluates a player's effectiveness in
    terms of DPS by analyzing their position relative to targets and environmental
    factors defined in the CombatPositionContext. This function is typically used
    in AI-driven combat systems or performance analysis modules to determine how optimal
    a player's positioning is for maximizing damage output. The score is derived from
    various metrics such as distance to target, line of sight, threat distribution,
    and other contextual combat data. It assumes that the player is actively engaged
    in combat and that the context provides sufficient information about the current
    battlefield state.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the positional index or identifier used to
      determine the player's location within the combat scenario. This value may correspond
      to a specific point in space, a predefined position marker, or an internal index
      for positioning logic.
  - name: dps
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose DPS score is being calculated.
      The method evaluates how effectively this player is positioned to deal damage
      based on the provided context.
  - name: context
    description: A reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing all relevant
      data about the current combat environment, including target positions, obstacles,
      threat levels, and other situational factors that influence positioning effectiveness.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated DPS score. A higher score
    indicates better positioning for maximizing damage output. Scores may be normalized
    or weighted depending on internal logic but generally range from 0.0 (worst possible
    position) to 1.0 (optimal position).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float score = dpsPositioning.CalculateDPSScore(5, player, combatContext);\n\
      if (score > 0.8f)\n{\n    // Player is in an optimal position for DPS\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "const int playerPosition = 3;\nPlayer* currentPlayer = ...; // Assume valid\
      \ player pointer\nCombatPositionContext context = GetCombatContext();\nfloat\
      \ dpsScore = dpsPositioning.CalculateDPSScore(playerPosition, currentPlayer,\
      \ context);\n\nswitch (dpsScore)\n{\n    case score when score >= 0.9f:\n  \
      \      // Excellent positioning\n        break;\n    case score when score >=\
      \ 0.7f:\n        // Good positioning\n        break;\n    default:\n       \
      \ // Poor positioning - suggest movement\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with AI pathfinding or combat decision-making
    systems. The accuracy of the score heavily depends on the completeness and correctness
    of the CombatPositionContext data passed to it. Ensure that all relevant combat
    parameters are properly initialized before calling this function.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized Player pointer (dps) may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, if the context does not contain valid positional or
    environmental data, the resulting DPS score may be meaningless or misleading.
