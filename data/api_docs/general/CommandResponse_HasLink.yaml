  method: HasLink
  signature: bool CommandResponse::HasLink() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the command response contains a hyperlink reference.
  description: The HasLink method determines if the CommandResponse object currently
    holds a hyperlink (link) that can be used for constructing clickable references
    in game chat or interface elements. This is commonly used when processing command
    outputs that may include references to items, players, or other game objects.
    The method returns true if a link has been set, and false otherwise. It's important
    to note that the presence of a link does not guarantee its validity or usability;
    it simply indicates that a link was added to the response.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the CommandResponse contains a hyperlink reference, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for link presence
    code: "CommandResponse response;\n// ... populate response with data ...\nif (response.HasLink())\
      \ {\n    // Process the link\n    std::cout << \"Response contains a link\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No link present in response\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other CommandResponse methods
    like SetLink() or GetLink() to manage hyperlink references within command responses.
    The implementation likely checks an internal flag or member variable that tracks
    whether a link has been assigned.
