documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Condition object with default values.
  description: The Condition constructor initializes a Condition object, setting up
    its internal state with default values. This method is typically used to create
    condition instances that can be used in various game systems such as quest requirements,
    spell effects, or NPC dialogue triggers. The constructor ensures that all member
    variables are properly initialized to their default states, preventing undefined
    behavior when the condition is later evaluated. In the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture, this constructor is part of the condition system that allows for
    complex logical evaluations within the game's scripting and quest systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Condition Initialization
    code: 'Condition myCondition;

      // Creates a new Condition object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Condition in Quest System
    code: "Condition questCondition;\nquestCondition = Condition();\n// Used to initialize\
      \ a condition for quest requirement checking\nif (questCondition.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Condition class likely contains member variables that track condition
    type, target, and parameters. This constructor should be called before any other
    methods are invoked on the Condition object to ensure proper initialization. The
    default state of a Condition object may represent a 'no condition' state or a
    neutral evaluation state.
  warnings: This is a constructor method, so it should not be called directly on existing
    objects. Calling this method on an already initialized Condition object will result
    in undefined behavior and potential memory leaks if the object's resources are
    not properly cleaned up first.
