  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetTimeout
  signature: uint32 PathfindingManager::GetTimeout() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timeout value used for pathfinding operations within the PathfindingManager.
  description: The GetTimeout method returns the current timeout setting in milliseconds
    that is used by the PathfindingManager to determine how long it will wait for
    a path calculation to complete before timing out. This value is crucial for maintaining
    performance and preventing the game from hanging during complex pathfinding scenarios,
    especially in high-traffic areas or when dealing with large maps. The timeout
    ensures that pathfinding requests do not block other game systems indefinitely.
    This method is typically used internally by the pathfinding system but can also
    be queried by external systems to understand the current behavior of pathfinding
    timeouts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the timeout duration in milliseconds. If the
    returned value is 0, it usually indicates that no timeout is enforced or that
    the default timeout value is being used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Timeout Value
    code: 'uint32 timeout = sPathfinder->GetTimeout();

      TC_LOG_INFO("pathfinding", "Current pathfinding timeout: {} ms", timeout);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    value may vary depending on server configuration or runtime settings, though typically
    it's a fixed value set during initialization.
