  signature: uint32 BattlePetManager::GetXPRequiredForLevel(uint32 currentLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the amount of experience points required to advance a battle pet
    from its current level to the next level.
  description: The GetXPRequiredForLevel method computes the total experience points
    needed for a battle pet to level up from its current level. This value is used
    internally by the BattlePet system to determine when a pet has accumulated enough
    experience to reach the next level. The method takes into account the pet's current
    level and applies a progression curve that increases the required XP exponentially
    as the pet levels up. This ensures that higher-level pets require significantly
    more experience than lower-level ones, maintaining game balance and encouraging
    continued engagement with pet training.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total experience points required
    to advance the battle pet from its current level to the next level. The returned
    value is always positive and typically increases with each level progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 xpRequired = battlePetManager->GetXPRequiredForLevel(5);

      // Returns the XP needed to level up from level 5 to level 6'
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterative Level Progression Example
    code: "for (uint32 level = 1; level <= 25; ++level)\n{\n    uint32 xpRequired\
      \ = battlePetManager->GetXPRequiredForLevel(level);\n    printf(\"Level %u requires\
      \ %u XP\\n\", level, xpRequired);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with BattlePet::AddExperience()
    to determine when a pet should level up. The XP requirement calculation likely
    follows a predefined mathematical progression (e.g., exponential or polynomial)
    that is consistent across all battle pets within the game's balance parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the currentLevel parameter passed to this method is valid
    and within expected bounds (typically 1-25 for standard battle pet levels). Passing
    an invalid level may result in incorrect XP calculations or unexpected behavior
    in the pet leveling system.
