  method: HasFlag
  signature: bool VehicleSeatEntry::HasFlag(VehicleSeatFlagsB flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific vehicle seat flag is set within the VehicleSeatEntry.
  description: The HasFlag method determines whether a particular VehicleSeatFlagsB
    flag is enabled for the current vehicle seat entry. This functionality is essential
    for determining the behavior and capabilities of vehicle seats in World of Warcraft,
    such as whether a seat allows mounting, has specific passenger restrictions, or
    supports special interactions. The method performs a bitwise AND operation between
    the internal flags and the provided flag to evaluate if the specified flag is
    present. It is commonly used during vehicle interaction logic to validate seat
    permissions and behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified VehicleSeatFlagsB flag is set in the vehicle
    seat entry; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Passenger Entry Flag
    code: "VehicleSeatEntry* seatEntry = sVehicleSeatStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (seatEntry && seatEntry->HasFlag(VehicleSeatFlagsB::VEHICLE_SEAT_FLAG_CAN_ENTER_OR_EXIT))\
      \ {\n    // Allow player to enter/exit the vehicle\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating Mounting Permissions
    code: "if (vehicleSeatEntry->HasFlag(VehicleSeatFlagsB::VEHICLE_SEAT_FLAG_CAN_MOUNT))\
      \ {\n    // Enable mounting functionality for this seat\n    player->Mount(vehicle->GetEntry());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal flag storage of the VehicleSeatEntry class,
    which is typically populated from the game's database or DBC files. The VehicleSeatFlagsB
    enum values are defined based on the vehicle seat configuration in the game data
    and should not be modified directly without understanding their impact on gameplay
    mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the VehicleSeatEntry object being queried is valid before
    calling this method to avoid potential null pointer dereferences. Additionally,
    be aware that flag combinations may have complex interactions depending on how
    they are defined in the game's data files.
