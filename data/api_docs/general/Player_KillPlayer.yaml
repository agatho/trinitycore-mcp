  brief: Kills the player character by triggering death mechanics and removing all
    active effects.
  description: The KillPlayer method is used to immediately terminate a player character's
    life within the game world. This method triggers the death sequence, which includes
    removing all active effects, clearing the player's combat state, and handling
    the necessary game mechanics for death. It is typically used in scenarios where
    immediate death needs to be enforced, such as in testing or when implementing
    custom game logic that requires a player to die without normal death mechanics.
    The method does not require any parameters and is part of the Player class's core
    functionality.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->KillPlayer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used in controlled scenarios such as testing or
    when implementing custom game logic. It bypasses normal death mechanics and may
    cause issues if used improperly in live gameplay. The method is thread-safe but
    should not be called during active combat or when player is in a state that requires
    normal death handling.
  warnings: Using this method in live gameplay without proper consideration can lead
    to unexpected behavior, including loss of player state, combat issues, and potential
    game-breaking scenarios. It should never be used in normal gameplay unless explicitly
    required by custom scripts or game mechanics.
