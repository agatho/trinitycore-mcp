  brief: Sends an OK response message to the client via the addon channel command
    handler.
  description: The SendOK method is used within the AddonChannelCommandHandler class
    to transmit a successful acknowledgment response back to the client. This method
    is typically invoked when a command has been processed without errors, signaling
    to the player or addon that the operation completed successfully. It leverages
    the underlying addon communication system in TrinityCore to ensure proper message
    delivery and synchronization between server and client.

    code: "class MyAddonCommandHandler : public AddonChannelCommandHandler {\npublic:\n\
      \    void HandleMyCommand() {\n        // Perform some operation\n        if\
      \ (/* operation successful */) {\n            SendOK(); // Send success response\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method should only be called within the context of an active addon command
    handler session. It assumes that the necessary connection and communication channels
    are already established with the client.
