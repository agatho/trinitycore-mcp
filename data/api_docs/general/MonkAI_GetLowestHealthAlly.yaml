  class: MonkAI
  method: GetLowestHealthAlly
  signature: int * MonkAI::GetLowestHealthAlly(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the lowest health ally within the specified range.
  description: The GetLowestHealthAlly method identifies and returns the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the ally with the lowest health percentage within a given range. This
    method is typically used by AI scripts to determine which friendly unit requires
    healing or support. The method searches through all valid allies in the specified
    range, calculates their health percentages, and returns the GUID of the unit with
    the lowest value. If no valid allies are found within range, it may return nullptr
    or a special invalid GUID value depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the lowest health ally
    within range, or nullptr if no suitable ally is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI
    code: "int* target = monkAI->GetLowestHealthAlly(30.0f);\nif (target != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Use the GUID to cast healing spell on the lowest health ally\n \
      \   Unit* ally = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *target);\n    if (ally && ally->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n        // Cast healing ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in Monk AI behavior trees for prioritizing healing
    targets. The range parameter determines how far the AI will search for allies,
    and performance may be impacted by large ranges or many nearby units. The returned
    GUID should be validated before use to ensure the target still exists and is alive.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without validation, as the target
    unit might have died or become invalid between the time of retrieval and usage.
    Also, this method may not account for friendly fire mechanics or certain debuffs
    that could affect target selection priority.
