  brief: Processes and updates group targeting for DPS assignments in a World of Warcraft
    instance.
  description: The HandleDPSTargeting method is responsible for managing the distribution
    and assignment of target units for damage-per-second (DPS) players within a group
    context. This method typically evaluates current group composition, player roles,
    and target availability to ensure optimal DPS allocation during encounters. It
    may update target references, notify group members of new targets, and synchronize
    targeting states across the group. The method is commonly invoked during encounter
    start events or when target changes occur in dynamic group scenarios such as raids
    or dungeons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Start
    code: "void MyEncounter::OnStart()\n{\n    groupCoordination->HandleDPSTargeting();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Change Event
    code: "void GroupCoordination::OnTargetChanged(Unit* newTarget)\n{\n    HandleDPSTargeting();\
      \ // Reassign DPS targets based on new target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group encounter events and assumes
    that the group has been properly initialized with valid members and roles. It
    may perform synchronization operations that could impact performance if invoked
    too frequently without proper throttling.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of appropriate encounter contexts
    can lead to incorrect targeting behavior or synchronization issues within the
    group. Ensure all group members are in a valid state before calling this method.
