  class: AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  method: AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck::AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck(const
    int * obj, const int * funit, float range, const int * spellInfo, bool incOwnRadius,
    bool incTargetRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for any unit targets within a specified range of an object,
    considering spell-specific radius parameters.
  description: The AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes a predicate
    used to determine whether any unit targets exist within a defined range of a given
    object. This class is typically used in AI or spell targeting logic where area-of-effect
    (AoE) spells need to identify valid targets. It takes into account both the caster's
    and target's radius when calculating proximity, which can be toggled via boolean
    flags. The check evaluates units based on their position relative to the provided
    object and the specified range, making it useful for determining spell targeting
    validity in TrinityCore's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the object (e.g., unit or game object) from which the
      range check is performed. Must not be null.
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to a function or functor that determines if a unit meets
      specific criteria for inclusion in the range check. Should return true for valid
      targets.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) within which units are considered valid
      targets. Must be a positive value.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the spell information structure defining the spell properties,
      including radius and targeting rules. Can be null if not required for the check.
  - name: incOwnRadius
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include the caster's radius in
      the range calculation. If true, the distance is measured from the outer edge
      of the caster's bounding box.
  - name: incTargetRadius
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include the target's radius in
      the range calculation. If true, the distance is measured to the outer edge of
      the target's bounding box.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for AoE spell targeting
    code: "AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(&caster, &isValidTarget, 10.0f,\
      \ &spellInfo, true, true);\nif (check.isValid()) {\n    // Process valid targets\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with custom functor for target validation
    code: "struct MyTargetValidator {\n    bool operator()(Unit* unit) const {\n \
      \       return unit->IsAlive() && unit->IsHostileTo(&caster);\n    }\n};\nMyTargetValidator\
      \ validator;\nAnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(&caster, &validator,\
      \ 15.0f, nullptr, false, true);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is commonly used in spell targeting systems and AI decision-making
    logic within TrinityCore. The range calculation accounts for object bounding boxes,
    which may affect accuracy depending on the shape and size of the involved units
    or objects. Performance can be impacted by large numbers of potential targets,
    especially in high-density combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that all pointers passed to this constructor are valid; passing
    null pointers may result in undefined behavior. Be cautious when using incOwnRadius
    and incTargetRadius flags, as they can significantly alter the effective targeting
    area for spells with large or small units.
