documentation:
  brief: Loads circuit breaker configuration settings from the active TrinityCore
    configuration file.
  description: The LoadFromConfig method initializes and populates the CircuitBreakerConfig
    class members with values defined in the TrinityCore configuration file. This
    method is typically invoked during server startup or configuration reload operations
    to ensure that circuit breaker thresholds, timeouts, and other related parameters
    are properly configured before being used by the system. The method reads settings
    such as maximum failure count, timeout duration, and reset intervals from the
    config file and applies them to internal member variables. It does not return
    any value but modifies the object's state based on configuration data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'CircuitBreakerConfig config;

      config.LoadFromConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the configuration system has been
    initialized. It assumes that the TrinityCore configuration file contains valid
    entries for circuit breaker settings. The method performs no validation of configuration
    values, so invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior.
