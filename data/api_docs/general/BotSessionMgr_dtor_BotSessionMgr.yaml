  signature: void BotSessionMgr::~BotSessionMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotSessionMgr instance and cleans up all associated bot sessions
    and resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSessionMgr class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all bot sessions managed by this instance. It ensures that any allocated
    memory, active connections, or session-specific data structures are released to
    prevent memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when a BotSessionMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destruction process typically
    involves iterating through all active bot sessions and calling their respective
    cleanup routines before releasing the manager's internal resources. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this destructor plays a critical role in maintaining
    server stability by ensuring proper resource deallocation when bot systems are
    shut down or reloaded.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSessionMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotSessionMgr* sessionMgr = new BotSessionMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the session manager ...\n    delete sessionMgr; // Destructor\
      \ is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called manually unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. The cleanup process may involve database operations and network connection
    closures, so it's recommended to ensure all bot sessions are properly terminated
    before destruction. The method is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during
    stack unwinding or explicit deletion.
  warnings: Calling this destructor directly on a stack-allocated BotSessionMgr object
    will result in undefined behavior. Always ensure proper ownership semantics when
    managing BotSessionMgr instances, especially in multi-threaded environments where
    concurrent access to bot sessions must be considered.
