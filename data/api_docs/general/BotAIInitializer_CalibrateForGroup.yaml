  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: CalibrateForGroup
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::CalibrateForGroup()
documentation:
  brief: Calibrates bot AI settings for optimal performance within a group context.
  description: The CalibrateForGroup method adjusts various artificial intelligence
    parameters and behaviors of bot characters to ensure they function effectively
    when part of a player group. This calibration process typically involves analyzing
    the group composition, adjusting bot decision-making logic, and fine-tuning their
    combat and movement strategies based on the presence of other players. The method
    is designed to improve coordination between bots and real players, reduce conflicts
    in group activities such as dungeons or raids, and enhance overall group performance
    by optimizing bot behavior dynamically.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Context
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.CalibrateForGroup();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a new group is formed or when significant
    changes occur in group composition to ensure that bot AI adapts properly. It may
    involve internal recalculations of threat levels, role assignments, and behavior
    priorities based on current group dynamics.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or high-intensity group activities
    might cause temporary disruption in bot behavior until calibration is complete.
    Ensure it's used at appropriate transition points such as before entering a dungeon
    or after adding/removing players from the group.
