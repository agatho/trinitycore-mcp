  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: FindTanks
  signature: int LFGBotSelector::FindTanks(uint8 minLevel, uint8 maxLevel, uint32
    count)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of available tank class bots within specified
    level constraints.
  description: The FindTanks method searches for eligible bot characters that are
    assigned to the tank role (typically Death Knight, Warrior, or Paladin) within
    the provided minimum and maximum level range. It filters bots based on their current
    availability and role assignment, returning a count of how many suitable tanks
    were found. This method is commonly used in LFG (Looking For Group) systems to
    populate group formations with appropriate class roles. The method assumes that
    bot characters are already initialized and registered within the system.
  parameters:
  - name: minLevel
    description: Minimum acceptable level for tank bots. Must be a valid player level
      (typically 1-80 in most expansions).
  - name: maxLevel
    description: Maximum acceptable level for tank bots. Must be greater than or equal
      to minLevel.
  - name: count
    description: The number of tanks to find and return. This parameter is likely
      used as an input to determine how many bots should be selected, though the actual
      implementation may vary.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of tank bots found that match
    the specified criteria. A value of 0 indicates no suitable bots were found. Negative
    values may indicate error conditions or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Find tanks between levels 60 and 70
    code: "int tankCount = selector.FindTanks(60, 70, 2); // Attempts to find 2 tanks\
      \ between levels 60 and 70\nif (tankCount >= 2) {\n    // Proceed with group\
      \ formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Find all available tanks at max level
    code: "int tankCount = selector.FindTanks(80, 80, 1); // Find one tank at level\
      \ 80\nif (tankCount > 0) {\n    // Use the found tank for a high-level raid\
      \ group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot management and class assignment logic.
    It may not return all available tanks if they are currently in use or assigned
    to other groups. The actual selection process might involve additional filtering
    based on server load or player availability.
  warnings: Ensure that minLevel is less than or equal to maxLevel; otherwise, the
    method may return unexpected results or errors. Be cautious when using very high
    level ranges as it could impact performance or return invalid data if bots do
    not exist at those levels.
