documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum search radius for an area trigger shape.
  description: The GetMaxSearchRadius method computes the largest possible radius
    within which an area trigger's effects can be detected or applied. This value
    is typically derived from the geometric properties of the area trigger shape,
    such as its dimensions or bounding box. The result is used by the game engine
    to optimize performance by limiting the number of objects that need to be checked
    for interaction with the area trigger. This method is essential for maintaining
    efficient collision detection and spell targeting mechanics in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum search radius in world units (typically
    yards). This value defines the extent to which the area trigger can affect objects
    within its range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AreaTriggerShapeInfo shapeInfo;\nfloat maxRadius = shapeInfo.GetMaxSearchRadius();\n\
      // Use maxRadius for area trigger logic\nif (maxRadius > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with area trigger processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Area Trigger Processing
    code: "void ProcessAreaTrigger(AreaTriggerShapeInfo& shape, Position const& center)\n\
      {\n    float maxRadius = shape.GetMaxSearchRadius();\n    // Search for nearby\
      \ players within the maximum radius\n    std::vector<Player*> players;\n   \
      \ Trinity::PlayerListSearcher<Trinity::AllianceCheck> searcher(center, players,\
      \ maxRadius);\n    // Apply area trigger effects to found players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed once during initialization of the
    area trigger shape rather than recalculated on every use for performance reasons.
    The returned value should be treated as read-only and not modified directly.
  warnings: Do not assume that all area triggers will have a non-zero radius. Some
    special shapes or edge cases might return zero or negative values, which could
    indicate invalid configuration or special handling requirements.
