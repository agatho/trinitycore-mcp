  method: RemoveFlag
  signature: void GameObject::RemoveFlag(int flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified flag from the GameObject's flags.
  description: This method removes a specific flag from the GameObject's internal
    flag set, allowing for precise control over the object's behavior and state. The
    flag removal process is typically used to modify game mechanics such as interaction
    states or visual properties of the GameObject. It operates on the GameObject's
    current flag set, ensuring that the specified flag is no longer present in the
    object's configuration. This method is commonly used when modifying GameObject
    states during quest events or when adjusting the visibility of certain game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The flag or flags to be removed from the GameObject. This parameter
      represents a bitmask value that corresponds to specific flags defined in the
      GameObject's flag system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a single flag
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->RemoveFlag(GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_INTERACT;)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing multiple flags
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->RemoveFlag(GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_LOCK | GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_TRANSPORT);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the GameObject's internal flag system, which is typically
    managed through bit manipulation. The implementation ensures that flags are properly
    removed from the object's state without affecting other unrelated flags. Performance
    considerations include minimal overhead when removing flags, as the operation
    is handled internally within the GameObject class.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect game behavior or visual
    artifacts. Care should be taken when removing flags, especially if they are part
    of a larger set of flags that control interaction or visibility. Removing flags
    incorrectly may prevent proper interaction with the GameObject during quest events.
