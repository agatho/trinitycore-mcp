  method: PredictPriceMovement
  signature: float AuctionHouse::PredictPriceMovement(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the price movement trend for a specified item in the auction house.
  description: The PredictPriceMovement method estimates the directional trend of
    an item's price within the auction house system. It analyzes various factors such
    as supply, demand, historical pricing data, and market behavior to determine whether
    the price is likely to increase, decrease, or remain stable. This prediction is
    typically used by the game's UI or AI systems to provide players with insights
    about market dynamics. The method does not directly modify auction house data
    but rather returns a float value representing the predicted movement direction
    and magnitude.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value indicating the predicted price movement trend. Positive values
    suggest an upward price trend, negative values indicate a downward trend, and
    values near zero imply stable pricing. The exact scale and interpretation may
    depend on internal game mechanics and data normalization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float movement = auctionHouse->PredictPriceMovement(18732);\nif (movement\
      \ > 0.0f) {\n    printf(\"Price is expected to rise.\\n\");\n} else if (movement\
      \ < 0.0f) {\n    printf(\"Price is expected to fall.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Price is expected to remain stable.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal algorithms that consider item rarity, auction
    duration, recent bidding activity, and player behavior patterns. It may not be
    thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
  warnings: This method is speculative and based on predictive models; actual price
    movements in the auction house can vary due to unpredictable player actions or
    system events. Do not rely solely on this prediction for critical game logic decisions.
