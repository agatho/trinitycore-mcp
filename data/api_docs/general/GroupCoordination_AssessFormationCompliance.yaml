  method: AssessFormationCompliance
  signature: float GroupCoordination::AssessFormationCompliance()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the compliance level of group members' positioning
    relative to the designated formation.
  description: The AssessFormationCompliance method calculates a float value representing
    how well the current group members are maintaining their assigned formation. This
    value typically ranges from 0.0 (completely non-compliant) to 1.0 (perfectly compliant),
    with intermediate values indicating partial compliance. The method considers factors
    such as distance between members, orientation relative to the group leader, and
    adherence to predefined formation offsets. It is commonly used in group-based
    gameplay mechanics such as raid coordination, battlefield positioning, or quest-specific
    formations where maintaining proper spacing and alignment is crucial for success.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the level of formation compliance.
    A value of 1.0 represents perfect compliance, while 0.0 indicates complete non-compliance.
    Values in between represent partial compliance levels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float compliance = group->AssessFormationCompliance();\nif (compliance\
      \ < 0.8f)\n{\n    // Notify players of poor formation compliance\n    group->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Your formation is not properly aligned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "GroupCoordination* coordination = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      float compliance = coordination->AssessFormationCompliance();\nif (compliance\
      \ > 0.95f)\n{\n    // Award bonus for perfect formation\n    player->AddAchievementCriteria(ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_FORMATION_PERFECT);\n\
      }\nelse if (compliance < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Apply penalty for poor formation\n\
      \    player->ModifySpellPower(-10);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive during large group scenarios,
    as it evaluates each member's position against the formation requirements. It
    should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The compliance
    calculation might vary based on group type (raid vs. party) and formation rules
    defined by the specific game context.
  warnings: This method assumes that all group members are valid and have proper positioning
    data. Calling it on a null or invalid group may lead to undefined behavior. Additionally,
    the returned value is dynamic and changes with each call as positions of group
    members change.
