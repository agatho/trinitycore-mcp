  class: ShamanAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the shaman has sufficient resource requirements to cast a specified
    spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the current shaman AI
    character possesses the necessary resources, such as mana, runes, or other spell-specific
    requirements, to successfully cast the given spell. This method is typically used
    during AI decision-making processes to determine spell eligibility before attempting
    to cast. It considers the spell's resource cost and the shaman's current resource
    state, including any temporary buffs or debuffs that may affect resource availability.
    The method does not modify the character's state but rather performs a read-only
    check to support intelligent spell selection logic.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to evaluate for resource sufficiency.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database, typically defined
      within the Spell.dbc or related spell definitions.
  returns: Returns true if the shaman has sufficient resources to cast the specified
    spell; otherwise returns false. The method accounts for all relevant resource
    types including mana, rage, energy, and any special resources required by the
    spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (shamanAI->HasEnoughResource(8042)) {\n    // Cast Earth Shock if enough\
      \ resources\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(8042);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ action\n    shamanAI->SelectNextAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check Before Complex Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 fireNovaSpell = 1535, earthShockSpell = 8042;\nif (shamanAI->HasEnoughResource(fireNovaSpell))\
      \ {\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(fireNovaSpell);\n} else if (shamanAI->HasEnoughResource(earthShockSpell))\
      \ {\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(earthShockSpell);\n} else {\n    shamanAI->DoNothing();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal resource tracking within the ShamanAI class
    and assumes that all necessary resource updates have been performed prior to calling.
    It may not account for dynamic changes in resource availability during execution,
    such as those caused by ongoing effects or interrupts.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell entry; invalid IDs may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect evaluations. The method does not validate
    the spell's castability beyond resource requirements, so additional checks should
    be performed for full spell eligibility.
