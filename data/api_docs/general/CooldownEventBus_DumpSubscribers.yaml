  brief: Dumps all registered cooldown event subscribers to the console or log system
  description: The DumpSubscribers method outputs a list of all currently registered
    subscribers to the CooldownEventBus. This utility function is primarily used for
    debugging and development purposes to inspect which systems or components are
    listening for cooldown-related events. The method iterates through the internal
    subscriber registry and logs each subscriber's identifier or callback information.
    It does not modify any state and serves purely as a diagnostic tool. This functionality
    is typically disabled in production builds but may be enabled during development
    or debugging sessions.

  notes: This method is intended for debugging only and should not be called in performance-critical
    code paths. The output format may vary depending on the logging backend used by
    TrinityCore. In release builds, this function might be compiled out entirely.
