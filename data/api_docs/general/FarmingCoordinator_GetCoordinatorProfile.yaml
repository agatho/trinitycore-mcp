  signature: FarmingCoordinatorProfile FarmingCoordinator::GetCoordinatorProfile(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the farming coordinator profile associated with a specified player
    GUID.
  description: The GetCoordinatorProfile method fetches the FarmingCoordinatorProfile
    object that corresponds to the given player's unique identifier (GUID). This method
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to access or modify player-specific farming data, such as crop types, growth status,
    or resource allocation. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure
    or database table indexed by player GUID and returns a copy of the associated
    profile. It does not modify any persistent state but may involve reading from
    memory or cached data structures depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: A unique identifier for the player whose farming coordinator profile
      is to be retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      world and typically matches the GUID used internally by TrinityCore for entity
      identification.
  returns: Returns a FarmingCoordinatorProfile object containing all relevant data
    associated with the specified player's farming activities. If no profile exists
    for the given player GUID, the method may return an empty or default-initialized
    profile, or potentially throw an exception depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "FarmingCoordinatorProfile profile = coordinator.GetCoordinatorProfile(12345);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process the farming data\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Crops planted: \" << profile.GetPlantedCrops() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "try {\n    FarmingCoordinatorProfile profile = coordinator.GetCoordinatorProfile(playerGuid);\n\
      \    if (profile.IsValid()) {\n        // Use the valid profile\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Handle invalid or missing profile\n        LOG_ERROR(\"farming\"\
      , \"No farming profile found for player {}\", playerGuid);\n    }\n} catch (const\
      \ std::exception& e) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"farming\", \"Failed to retrieve profile\
      \ for player {}: {}\", playerGuid, e.what());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a map or similar data structure keyed
    by player GUID for efficient lookup. Performance depends on the underlying storage
    mechanism; ideally, it should be O(1) or near-constant time. The returned profile
    object may be a copy and changes to it will not affect the original unless explicitly
    saved back.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player in the game world. Using an invalid GUID might lead to undefined behavior,
    incorrect data retrieval, or exceptions depending on how the internal lookup is
    implemented.
