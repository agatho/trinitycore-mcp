  class: BattlePetManager
  method: ExecuteBattleTurn
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::ExecuteBattleTurn(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a single turn in a battle pet combat encounter and returns true
    if the turn was successfully processed.
  description: The ExecuteBattleTurn method processes one complete turn within a Battle
    Pet battle, handling all actions taken by both players during that turn. It manages
    the sequence of events including pet attacks, ability usage, status effect updates,
    and damage calculations. This method is typically called as part of the battle
    loop to advance combat forward. The method may modify internal battle state variables
    and can potentially end the battle if one side is defeated. It returns true when
    the turn completes successfully without errors, and false if the turn cannot be
    executed due to invalid conditions or battle termination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battle turn was successfully executed and all actions
    processed correctly; returns false if the turn could not be completed due to battle
    state issues, invalid player data, or combat ending prematurely.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Battle Turn Execution
    code: "BattlePetManager* petManager = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetManager();\n\
      int player = 0;\nbool success = petManager->ExecuteBattleTurn(&player);\nif\
      \ (success)\n{\n    // Turn processed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Battle\
      \ turn executed successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Turn failed to execute\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to execute battle turn.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core Battle Pet combat system and should only
    be called during active battle encounters. The player parameter may be modified
    internally to reflect current active player in the turn sequence. This method
    does not directly handle UI updates or packet sending - those are handled separately
    by the battle system.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active battle context may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that a valid battle session is active before invoking
    this method. The method assumes proper initialization of all battle state variables
    and may fail silently if these conditions aren't met.
