  brief: Enables proficiency for a spell, allowing the player to use weapons with

  description: The EffectProficiency method is responsible for granting proficiency
    to a spell, which allows the player to use weapons with specific weapon skills.
    This method typically handles the logic for determining whether a player can use
    a particular weapon type based on their proficiency in that weapon category. It
    may also handle the removal of any existing proficiency effects or the application
    of new ones depending on the context. The method is part of the spell's effect
    handling system and is commonly used when a spell requires weapon proficiency
    to function correctly.
