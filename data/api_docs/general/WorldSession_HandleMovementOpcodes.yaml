  brief: Processes client-side movement packets received from players
  description: The HandleMovementOpcodes method is responsible for handling all incoming
    player movement-related packets sent by clients in World of Warcraft. This method
    processes various movement commands including player position updates, orientation
    changes, and movement state information. It serves as a central handler for movement
    data that originates from the client's input and translates it into appropriate
    server-side actions. The method typically validates movement data, applies necessary
    corrections or adjustments, and ensures synchronization between client and server
    states. This is a critical component of the game's networking system that maintains
    accurate player positioning and movement mechanics across the world.

  - title: Basic Movement Packet Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMovementOpcodes(WorldPackets::Movement::ClientPlayerMovement&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process movement data from client\n    Player* player =\
      \ GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    // Update player\
      \ position based on packet data\n    player->UpdatePosition(packet.GetPosition(),\
      \ packet.GetOrientation());\n    \n    // Handle movement state changes\n  \
      \  player->SetMovementFlags(packet.GetMovementFlags());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main packet processing loop and should not
    block for extended periods. It's important to validate all incoming movement data
    to prevent exploits such as teleportation hacks or speed cheating. The method
    may trigger additional server-side validations including collision detection,
    terrain checks, and zone transitions.
  warnings: Improper handling of movement packets can lead to desynchronization between
    client and server, causing players to appear in incorrect locations or experience
    movement glitches. This method should never be called directly from outside the
    packet processing context as it assumes proper session state and packet validation
    has already occurred.
