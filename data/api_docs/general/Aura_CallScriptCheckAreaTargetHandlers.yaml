documentation:
  brief: Calls all registered script handlers to check if a target is valid for area
    aura application
  description: The CallScriptCheckAreaTargetHandlers method iterates through all registered
    script handlers associated with the aura and invokes their target validation logic.
    This method determines whether a specific unit can be affected by the area aura
    based on custom script conditions defined in the TrinityCore scripting system.
    It is typically called during aura application or reapplication to ensure that
    targets still meet the criteria for being affected by the aura. The method returns
    true if all handlers approve the target, or false if any handler rejects it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all script handlers approve the target for area aura application;
    returns false if any handler rejects the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application logic
    code: "if (aura->CallScriptCheckAreaTargetHandlers(targetUnit)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ aura to target\n    targetUnit->AddAura(aura, caster);\n} else {\n    // Target\
      \ not valid for aura\n    SendSpellFailed(client, SPELL_FAILED_BAD_TARGETS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura's scripting interface and relies on custom
    scripts being properly registered. The method may be called multiple times during
    an aura's lifetime, particularly when targets are added or removed from the aura's
    area of effect.
  warnings: Ensure that all script handlers properly validate their inputs to avoid
    crashes or undefined behavior. This method should not be called with null target
    pointers as it will likely cause a crash or assertion failure.
