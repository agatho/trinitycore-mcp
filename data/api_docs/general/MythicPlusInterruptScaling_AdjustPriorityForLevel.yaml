  class: MythicPlusInterruptScaling
  method: AdjustPriorityForLevel
  signature: InterruptPriority MythicPlusInterruptScaling::AdjustPriorityForLevel(InterruptPriority
    base, uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the interrupt priority based on the player's level for mythic plus
    dungeons.
  description: The AdjustPriorityForLevel method modifies an interrupt priority value
    according to the player's current level within the context of Mythic+ dungeon
    operations. This scaling ensures that interrupts are appropriately prioritized
    depending on the player's progression and difficulty level. The method is typically
    used during dungeon generation or encounter handling to dynamically adjust the
    behavior of interrupt mechanics based on player capabilities. It takes into account
    the base interrupt priority and scales it according to the provided level, which
    can influence how interrupts are processed or ranked in the game's system.
  parameters:
  - name: base
    description: The initial interrupt priority value to be adjusted. This represents
      the baseline priority before scaling based on player level.
  - name: level
    description: The player's current level used to scale the interrupt priority.
      Valid values are typically between 1 and 80, though specific constraints may
      apply depending on game mechanics.
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority value that has been adjusted according to
    the specified player level. The returned value reflects a modified priority level
    that accounts for the player's progression within the Mythic+ system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AdjustPriorityForLevel
    code: 'InterruptPriority basePriority = InterruptPriority::HIGH;

      uint8 playerLevel = 60;

      InterruptPriority adjustedPriority = MythicPlusInterruptScaling::AdjustPriorityForLevel(basePriority,
      playerLevel);

      // The adjusted priority will be scaled based on level 60'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal scaling factors or lookup tables to determine
    how the base priority should be modified according to the player's level. It is
    part of a larger system that manages interrupt behavior in Mythic+ dungeons, where
    higher-level players may have different interrupt handling rules than lower-level
    players.
  warnings: Ensure that the input level parameter is within valid game bounds to prevent
    unexpected behavior or out-of-range errors during priority adjustments. Incorrect
    handling of the base priority value could lead to improper interrupt logic in
    dungeon encounters.
