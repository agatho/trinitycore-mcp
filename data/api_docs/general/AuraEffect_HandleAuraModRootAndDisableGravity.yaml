  method: HandleAuraModRootAndDisableGravity
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModRootAndDisableGravity(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the root and disable gravity aura effect on a target.
  description: The HandleAuraModRootAndDisableGravity method manages the application
    and removal of an aura that simultaneously roots the target in place and disables
    gravity, effectively making the target float or remain stationary. This is commonly
    used for spells like 'Root' or 'Levitate' effects in World of Warcraft. The method
    interacts with the AuraApplication object to determine how the effect should be
    applied or removed based on the mode and apply flags. It modifies the target's
    movement state and physics properties, ensuring that the character cannot move
    or fall while under this effect.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's context and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of the aura application, typically indicating whether it
      is being applied, removed, or updated. Values may include AURA_EFFECT_HANDLE_REAL,
      AURA_EFFECT_HANDLE_UPDATE, etc.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the target is rooted and gravity is disabled; when
      false, the effects are reversed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Root and Disable Gravity Aura
    code: "void ApplyRootAura(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (Aura* aura = target->GetAura(12345))\
      \ // Example aura ID\n    {\n        aura->ApplyEffect(this, 0, true);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Root and Disable Gravity Aura
    code: "void RemoveRootAura(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (Aura* aura = target->GetAura(12345))\n\
      \    {\n        aura->RemoveEffect(this, 0, false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the movement flags and physics state of
    the affected unit. It should only be called from within the aura application system.
    The effect is typically used for temporary immobilization or levitation mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected behavior in character
    movement or physics. Ensure that the aura application context is valid before
    calling, and always pair apply with remove calls to prevent state inconsistencies.
