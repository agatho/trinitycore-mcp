documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CliCommandHolder instance and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CliCommandHolder class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were associated with the
    command holder object. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    CLI system, this destructor plays a critical role in managing command objects
    that are used to handle console commands issued by administrators or developers.
    It typically handles cleanup of internal data structures such as command names,
    descriptions, and callback functions without requiring explicit user intervention.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CliCommandHolder
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    CliCommandHolder holder;\n    // ... use\
      \ the holder ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when holder goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when a CliCommandHolder
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process typically
    involves freeing any heap-allocated memory used internally by the command holder.
