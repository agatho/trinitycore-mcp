  brief: Resurrects the player's pet and restores its health and mana.
  description: The EffectResurrectPet method handles the resurrection of a player's
    pet, typically triggered by spells like 'Resurrection' or 'Ancestral Spirit'.
    It restores the pet's health and mana to their maximum values, ensuring the pet
    can continue fighting alongside the player. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other resurrection mechanics and is part of the broader spell effect handling
    system within TrinityCore.

    code: "void Spell::EffectResurrectPet()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n  \
      \  // This method is called during spell effects processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the pet is in a state where resurrection
    is possible, such as when it has been killed or is in a dead state. It typically
    requires the presence of a valid pet and its owner to function correctly.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to pets not being properly resurrected,
    resulting in lost combat effectiveness or game mechanics issues. Ensure that the
    pet's state is checked before calling this method.
