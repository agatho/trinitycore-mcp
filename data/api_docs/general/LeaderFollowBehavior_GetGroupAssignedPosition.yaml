  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetGroupAssignedPosition
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::GetGroupAssignedPosition(Player * bot, Group
    * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the positional index of a bot within a group for leader-follow
    behavior mechanics.
  description: The GetGroupAssignedPosition method calculates and returns the assigned
    position of a specified bot player within a given group, which is used to determine
    the bot's role in leader-follow behavior patterns. This method is typically invoked
    during group formation or reorganization to assign specific positions (such as
    front, middle, or rear) to players based on their role or priority. The returned
    integer represents an index that corresponds to a specific position within the
    group's formation structure, allowing for dynamic positioning adjustments as group
    members change or are added/removed. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    organized group movement and ensuring proper execution of leader-follow AI behaviors
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose group position
      is being determined. Must be a valid player instance that is currently part
      of a group.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the bot player. This parameter
      defines the context in which the bot's position is calculated and must represent
      an active group with valid members.
  returns: An integer value representing the assigned position index of the bot within
    the group. The value typically ranges from 0 to (group_size - 1), where 0 represents
    the first position in the formation, and higher values indicate later positions.
    Returns -1 if the bot is not found in the group or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid player\nGroup* group = bot->GetGroup();\n\
      if (group)\n{\n    int position = leaderFollowBehavior->GetGroupAssignedPosition(bot,\
      \ group);\n    if (position >= 0)\n    {\n        // Bot has a valid assigned\
      \ position in the group\n        sLog->outString(\"Bot is at position %d in\
      \ the group.\", position);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to determine bot's group position.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Position-Based Logic
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nGroup* group = bot->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(bot))\n\
      {\n    int position = leaderFollowBehavior->GetGroupAssignedPosition(bot, group);\n\
      \    switch (position)\n    {\n        case 0:\n            // Bot is in the\
      \ lead position\n            break;\n        case 1:\n        case 2:\n    \
      \        // Bot is in a supporting position\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Bot is at the rear or invalid position\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been properly initialized
    and that the bot player is a valid member of that group. The implementation may
    internally use group formation logic to assign positions based on factors such
    as player roles, class types, or other AI-defined criteria. It's important to
    note that position assignments can change dynamically during gameplay when group
    members are added or removed.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and group parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null values may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Additionally, this method should only be called when the bot is actually
    part of a group; otherwise, it will return -1 without performing any meaningful
    calculations.
