  class: GroupCoordination
  method: InitiateCombat
  signature: void GroupCoordination::InitiateCombat(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat with the specified target unit for the group coordination.
  description: The InitiateCombat method triggers combat engagement between the group
    coordination's active units and a given target unit. This method is typically
    used in AI-driven group behaviors where coordinated actions are required against
    a specific enemy. It ensures that all relevant group members begin attacking the
    target, applying appropriate combat mechanics such as threat generation, aggro
    handling, and combat state transitions. The method does not validate if the target
    is already in combat or if it's a valid combatant; this responsibility lies with
    the calling code.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the group coordination will initiate
      combat against. Must be a valid pointer to an existing unit in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Initiation
    code: 'GroupCoordination* gc = ...;

      Unit* enemy = ...;

      gc->InitiateCombat(enemy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combat Initiation
    code: "if (enemy && enemy->IsAlive()) {\n    GroupCoordination* gc = GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      \    gc->InitiateCombat(enemy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group coordination has already been initialized
    and contains valid units capable of engaging in combat. It does not perform any
    checks on whether the target is a valid combatant or if the group members are
    in a state to fight.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be
    cautious about initiating combat with units that are already engaged in combat
    to prevent unexpected behavior.
