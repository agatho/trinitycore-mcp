documentation:
  brief: Resets the current trade session between two players, clearing all trade
    state and items.
  description: The ResetTradeSession method terminates an ongoing trade interaction
    between two players by clearing all associated trade data, including traded items,
    accepted states, and any pending trade confirmations. This method is typically
    invoked when a player cancels a trade, logs out, or when a trade fails to complete
    successfully. It ensures that both parties' trade windows are properly closed
    and their inventory states are restored to reflect the pre-trade condition. The
    method does not validate whether a trade session actually exists before resetting
    it, so calling it without an active trade may have no effect but should not cause
    errors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Session Reset
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetTradeManager();

      tradeMgr->ResetTradeSession();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage trade state transitions. It should not be called directly from game logic
    unless explicitly required for custom trade handling or debugging purposes.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid trade context may leave the trade
    manager in an inconsistent state if not properly managed. Ensure that all related
    trade operations are completed before invoking this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
