documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bounds of exclusive quest groups associated with a specified
    exclusive group ID.
  description: The GetExclusiveQuestGroupBounds method retrieves the start and end
    indices of exclusive quest groups within the internal quest management system.
    This method is used to determine the range of quests that belong to a specific
    exclusive group, which is essential for handling quest exclusivity mechanics in
    World of Warcraft. Exclusive quest groups are used to ensure that players can
    only complete one quest from a set of mutually exclusive quests. The returned
    bounds define the valid range of quest IDs within this group. This method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameter and assumes the exclusive group
    ID is valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ExclusiveQuestGroupsBounds object containing the start and end indices
    defining the range of quests in the specified exclusive group. The bounds are
    inclusive, meaning both start and end indices represent valid quest IDs within
    the group.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bounds for exclusive quest group
    code: "ExclusiveQuestGroupsBounds bounds = sObjectMgr->GetExclusiveQuestGroupBounds(12345);\n\
      if (bounds.first != bounds.second)\n{\n    printf(\"Exclusive group has quests\
      \ from %d to %d\\n\", bounds.first, bounds.second);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      No quests found in exclusive group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal quest data structures and should be used carefully.
    The returned bounds are not validated against actual quest existence, so calling
    code must ensure the exclusive group ID is valid. This method is typically used
    during quest loading or processing to determine which quests belong to a specific
    exclusive group.
  warnings: This method assumes that the exclusive group ID provided is valid and
    exists in the internal data structures. Using an invalid exclusive group ID may
    result in incorrect bounds or undefined behavior. The returned bounds are indices
    into the internal quest array, not actual quest IDs.
