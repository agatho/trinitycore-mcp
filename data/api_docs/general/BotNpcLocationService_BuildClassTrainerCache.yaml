  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: BuildClassTrainerCache
  signature: void BotNpcLocationService::BuildClassTrainerCache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with class trainer locations and associated
    data for bot AI navigation.
  description: The BuildClassTrainerCache method initializes or updates an internal
    data structure that stores information about class trainers within the game world.
    This cache is used by bot AI systems to locate and navigate to appropriate trainers
    for specific character classes. The method typically iterates through all available
    trainer NPCs, identifies those offering class-specific training services, and
    caches their locations, required levels, and other relevant attributes. It ensures
    that bots can efficiently find trainers without repeatedly querying the database
    or world state during runtime operations.

    code: 'BotNpcLocationService* service = BotNpcLocationService::instance();

      service->BuildClassTrainerCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during server initialization or when trainer
    data is expected to change. The cache is typically rebuilt periodically to reflect
    updates in the game world such as new trainers or modified training requirements.
