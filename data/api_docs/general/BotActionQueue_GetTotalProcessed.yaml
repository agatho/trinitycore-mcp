  method: GetTotalProcessed
  signature: uint64 BotActionQueue::GetTotalProcessed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of processed bot actions since the queue was initialized.
  description: The GetTotalProcessed method retrieves a cumulative count of all bot
    actions that have been successfully executed or processed by the BotActionQueue.
    This value represents the total number of actions handled by the queue, including
    those that may have been completed, skipped, or failed but were still accounted
    for in the processing tally. The method is typically used to monitor the activity
    level of a bot's action queue and can be helpful for debugging, performance tracking,
    or statistical reporting purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of processed actions. This
    counter increases monotonically as actions are processed by the queue and does
    not reset unless the queue itself is reset or reinitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Activity
    code: 'uint64 totalProcessed = botActionQueue->GetTotalProcessed();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Bot has processed {} actions so far.", totalProcessed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Action Processing Over Time
    code: 'uint64 initialCount = botActionQueue->GetTotalProcessed();

      // ... perform some bot actions ...

      uint64 finalCount = botActionQueue->GetTotalProcessed();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Bot processed {} actions during this interval.", finalCount
      - initialCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread that has access
    to the BotActionQueue instance. The returned value reflects all actions processed
    up to the point of the call, including those that may have resulted in errors
    or were skipped due to conditions such as cooldowns or invalid targets.
  warnings: The counter returned by this method includes all actions that were attempted,
    not just successful ones. If an action fails or is skipped due to game logic constraints
    (e.g., target out of range), it will still increment the total processed count
    if it was considered part of the processing pipeline.
