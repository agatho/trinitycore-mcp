documentation:
  brief: Loads faction vendor requirements for the vendor interaction system
  description: This method initializes and loads all faction-based vendor requirements
    from the database into memory. It processes faction-specific conditions that determine
    which items can be sold by vendors based on the player's faction standing. The
    method is typically called during server startup or when reloading vendor data
    to ensure that faction requirements are properly configured for all vendor interactions.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper vendor behavior in World
    of Warcraft's faction-based economy system.

    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.LoadFactionVendorRequirements();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and faction data is available. The method performs database queries to fetch faction
    vendor requirements, so performance may be impacted during server startup when
    loading large amounts of vendor data.
