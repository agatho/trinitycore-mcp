documentation:
  brief: Analyzes learning trends of bot performance over time to identify patterns
    and improvements.
  description: The AnalyzeLearningTrends method evaluates historical data on bot behavior
    and performance metrics to detect trends in learning progression. It processes
    accumulated statistics from bot interactions, skill acquisition, and decision-making
    patterns to determine how effectively bots are adapting and improving their gameplay
    strategies. This method is typically invoked during periodic performance reviews
    or when generating analytics reports for bot development teams. The analysis may
    include identifying bottlenecks in learning curves, detecting anomalies in performance
    spikes, and correlating behavioral changes with specific training interventions.
