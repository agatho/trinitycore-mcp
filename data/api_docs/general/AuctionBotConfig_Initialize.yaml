  class: AuctionBotConfig
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool AuctionBotConfig::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AuctionBot configuration system and loads all auction bot
    settings from the database.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the AuctionBot configuration by loading
    all relevant settings from the database into memory. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when the auction bot system needs to be reinitialized.
    It ensures that all configuration parameters, such as bid strategies, item categories,
    and pricing rules, are properly loaded and validated before the auction bot begins
    operating. The method performs necessary checks to verify that required configuration
    entries exist and are valid, returning false if initialization fails due to missing
    or corrupted data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the configuration was successfully initialized and all
    settings were loaded correctly; returns false if initialization failed due to
    database errors, missing configuration entries, or invalid data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "AuctionBotConfig config;\nbool success = config.Initialize();\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Auction bot configuration loaded successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auction Bot configuration initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize Auction\
      \ Bot configuration.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's lifecycle, typically
    during startup. Reinitialization may cause conflicts with existing auction bot
    operations. The method performs database queries and may have performance implications
    during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent configuration states. Ensure that no auction bot
    operations are running when calling this method.
