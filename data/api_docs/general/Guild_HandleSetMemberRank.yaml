  class: Guild
  method: HandleSetMemberRank
  signature: void Guild::HandleSetMemberRank(WorldSession * session, int guid, int
    setterGuid, GuildRankOrder rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rank of a guild member, updating their permissions and privileges
    within the guild.
  description: The HandleSetMemberRank method is responsible for changing the rank
    of a specified guild member. This operation modifies the member's guild rank order,
    which affects their permissions and abilities within the guild. The method requires
    both the target member's GUID and the GUID of the player performing the action
    (the setter) to ensure proper authorization. It is typically invoked when a guild
    leader or officer promotes or demotes a guild member. This method does not directly
    send messages to players but rather updates internal guild data structures and
    may trigger subsequent network updates to reflect the rank change.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player performing the rank change
      operation. Used for authentication and context.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the guild member whose rank
      is being changed. Must correspond to an existing guild member.
  - name: setterGuid
    description: The GUID of the player performing the rank change. Must have sufficient
      guild permissions to modify ranks.
  - name: rank
    description: The new GuildRankOrder value to assign to the target member. Valid
      values depend on the guild's configured rank structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Promote a Guild Member
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->HandleSetMemberRank(session,\
      \ targetPlayerGuid, setterGuid, GR_OFFICER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the session and GUIDs are valid and that the setter
    has sufficient permissions to perform the rank change. The actual rank update
    logic may involve checking guild permissions, validating the new rank against
    existing ones, and notifying other guild members of the change.
  warnings: Attempting to set a rank higher than the guild's maximum allowed rank
    or setting a rank without proper authorization will likely result in no action
    being taken or an error message being sent to the player. Ensure that all GUIDs
    are valid before calling this method.
