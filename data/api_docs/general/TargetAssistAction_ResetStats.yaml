  brief: Resets the statistics and tracking data used by the target assist AI action.
  description: The ResetStats method clears all internal counters, timers, and state
    information maintained by the TargetAssistAction class. This function is typically
    invoked when an AI agent needs to restart its target assistance behavior, such
    as after completing a combat sequence or when switching targets. It ensures that
    previous engagement data does not interfere with new targeting decisions. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making
    it a simple state reset mechanism.

    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    if (m_targetAssistAction)\n        m_targetAssistAction->ResetStats();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating new target assistance logic
    to ensure clean state. It is commonly used in conjunction with other AI action
    reset methods for consistent behavior during combat transitions.
