documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has a pending teleportation request in the LFG system
  description: The HasPendingTeleport method determines if a specific player currently
    has an active teleportation request within the Looking For Group (LFG) coordination
    system. This method is typically used to prevent duplicate teleportation attempts
    or to manage the state of players who are about to be teleported to a dungeon
    or instance. The check is performed based on the player's GUID and evaluates whether
    their teleportation status is pending in the LFG group coordinator's internal
    tracking mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for
      pending teleport status. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has a pending teleportation request;
    otherwise, returns false. A pending teleport typically means the player is scheduled
    to be teleported but has not yet been moved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for pending teleport
    code: "if (LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(playerGuid))\
      \ {\n    bool hasPendingTeleport = coordinator->HasPendingTeleport(playerGuid);\n\
      \    if (hasPendingTeleport) {\n        // Handle case where player is already\
      \ pending teleport\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Player %u has\
      \ pending teleport\", playerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in LFG state management
    code: "void HandleLFGTeleport(Player* player) {\n    if (sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGUID())\
      \ && \n        sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGUID())->HasPendingTeleport(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n        // Prevent multiple teleport attempts\n        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Teleport already in progress.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with\
      \ teleport logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal LFG group coordinator state tracking. It should
    only be called after ensuring the player is part of an active LFG group. The implementation
    may involve thread-safe access to shared coordinator data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a valid coordinator exists
    for the player may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure proper
    LFG group membership before invoking this check.
