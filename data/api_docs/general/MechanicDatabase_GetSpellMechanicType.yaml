  class: MechanicDatabase
  method: GetSpellMechanicType
  signature: MechanicType MechanicDatabase::GetSpellMechanicType(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mechanic type associated with a specified spell ID from the
    database.
  description: The GetSpellMechanicType method queries the MechanicDatabase to determine
    the mechanic type of a given spell. This is used in World of Warcraft's game mechanics
    to categorize spells based on their interaction with player abilities, such as
    stun, root, silence, or immune effects. The returned MechanicType value helps
    determine how a spell interacts with various game systems, including debuff stacking
    rules, immunity checks, and special behavior overrides. This method is typically
    used during spell processing and effect application to ensure proper handling
    of mechanics like crowd control or status effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MechanicType enum value representing the mechanic type of the
    specified spell. Possible values include common mechanics such as MECHANIC_STUN,
    MECHANIC_ROOT, MECHANIC_SILENCE, MECHANIC_IMMUNE, etc., or MECHANIC_NONE if no
    specific mechanic is defined for the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nMechanicType mechanic = sMechanicDatabase->GetSpellMechanicType(spellId);\n\
      if (mechanic != MECHANIC_NONE)\n{\n    // Process spell based on its mechanic\
      \ type\n    switch (mechanic)\n    {\n        case MECHANIC_STUN:\n        \
      \    // Handle stun effect\n            break;\n        case MECHANIC_ROOT:\n\
      \            // Handle root effect\n            break;\n        default:\n \
      \           break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method accesses a cached database lookup for performance reasons. The
    MechanicDatabase is expected to be pre-loaded with spell mechanic data during
    server initialization. The method is thread-safe as it only performs read operations
    on static data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to an actual existing spell
    in the database, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or return MECHANIC_NONE.
    This method should not be used for spells that are dynamically created or modified
    at runtime without proper database updates.
