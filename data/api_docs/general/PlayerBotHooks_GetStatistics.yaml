  class: PlayerBotHooks
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const HookStatistics & PlayerBotHooks::GetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistics of all registered player bot hooks.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to a HookStatistics
    object that contains aggregated data about the usage and performance of all registered
    player bot hooks within the TrinityCore instance. This includes information such
    as the number of times each hook has been invoked, execution timing data, and
    any error counts. The statistics are updated in real-time as hooks are executed
    during player bot operations. This method is primarily used for monitoring, debugging,
    and performance analysis of the bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a HookStatistics object containing detailed metrics
    about all registered player bot hooks, including invocation counts, execution
    times, and error statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Print Hook Statistics
    code: 'const HookStatistics& stats = playerBotHooks.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total hook invocations: " << stats.totalInvocations << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average execution time: " << stats.averageExecutionTime << "ms"
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned HookStatistics object is read-only and should not be modified
    directly. Statistics are updated atomically to ensure thread safety during concurrent
    bot operations. The statistics may include data from hooks that were registered
    but never executed, so the total invocation count represents all registered hooks
    rather than just active ones.
  warnings: Accessing this method frequently in performance-critical sections may
    introduce overhead due to internal locking mechanisms. The statistics object is
    only valid until the next call to GetStatistics or until the PlayerBotHooks instance
    is destroyed.
