  class: SmartScript
  method: SetPathId
  signature: void SmartScript::SetPathId(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the path ID for the smart script to use for movement.
  description: The SetPathId method assigns a specific path identifier to a SmartScript
    instance, which is used to determine which predefined path the AI-controlled creature
    should follow during movement. This method is typically invoked within SMART_EVENT_MOVEMENTINFORM
    events or other scripted movement triggers to dynamically assign a path for the
    creature to traverse. The path ID corresponds to entries in the creature_movement
    table in the database, allowing for flexible and dynamic path assignment without
    requiring hard-coded movement logic.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the path to be assigned. This value must
      correspond to a valid entry in the creature_movement table's point field or
      similar path identification system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Path ID in a Smart Script
    code: "void OnCreatureEnterCombat(Unit* /*attacker*/) {\n    // Assign path ID\
      \ 12345 for the creature to follow\n    me->GetAI()->SetPathId(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Path ID Based on Event Conditions
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 42)\n        me->GetAI()->SetPathId(54321);\n    else\n        me->GetAI()->SetPathId(11111);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately trigger movement; it only sets the path
    ID that will be used by subsequent movement-related events or functions. The actual
    path execution depends on other components of the SmartScript system and may require
    additional event handling to initiate.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided path ID corresponds to an existing valid path
    in the database, otherwise the creature may not move as expected or could exhibit
    undefined behavior. Avoid calling this method during movement operations that
    are already in progress, as it might cause conflicts or unexpected path switching.
