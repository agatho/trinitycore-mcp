  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: GetMalePercentageForRace
  signature: uint8 BotCharacterDistribution::GetMalePercentageForRace(uint8 race)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the percentage of male characters for a specified race in the bot
    character distribution.
  description: This method retrieves the configured percentage of male characters
    that should be generated for a given race within the bot character distribution
    system. It is used to determine gender distribution ratios when creating bot characters
    for various races in the game. The method takes a race identifier as input and
    returns a uint8 value representing the percentage of males (0-100) for that specific
    race. This functionality supports balanced character generation and ensures diverse
    representation across different races in bot populations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the percentage of male characters for the specified
    race. Valid range is 0-100, where 0 means no males are generated and 100 means
    all characters are male for that race.
  examples:
  - title: Get male percentage for Human race
    code: 'uint8 malePercentage = botDistribution->GetMalePercentageForRace(RACE_HUMAN);

      // Returns the configured percentage of male humans in bot population'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in character creation logic
    code: "if (GetMalePercentageForRace(playerRace) > 50)\n{\n    // More likely to\
      \ generate male characters for this race\n    CreateBotCharacter(playerRace,\
      \ GENDER_MALE);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // More likely to generate female characters\
      \ for this race\n    CreateBotCharacter(playerRace, GENDER_FEMALE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot character distribution system and relies on
    predefined configuration values. The implementation assumes valid race identifiers
    are passed; invalid race IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect percentages.
    This method is typically used during bot character generation to maintain realistic
    gender distributions based on game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the race parameter passed to this method corresponds to valid
    TrinityCore race constants. Passing invalid race values may lead to unexpected
    results or access violations. The returned percentage value should be interpreted
    as a probability distribution rather than an absolute count.
