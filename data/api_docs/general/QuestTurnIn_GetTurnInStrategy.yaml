  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: GetTurnInStrategy
  signature: TurnInStrategy QuestTurnIn::GetTurnInStrategy(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the turn-in strategy for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetTurnInStrategy method determines and returns the appropriate
    turn-in strategy for a given bot based on its unique identifier (GUID). This strategy
    defines how the bot should handle quest completion, including whether it should
    turn in quests automatically, manually, or through specific conditional logic.
    The method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI system to manage automated
    quest progression for bot characters. It evaluates internal bot state and quest
    data to select an appropriate strategy that aligns with the bot's current questing
    behavior and game context.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to retrieve
      the turn-in strategy. Must be a valid GUID representing an active bot in the
      game world.
  returns: Returns a TurnInStrategy enum value indicating how the specified bot should
    handle quest turn-ins. Possible values may include AUTO_TURN_IN, MANUAL_TURN_IN,
    CONDITIONAL_TURN_IN, or similar strategies depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nTurnInStrategy strategy = questTurnIn.GetTurnInStrategy(botGuid);\n\
      if (strategy == TurnInStrategy::AUTO_TURN_IN)\n{\n    // Handle automatic quest\
      \ turn-in logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy-Based Logic
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nTurnInStrategy strategy\
      \ = questTurnIn.GetTurnInStrategy(botGuid);\nswitch (strategy)\n{\n    case\
      \ TurnInStrategy::AUTO_TURN_IN:\n        // Automatically turn in quests\n \
      \       break;\n    case TurnInStrategy::MANUAL_TURN_IN:\n        // Wait for\
      \ manual intervention\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other\
      \ strategies or fallback\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal bot configuration data and quest state
    tracking. The returned strategy may vary based on the bot's current quest log,
    available quest items, and game conditions. Implementation details may involve
    caching or lazy evaluation of strategies to optimize performance during frequent
    calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot in the game
    world; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The method may return unexpected
    results if called before the bot's quest data has been properly initialized.
