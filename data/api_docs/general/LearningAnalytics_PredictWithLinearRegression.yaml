    & values, uint32_t steps) const
documentation:
  brief: Performs linear regression prediction on input data to estimate a future
    value based on historical trends.
  description: 'The PredictWithLinearRegression method implements a simple linear
    regression algorithm to forecast a value based on a sequence of historical data
    points. It takes an array of float values representing time-series data and calculates
    a predicted outcome after a specified number of steps. This functionality is typically
    used in analytics systems within TrinityCore to anticipate trends or behaviors,
    such as player activity patterns, resource consumption rates, or other measurable
    game metrics. The method assumes that the input data follows a roughly linear
    trend and may not perform well with highly volatile or non-linear datasets. Precondition:
    The input vector must contain at least two elements for meaningful regression
    calculation.'
  parameters:
  - name: values
    description: A vector of floating-point numbers representing historical data points
      used to train the linear regression model. Must contain at least two values
      for valid computation.
  - name: steps
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer indicating how many steps ahead to predict.
      A value of 0 returns the last known value, while higher values project further
      into the future.
  returns: Returns a single floating-point number representing the predicted value
    after the specified number of steps using linear regression. The result may be
    extrapolated beyond the range of input data and could be inaccurate if the underlying
    trend changes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Prediction Example
    code: 'std::vector<float> playerLevels = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30};

      float predictedLevel = analytics.PredictWithLinearRegression(playerLevels, 2);

      // Predicts the level after 2 more steps based on current trend'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Consumption Forecasting
    code: 'std::vector<float> cpuUsage = {45.2f, 47.8f, 50.1f, 52.3f, 54.6f};

      float predictedCpu = analytics.PredictWithLinearRegression(cpuUsage, 5);

      // Forecasts CPU usage 5 steps into the future'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a basic least-squares linear regression without any
    smoothing or advanced statistical techniques. It is optimized for performance
    and simplicity rather than accuracy in complex scenarios. For high-precision forecasting,
    consider using more sophisticated algorithms or combining this with additional
    data processing.
  warnings: The prediction accuracy decreases significantly when extrapolating far
    beyond the range of input data. The method does not validate that the data represents
    a linear relationship; it simply fits a line to the points regardless of whether
    such fit is meaningful.
