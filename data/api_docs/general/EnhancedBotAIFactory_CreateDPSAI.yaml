  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateDPSAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateDPSAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new DPS AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateDPSAI method is responsible for generating a new DPS (Damage
    Per Second) artificial intelligence instance for a given bot player within the
    TrinityCore framework. This function typically sets up the necessary AI behavior
    patterns, combat routines, and decision-making logic tailored for maximizing damage
    output. It may involve initializing various AI components such as target selection,
    spell casting sequences, movement strategies, and resource management specific
    to DPS roles. The method ensures that the bot's AI is properly configured to perform
    effectively in combat scenarios while adhering to game mechanics and class-specific
    abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically signifies successful creation, while negative
    values may indicate errors such as invalid player reference, insufficient resources,
    or failed initialization. Positive non-zero values might represent specific status
    codes or identifiers for the created AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic DPS AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nint result = factory->CreateDPSAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Successfully created DPS AI for the bot\n    printf(\"\
      DPS AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n   \
      \ printf(\"Failed to create DPS AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is valid and represents
    a bot character. The actual implementation may involve checking for valid class
    types, ensuring the bot has necessary resources, and setting up appropriate AI
    state machines. Performance considerations include potential memory allocation
    for AI components and initialization overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or an invalid Player pointer can
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized
    and represents a valid bot before invoking this function.
