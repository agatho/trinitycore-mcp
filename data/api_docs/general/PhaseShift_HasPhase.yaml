  class: PhaseShift
  method: HasPhase
  signature: bool PhaseShift::HasPhase(uint32 phaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific phase ID is active within the PhaseShift.
  description: The HasPhase method determines whether a given phase identifier is
    currently active in the PhaseShift object. This functionality is crucial for managing
    game world visibility and event phases in TrinityCore, where different phases
    control what content players can see or interact with. The method performs a lookup
    against the internal phase bitmask or list of active phases to return a boolean
    result indicating presence or absence of the specified phase ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified phase ID is currently active in this PhaseShift;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (phaseShift.HasPhase(1234))\n{\n    // The phase with ID 1234 is currently\
      \ active\n    // Perform actions specific to this phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Phase
    code: "uint32 currentPhase = player->GetPhaseMask();\nif (phaseShift.HasPhase(currentPhase))\n\
      {\n    // Player is in a valid phase for this area\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You are in the correct phase.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not in the required\
      \ phase\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"This area is not available in\
      \ your current phase.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely operates on an internal data structure that tracks active
    phases, such as a bitmask or set of uint32 values. It's important to note that
    phase IDs are typically defined by the game's phase system and may be managed
    through various mechanisms including area triggers, quest states, or world events.
