  method: UpdateCharges
  signature: void MongooseBiteTracker::UpdateCharges()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the charge count for the mongoose bite ability based on current game
    state and cooldown mechanics.
  description: The UpdateCharges method manages the internal tracking of charges available
    for the Mongoose Bite ability within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    is typically invoked when the player's ability state changes, such as after using
    a charge or when the cooldown period resets. It ensures that the charge count
    accurately reflects the game's current state and respects any limitations or modifiers
    imposed by buffs, debuffs, or class-specific mechanics. The method may also trigger
    visual updates or send network packets to synchronize the charge state with the
    client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Ability Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateMongooseBiteCharges()\n{\n    if (m_mongooseBiteTracker)\n\
      \        m_mongooseBiteTracker->UpdateCharges();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Cooldown Reset Logic
    code: "void Player::HandleMongooseBiteCooldownReset()\n{\n    // Reset cooldown\
      \ logic here\n    UpdateCharges(); // Synchronize charges after reset\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine during state transitions
    or periodic updates. Developers should be aware that this function may modify
    internal state variables and could potentially trigger additional callbacks or
    UI updates depending on how it's integrated into the larger system.
  warnings: Improper invocation of UpdateCharges without proper context may lead to
    inconsistent charge states between server and client, resulting in incorrect ability
    usage or visual discrepancies for players. Ensure all related cooldown and buff
    systems are properly synchronized before calling this method.
