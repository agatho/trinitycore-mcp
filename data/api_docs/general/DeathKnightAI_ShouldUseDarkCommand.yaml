  method: ShouldUseDarkCommand
  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::ShouldUseDarkCommand(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Death Knight should use Dark Command ability on a
    target.
  description: This method evaluates if the Death Knight AI should execute the Dark
    Command spell against a specified target. It considers various combat conditions,
    resource availability, and strategic factors to make this decision. The method
    is typically used within the AI's decision-making loop to determine optimal spell
    usage during encounters. This function does not directly cast the spell but returns
    a boolean value indicating whether casting would be beneficial at the current
    moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Dark Command should be used on the target; otherwise, returns
    false. The decision is based on combat state, target conditions, and AI strategy
    parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->ShouldUseDarkCommand(target)) {\n    // Execute Dark\
      \ Command\n    deathKnightAI->DoCast(target, SPELL_DARK_COMMAND);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat decision making
    code: "class MyDeathKnightAI : public DeathKnightAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\
      \ {\n            if (ShouldUseDarkCommand(target)) {\n                DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_DARK_COMMAND);\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n\
      \        // Other AI logic...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers factors such as target proximity, threat level,
    cooldown status of Dark Command, and whether the target is currently affected
    by other control effects. The implementation may also factor in the Death Knight's
    current mana or resource state to ensure optimal spell usage.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target parameter is valid and non-null. Using
    this method without proper target validation may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Additionally, calling this method outside of combat context might produce
    unexpected results if it relies on combat-specific conditions.
