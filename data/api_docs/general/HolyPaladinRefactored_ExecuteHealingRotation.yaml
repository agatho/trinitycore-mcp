documentation:
  brief: Executes the holy paladin's healing rotation logic during combat.
  description: The ExecuteHealingRotation method implements the core healing behavior
    for a holy paladin AI. It evaluates the current combat state, target health percentages,
    and available spells to determine the optimal sequence of healing abilities to
    cast. This method typically integrates with the TrinityCore AI system to provide
    intelligent healing decisions based on threat levels, mana availability, and raid
    composition. The method operates within the context of a combat encounter and
    may adjust its behavior dynamically as conditions change.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void HolyPaladinAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_isInCombat)\n \
      \       m_paladin->ExecuteHealingRotation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within an AI update loop and should
    only be invoked when the paladin is in combat. The implementation assumes that
    the paladin's target and spell availability have already been validated by the
    calling context.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of a valid combat context,
    as it may attempt to access invalid targets or cast spells without proper resource
    checks. The method does not handle spell cooldowns or mana management directly
    - these should be managed by the calling AI system.
