api:
  class: BotSession
  method: PlayerDisconnected
  signature: bool BotSession::PlayerDisconnected() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player associated with this bot session is currently disconnected
    from the server.
  description: The PlayerDisconnected method determines whether the player whose session
    this object represents has been disconnected from the TrinityCore server. This
    is typically used by bot systems to track the connection status of players they
    are controlling or monitoring. The method returns a boolean value indicating the
    current connection state. When a player disconnects, various bot behaviors may
    need to be adjusted or paused until the player reconnects. This check is essential
    for maintaining proper bot operation and preventing errors when attempting to
    interact with disconnected players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently disconnected from the server, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the bot session should not attempt
    to perform actions that require an active player connection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Logic
    code: "if (botSession->PlayerDisconnected()) {\n    // Handle disconnected player\
      \ case\n    botSession->PauseBot();\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Player {} is disconnected,\
      \ pausing bot.\", botSession->GetPlayerGUID());\n} else {\n    // Continue normal\
      \ bot operations\n    botSession->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a check against internal session state rather
    than actively polling the network. It's important to note that this check should
    be performed regularly in bot update loops to ensure timely response to player
    disconnections.
