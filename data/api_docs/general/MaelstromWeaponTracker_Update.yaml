  signature: void MaelstromWeaponTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Maelstrom Weapon tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in MaelstromWeaponTracker is responsible for refreshing
    and synchronizing the state of the Maelstrom Weapon ability for a given player
    bot. This typically involves checking the current cooldown status, tracking charges
    or energy levels, and updating internal game state variables that reflect the
    weapon's readiness. The method ensures that the bot's AI behavior accurately reflects
    the availability of the Maelstrom Weapon ability, which is a key component in
    certain combat strategies within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Maelstrom
      Weapon state needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should
      reference a valid player instance.

  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle to ensure
    real-time tracking of the Maelstrom Weapon ability. It may involve checking spell
    cooldowns, mana costs, and other resource requirements specific to the Maelstrom
    Weapon mechanic.
