  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: GetGcdCache
  signature: int & CooldownCalculator::GetGcdCache()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the global cooldown cache value used for calculating
    spell cast times in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetGcdCache method retrieves a reference to an internal integer
    value that represents the current global cooldown (GCD) cache. In TrinityCore,
    this value is typically used to determine how long a player must wait between
    casting spells, as dictated by the game's GCD mechanics. The returned reference
    allows direct access and modification of this cached GCD value, which can be useful
    for custom logic or debugging purposes. This method is commonly invoked during
    spell processing to ensure that cooldowns are properly enforced according to the
    game's timing rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current global cooldown cache
    value. This value usually corresponds to the milliseconds remaining in the GCD,
    and modifying it directly affects subsequent spell casting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing GCD Cache Value
    code: 'int& gcd = calculator.GetGcdCache();

      // Use the reference to modify or read the current GCD value

      gcd = 1000; // Set GCD to 1 second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading Current GCD Value for Debugging
    code: 'int& currentGcd = calculator.GetGcdCache();

      std::cout << "Current GCD: " << currentGcd << "ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal cached value. Modifying this
    value directly impacts spell casting behavior and should be done carefully, especially
    in multi-threaded environments or when dealing with player actions. The GCD cache
    is typically updated by the game engine based on various factors such as player
    class, equipped items, and active buffs/debuffs.
  warnings: Directly modifying the returned reference can lead to unexpected behavior
    if not handled properly. Changes to the GCD cache may affect spell timing, combat
    flow, and player experience. Ensure thread safety when accessing or modifying
    this value from different contexts.
