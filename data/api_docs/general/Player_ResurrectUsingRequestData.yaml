  brief: Resurrects the player using data from a resurrection request.
  description: This method handles the process of resurrecting a player based on data
    received from a resurrection request, typically triggered by a spirit release
    or resurrection spell. It ensures that the player's resurrection state is properly
    managed and that any pending resurrection effects are cleared. The method is commonly
    used in conjunction with other resurrection-related functionality to restore player
    health and mana upon resurrection.

    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ResurrectUsingRequestData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when the player is in a state where resurrection
    is expected, such as after being killed or during spirit release. It typically
    involves clearing any pending resurrection effects and restoring player health/mana.
  warnings: This method should not be used outside of proper resurrection context;
    calling it without appropriate data may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    player state.
