  brief: Initializes a PvP combat AI instance for an NPC or creature.
  description: The PvPCombatAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for creatures
    that are designed to engage in player-versus-player combat. This constructor sets
    up internal state variables and prepares the AI to handle PvP-specific logic such
    as targeting players, managing combat behaviors, and responding to PvP-related
    events. It is typically invoked during the creation or initialization phase of
    a creature that is meant to participate in PvP scenarios within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      PvPCombatAI* ai = new PvPCombatAI(creature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the AI system in TrinityCore and should only
    be called on creatures that are explicitly configured for PvP combat. The AI will
    not function properly if used with non-PvP creatures or without proper creature
    setup.
