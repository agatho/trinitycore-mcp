  class: DiseaseManager
  method: ApplyDisease
  signature: void DiseaseManager::ApplyDisease(Unit * target, DiseaseType type, int
    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a disease effect to the specified target unit with the given disease
    type and spell ID.
  description: The ApplyDisease method is used to inflict a disease condition on a
    target Unit within the TrinityCore framework. This method handles the application
    of various disease effects such as poison, plague, or other debuffs that are commonly
    found in World of Warcraft gameplay. It takes into account the target unit's resistance,
    immunity, and existing disease states to determine whether the disease is successfully
    applied. The method uses the provided spell ID to reference the specific disease
    effect properties defined in the game's spell database. This functionality is
    typically invoked during combat situations or when applying status effects through
    spells or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the disease effect.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing unit in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The DiseaseType enum value specifying the type of disease to apply
      (e.g., DISEASE_TYPE_POISON, DISEASE_TYPE_DISEASE). Defines the nature and behavior
      of the disease effect.
  - name: spellId
    description: Integer identifier for the spell that defines the disease properties.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database containing
      disease-related effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Disease Application
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      DiseaseManager::ApplyDisease(target, DISEASE_TYPE_POISON, 34523);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Disease with Conditional Check
    code: "if (target && target->IsAlive()) {\n    DiseaseManager::ApplyDisease(target,\
      \ DISEASE_TYPE_DISEASE, 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the unit's aura system to apply disease
    effects. The spell ID parameter is crucial as it determines the duration, tick
    rate, and damage properties of the applied disease. The method may perform checks
    for immunity or resistance before applying the disease effect.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to an existing unit
    to prevent undefined behavior. The spellId must reference a valid disease spell
    in the database; otherwise, the disease application may fail silently or cause
    unexpected behavior.
