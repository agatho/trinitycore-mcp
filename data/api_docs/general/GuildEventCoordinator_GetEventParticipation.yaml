  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: GetEventParticipation
  signature: EventParticipation GuildEventCoordinator::GetEventParticipation(uint32
    playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the event participation status for a specified player within the
    guild.
  description: The GetEventParticipation method fetches the current event participation
    record associated with a given player's GUID. This function is typically used
    to determine whether a player has registered for or participated in specific guild
    events such as battlegrounds, raids, or other organized activities. It returns
    an EventParticipation object that contains information about the player's registration
    status, event type, and any related metadata. The method assumes that the player
    GUID corresponds to a valid guild member and will return appropriate default values
    if no participation record exists for the specified player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose event participation
      status is being retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: An EventParticipation object containing the player's event registration
    details, including event type, registration timestamp, and participation status.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized EventParticipation if no record exists
    for the specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nEventParticipation participation = guildEventCoordinator->GetEventParticipation(playerId);\n\
      if (participation.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the event participation data\n\
      \    printf(\"Player registered for event: %u\\n\", participation.GetEventType());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Participation Status
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nEventParticipation participation = guildEventCoordinator->GetEventParticipation(playerId);\n\
      if (participation.GetStatus() == EVENT_PARTICIPATION_STATUS_REGISTERED) {\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is registered for the event\\n\");\n} else if (participation.GetStatus()\
      \ == EVENT_PARTICIPATION_STATUS_ATTENDED) {\n    printf(\"Player attended the\
      \ event\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Player has no participation record\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups and should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical sections of code. The returned EventParticipation object
    is typically lightweight but may contain references to cached data that could
    become stale if not properly synchronized with the underlying event system.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid is a valid and registered player GUID before calling
    this method, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or database errors.
    This function should not be called from within a transaction context without proper
    synchronization.
