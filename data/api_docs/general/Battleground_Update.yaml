  class: Battleground
  method: Update
  signature: void Battleground::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground state and handles game logic for the specified time
    difference.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing all active battleground
    mechanics and state changes over a given time interval. It manages player interactions,
    scoring, objective captures, and other dynamic elements within the battleground
    framework. This method is typically called from the game loop at regular intervals
    to ensure real-time updates of battleground conditions. The method processes events
    such as player deaths, flag captures, and win/loss conditions based on the time
    delta provided.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has passed and affects the rate of game logic
      advancement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic battleground update call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBattlegrounds()\n{\n    for (auto& bg : sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegrounds())\n\
      \    {\n        if (bg)\n            bg->Update(1000); // Update with 1 second\
      \ time delta\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently by the game server's main loop and should
    be optimized for performance. It handles all battleground-specific logic including
    player movement, combat resolution, and objective handling. The diff parameter
    is crucial for maintaining consistent game timing across different server loads.
