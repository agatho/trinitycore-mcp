  method: CalculateFairValue
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::CalculateFairValue(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the fair market value for a specified item based on
    current auction house data and historical pricing trends.
  description: The CalculateFairValue method determines the estimated fair market
    value of an item by analyzing recent auction house activity, including bid prices,
    buyout prices, and sales volume. This method is typically used within the context
    of World of Warcraft's auction house system to provide players with realistic
    price estimates for items they are considering buying or selling. The calculation
    takes into account various factors such as item rarity, level requirements, and
    market demand. It is important to note that this value may fluctuate dynamically
    based on real-time market conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float representing the calculated fair market value of the specified
    item. This value is expressed in copper coins and reflects an estimated equilibrium
    price based on current market data. A return value of 0.0 indicates that no valid
    pricing data could be retrieved for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float fairValue = marketAnalysis.CalculateFairValue(18832); // Calculates
      fair value for a specific item ID

      printf("Fair value: %f copper\n", fairValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on up-to-date auction house data and may require sufficient
    market activity to produce accurate results. The implementation likely caches
    recent calculations for performance optimization, but may recalculate values when
    significant market changes occur.
  warnings: The returned value is an estimate and may not reflect actual transaction
    prices due to market manipulation or unusual circumstances. Developers should
    consider that this method might return zero if no pricing data exists for the
    requested item ID.
