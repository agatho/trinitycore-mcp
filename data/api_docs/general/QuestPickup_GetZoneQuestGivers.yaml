  signature: int QuestPickup::GetZoneQuestGivers(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of quest givers within a specified zone
  description: The GetZoneQuestGivers method returns the count of active quest givers
    (NPCs or objects that offer quests) in the specified zone. This method is typically
    used by the quest system to determine how many NPCs are available to provide quests
    in a given area. The method performs a lookup within the TrinityCore database
    or cached data structures to compile this information. It does not return the
    actual quest giver identifiers, but rather the total count of such entities. This
    can be useful for quest progression checks, zone-based quest availability calculations,
    and UI display logic that needs to know how many quest givers are present in a
    zone.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of quest givers found in the specified
    zone. Returns 0 if no quest givers are found or if the zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest giver count in a zone
    code: "uint32 zoneId = 141; // Elwynn Forest\nint questGiverCount = questPickup->GetZoneQuestGivers(zoneId);\n\
      if (questGiverCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Found %d quest givers in Elwynn Forest\\\
      n\", questGiverCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal caching of zone data and may not reflect
    real-time changes to quest givers. The implementation might query database tables
    related to creature quests or game object quests. Performance is generally good
    for cached lookups, but frequent calls with many zones could impact performance.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes a uint32 parameter (zoneId), but
    the documentation states no parameters. This discrepancy should be resolved in
    the actual implementation. The returned count may not include dynamic or temporary
    quest givers that are created during runtime and not persisted in static zone
    data.
