documentation:
  brief: Executes all registered module startup callbacks in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The CallOnStartup method iterates through all modules that have registered
    their initialization functions and invokes them in the appropriate order. This
    method is typically called during the server startup process to ensure that all
    modules are properly initialized before the server begins accepting connections.
    It serves as a central coordination point for module initialization, allowing
    each module to perform necessary setup operations such as registering event handlers,
    initializing data structures, or configuring subsystems. The method does not accept
    any parameters and returns no value, making it a simple yet critical part of the
    server's boot sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in server startup
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ModuleManager::Instance()->CallOnStartup();\n    // Continue with remaining\
      \ startup procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the server's initialization phase.
    It is not thread-safe and must be executed from the main thread. Module initialization
    order may be significant, so dependencies between modules should be considered
    when implementing startup callbacks.
