  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::LearnFlightPath(Creature * flightMaster)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches the player all available flight paths from a specified flight master
    creature.
  description: The LearnFlightPath method enables a player to learn all available
    flight paths from a given Flight Master creature. This method typically checks
    if the player has the necessary prerequisites, such as having completed required
    quests or reaching sufficient level, before adding the flight paths to their known
    routes. It is commonly used during quest completion or when interacting with flight
    masters in the game world. The function returns true if the operation was successful
    and all flight paths were learned, or false if any error occurred during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: flightMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the Flight Master from
      which to learn flight paths. Must be a valid creature instance of type Flight
      Master.
  returns: Returns true if all flight paths were successfully learned and added to
    the player's known routes, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    invalid input, missing prerequisites, or internal errors during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->GetFlightMasterManager()->LearnFlightPath(flightMasterCreature))\
      \ {\n    // Flight paths successfully learned\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      All flight paths learned!\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to learn flight paths\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Failed to learn flight paths.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's quest log and flight path
    database. It may also trigger updates to the player's UI to reflect newly learned
    flight routes. The method assumes that the provided Creature pointer is valid
    and represents a legitimate Flight Master.
  warnings: Ensure that the flightMaster parameter is not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Additionally, this function may have performance implications if called frequently
    in loops or during high-frequency events.
