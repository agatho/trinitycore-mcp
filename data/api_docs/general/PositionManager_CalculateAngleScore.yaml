documentation:
  brief: Calculates a scoring value based on angle alignment for positioning decisions
    in movement contexts.
  description: The CalculateAngleScore method computes a float score that represents
    how well a given position aligns with the current movement context's angular requirements.
    This is typically used in AI pathfinding or positioning logic to evaluate candidate
    positions based on directional preferences or constraints. The score may be utilized
    to prioritize movement targets or determine optimal positioning relative to entities
    or objectives. The method takes into account the provided position index and evaluates
    it against the context's angle-related parameters such as desired facing direction,
    allowed deviation, or target orientation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the index or identifier of a candidate position
      to evaluate. This value is typically used to reference a specific point in a
      positioning array or list.
  - name: context
    description: A reference to a MovementContext object that contains contextual
      data about movement requirements, including target direction, allowed angle
      deviation, and other relevant parameters for scoring.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated angle score. Higher scores typically
    indicate better alignment with the movement context's angular constraints, while
    lower scores suggest poor alignment. The exact interpretation of score values
    depends on the internal implementation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI pathfinding
    code: "float score = positionManager.CalculateAngleScore(5, movementContext);\n\
      if (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Position is well-aligned with current movement context\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using angle score to select best position
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < positions.size();\
      \ ++i) {\n    float currentScore = positionManager.CalculateAngleScore(i, context);\n\
      \    if (currentScore > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = currentScore;\n  \
      \      bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for movement target"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger positioning or pathfinding system
    and may be used in conjunction with other scoring functions. It assumes that the
    MovementContext object has valid angular data and that the position index is within
    bounds. The implementation may involve trigonometric calculations for angle comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter does not exceed the bounds of any internal
    position arrays or lists, as accessing invalid indices could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, verify that the MovementContext object contains valid data before
    calling this method to avoid incorrect scoring results.
