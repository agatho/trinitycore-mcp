  method: RecordFailure
  signature: void DeathRecoveryStatistics::RecordFailure()
documentation:
  brief: Records a death recovery failure event in the statistics tracking system.
  description: The RecordFailure method logs a death recovery attempt that has failed
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked when a player's
    death recovery mechanism does not succeed, such as when a resurrection fails or
    when a player cannot be recovered from death due to game rules or server limitations.
    The method updates internal statistics counters and may trigger additional logging
    or event handling based on the server configuration. It is part of the DeathRecoveryStatistics
    class which manages tracking of death recovery events for analytics and gameplay
    balance purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handler
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    if (!CanRecoverFromDeath())\n    {\n\
      \        sDeathRecoveryStats->RecordFailure();\n        // Additional death\
      \ handling logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the core death handling system and
    may increment internal failure counters that are used for server performance monitoring
    or player behavior analysis. The statistics collected by this method could be
    used to balance gameplay mechanics or identify potential issues with the death
    recovery system.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when a death recovery attempt has
    actually failed, not during normal gameplay events. Calling it incorrectly may
    skew statistics and affect game balance metrics.
