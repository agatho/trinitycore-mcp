  signature: uint16 WorldObject::GetMeleeAnimKitId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the melee animation kit ID associated with this WorldObject.
  description: The GetMeleeAnimKitId method returns the unique identifier of the melee
    animation kit that is assigned to this WorldObject. Animation kits in World of
    Warcraft define how a unit performs melee attacks, including the specific animations
    and visual effects used during combat. This ID is typically set during creature
    creation or through game mechanics such as spell effects or buffs that modify
    an NPC's attack behavior. The returned value corresponds to entries in the AnimKit
    database table and determines which animations are played when the object performs
    melee attacks. This method does not perform any validation on the returned ID,
    so it may return zero if no animation kit has been assigned.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the melee animation kit ID associated with
    this WorldObject. A value of 0 typically indicates that no specific melee animation
    kit is assigned, and the object will use a default or fallback animation sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Melee Animation Kit
    code: "uint16 animKitId = creature->GetMeleeAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Creature has a custom melee animation kit\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Creature %u uses melee anim kit %u\", creature->GetGUID().GetCounter(), animKitId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No specific animation kit, using default\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Creature %u uses default melee animations\", creature->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Animation Kit ID in Combat Logic
    code: "// Example of checking if a creature has a specific animation kit before\
      \ applying effects\nuint16 kitId = unit->GetMeleeAnimKitId();\nif (kitId ==\
      \ 12345)\n{\n    // Apply special effect for creatures using this animation\
      \ kit\n    unit->AddAura(SPELL_ID_SPECIAL_MELEE_EFFECT, unit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in combat-related systems and AI logic to determine
    how a creature performs melee attacks. The animation kit ID can be modified at
    runtime via various game effects such as spells or Auras that change an object's
    combat behavior. It is important to note that this value may not always reflect
    the actual animation being played if other systems override it during runtime.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value means the animation kit is
    valid or exists in the database. The returned ID should be validated against the
    AnimKit table for correctness in critical gameplay logic.
