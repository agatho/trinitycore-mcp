documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum distance threshold for kiting behavior in combat.
  description: The SetMinDistance method configures the minimum distance that a creature
    or player must maintain from an enemy during kiting mechanics. This distance acts
    as a safety threshold to prevent the unit from getting too close to its target,
    which could result in melee attacks or other undesirable combat behaviors. The
    value is typically used in conjunction with other kiting parameters such as maximum
    distance and movement speed to define the overall kiting strategy. This method
    directly modifies an internal state variable within the KitingManager class that
    governs how the AI behaves during pursuit and evasion scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Setting Minimum Kiting Distance
    code: 'KitingManager* kiter = unit->GetKitingManager();

      kiter->SetMinDistance(5.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating kiting behavior to ensure
    proper initialization. The minimum distance value is typically expressed in yards
    and affects the AI's decision-making process during combat encounters.
