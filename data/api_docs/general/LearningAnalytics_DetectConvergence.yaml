documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a set of learning data points has reached convergence
    based on statistical analysis.
  description: The DetectConvergence method evaluates a sequence of learning data
    points to determine if the learning process has stabilized or converged. It analyzes
    trends in the data to identify when further iterations are unlikely to produce
    significant improvements. This method is typically used in machine learning or
    adaptive systems within the game's AI framework to optimize training processes
    and reduce unnecessary computational overhead. The method requires a minimum number
    of data points to perform meaningful analysis, and it returns true if convergence
    criteria are met, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the learning data points show signs of convergence, indicating
    that further iterations would likely not improve results significantly. Returns
    false if convergence has not yet been achieved or if insufficient data is available
    for analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::deque<LearningDataPoint> dataPoints;\n\
      // Populate dataPoints with learning data\nbool converged = analytics.DetectConvergence(dataPoints);\n\
      if (converged) {\n    // Stop training or adjust parameters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input data points are ordered chronologically
    and that each point contains sufficient statistical information for convergence
    analysis. Performance may be affected by large data sets, as the method needs
    to process all points to determine convergence patterns.
  warnings: The method may return false even when convergence is actually achieved
    if the data does not meet internal thresholds or if the convergence criteria are
    too strict. Developers should ensure that data points contain meaningful values
    before calling this method.
