documentation:
  brief: Sets the health percentage threshold for switching target assistance behavior
    in AI.
  description: The SetSwitchHealthThreshold method configures the health percentage
    at which an AI-controlled unit will switch its target assistance behavior. This
    threshold determines when the AI should change its focus from one target to another
    based on health conditions. The method accepts a float value representing the
    health percentage (0.0 to 100.0) below which the AI will consider switching targets.
    This functionality is commonly used in group-based combat scenarios where units
    need to prioritize healing or focusing on targets that are critically low on health.
    The setting affects the decision-making process of target selection within the
    AI's target assist system.
  parameters:
  - name: healthPct
    description: The health percentage threshold (0.0 to 100.0) at which the AI will
      switch target assistance behavior. Values below this threshold trigger the switching
      mechanism.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Health Threshold for Target Switching
    code: 'TargetAssistAction* action = new TargetAssistAction();

      action->SetSwitchHealthThreshold(30.0f); // Switch targets when health drops
      below 30%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Dynamic Target Switching Based on Combat Scenario
    code: "TargetAssistAction* assistAction = GetAI()->GetTargetAssistAction();\n\
      if (IsInCombat())\n{\n    assistAction->SetSwitchHealthThreshold(25.0f); //\
      \ More aggressive switching during active combat\n}\nelse\n{\n    assistAction->SetSwitchHealthThreshold(50.0f);\
      \ // Less aggressive switching when not in combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI's target selection logic and should
    be used carefully in scenarios involving multiple units or complex group dynamics.
    The threshold value is typically interpreted as a percentage of maximum health,
    where values closer to 0.0 indicate more aggressive switching behavior.
  warnings: Setting the health threshold too low may cause excessive target switching
    during combat, potentially disrupting group coordination. Ensure that the threshold
    value aligns with intended gameplay mechanics and does not create unintended behavior
    in AI decision-making.
