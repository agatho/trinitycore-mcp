documentation:
  brief: Records a combat state snapshot for analysis
  description: The RecordSnapshot method captures the current combat state of a unit
    or player, including relevant metrics such as health, mana, position, and active
    combat flags. This data is typically stored for later analysis to determine combat
    effectiveness, identify patterns in player behavior, or evaluate performance during
    encounters. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other combat analysis
    tools within TrinityCore's framework to provide comprehensive combat statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.RecordSnapshot();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Event Handler
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* unit)\n{\n    CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer(unit);\n\
      \    analyzer.RecordSnapshot();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called at strategic points during combat to ensure
    accurate state capture. The snapshot data is typically stored in an internal buffer
    and may be flushed or processed later depending on the implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently during active combat may impact performance.
    Ensure that combat state snapshots are only recorded when necessary for analysis
    purposes.
