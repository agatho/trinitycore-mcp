  method: SetMinionGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetMinionGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of a minion for the Unit.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a minion associated
    with the Unit, allowing the system to track and manage the minion's properties
    within the game world. The GUID is typically used to identify specific creatures
    or objects in the game environment, and this method ensures that the minion's
    identity is properly set for subsequent operations such as movement, combat, or
    interaction with other game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the minion to be set. This value
      represents a valid object ID in the game world and must be consistent with the
      expected format for creature or object GUIDs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetMinionGUID(12345);

      // The minion''s GUID is now set to 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully as it directly affects the internal state
    of the Unit. It is recommended to ensure that the GUID being assigned is valid
    and corresponds to an existing object in the game world before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid GUID assignments, which
    may cause issues with object tracking or game mechanics. Ensure that the GUID
    value is valid and properly formatted for the game environment.
