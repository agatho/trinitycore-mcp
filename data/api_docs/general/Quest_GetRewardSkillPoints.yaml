documentation:
  brief: Returns the skill points awarded for completing the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the skill points that are granted to the player
    upon completing a quest. The returned value represents the amount of skill points
    that will be added to the player's skill points when the quest is completed. This
    is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods to determine
    the total rewards for a quest. The method is part of the Quest class and provides
    access to the skill point reward information without requiring any parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of skill points that will be awarded to the player upon
    quest completion, which can range from 0 to several hundred depending on the quest's
    difficulty and design.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 skillPoints = quest->GetRewardSkillPoints();\nif (skillPoints >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process the skill points reward\n    // This could involve adding\
      \ to player's skill points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    like GetRewardXP, GetRewardGold, and GetRewardItem. It is important to note that
    the skill points awarded may vary based on the quest's level and difficulty. The
    method is read-only and does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when determining rewards for quests,
    as incorrect handling of skill point values can lead to imbalances in player progression
    or game mechanics. Also, if a quest has no skill points reward, this method will
    return 0, which might be confused with an error condition.
