documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureStaticFlagsHolder with specified static flags for creature
    behavior and properties.
  description: The CreatureStaticFlagsHolder constructor initializes an instance with
    a set of static flags that define various behaviors, properties, and characteristics
    of a creature in the TrinityCore environment. These flags control aspects such
    as movement patterns, AI behavior, combat states, and interaction modes. The constructor
    accepts up to eight distinct flag sets (flags1 through flags8) which are typically
    used to represent different categories or layers of creature-specific configurations.
    This initialization is crucial for setting up the baseline static properties that
    govern how a creature interacts with the game world and responds to various triggers
    or events.

  notes: This constructor is typically called during creature creation or loading
    from database. The flags are usually defined in the creature_template table and
    loaded into memory when a creature instance is spawned. It's important to note
    that these static flags are set once at initialization and generally do not change
    during runtime unless explicitly modified by game mechanics.
  warnings: Incorrect flag combinations may lead to unexpected creature behavior or
    even crashes if incompatible flags are set simultaneously. Developers should ensure
    proper flag validation before instantiation, especially when working with custom
    creature templates.
