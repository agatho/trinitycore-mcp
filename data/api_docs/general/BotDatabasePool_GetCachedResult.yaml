  signature: int BotDatabasePool::GetCachedResult(const std::string & key)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a cached database result value associated with the specified key
    from the bot database pool.
  description: The GetCachedResult method fetches a pre-fetched or cached integer
    result from the BotDatabasePool's internal cache using a provided string key.
    This method is typically used to avoid repeated database queries for frequently
    accessed data, improving performance in bot-related systems. The method assumes
    that a result has already been cached under the given key via a prior call to
    a caching mechanism such as SetCachedResult or an initial database fetch operation.
    If no cached value exists for the specified key, the behavior may return a default
    or invalid value, depending on implementation details. This functionality is particularly
    useful in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments where bot systems need efficient
    access to persistent data without excessive database overhead.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cached result value associated with the specified
    key. If no cache entry exists for the key, it may return a default value (e.g.,
    -1 or 0) indicating an invalid or missing cache entry, though exact behavior depends
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Cached Bot Configuration Value
    code: "int botLevel = botDatabasePool.GetCachedResult(\"bot_config_level\");\n\
      if (botLevel > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with using the cached level value\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Bot level retrieved from cache: \" << botLevel << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle missing or invalid cache entry\n    std::cerr << \"\
      Failed to retrieve bot level from cache.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal caching system managed by BotDatabasePool.
    It should only be called after ensuring that a value has been previously cached
    under the specified key. The cache is likely thread-safe but may require synchronization
    depending on how it's implemented within the larger TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Ensure that keys passed to this method are valid and have corresponding
    entries in the cache; otherwise, unexpected behavior or incorrect results may
    occur. Also, be cautious about using this method in high-frequency loops where
    performance could be impacted if cache invalidation is not handled properly.
