  class: AfflictionDoTTracker
  method: RemoveDoT
  signature: void AfflictionDoTTracker::RemoveDoT(int targetGuid, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a DoT effect from a target based on spell ID and target GUID.
  description: The RemoveDoT method is responsible for eliminating a specific Damage
    over Time (DoT) spell effect from a targeted creature or player within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function typically operates as part of the AfflictionDoTTracker
    class, which manages the application and removal of affliction-based DoT spells
    such as Corruption, Unstable Affliction, or other similar effects. The method
    identifies the specific DoT by its spell ID and target GUID, ensuring that only
    the correct effect is removed from the target's aura list. It is commonly invoked
    when a DoT is refreshed, replaced, or when the duration of the effect expires
    naturally.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit from which the DoT
      effect should be removed. This value must correspond to a valid creature or
      player in the world.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID of the specific DoT effect to remove. This ID uniquely
      identifies the type of DoT being removed, such as Corruption (spell ID 172,
      for example).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Corruption DoT from a target
    code: 'AfflictionDoTTracker tracker;

      ObjectGuid targetGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Unit>(12345);

      tracker.RemoveDoT(targetGuid, 172); // Removes Corruption DoT'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a DoT from multiple targets
    code: "AfflictionDoTTracker tracker;\nstd::vector<ObjectGuid> targets = {ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Unit>(12345),\
      \ ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Unit>(12346)};\nfor (auto guid : targets)\n{\n\
      \    tracker.RemoveDoT(guid, 30101); // Removes Unstable Affliction DoT\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target exists and has an active DoT aura with
    the specified spell ID. It should be called only when a DoT is no longer applicable
    or needs to be replaced by another effect. The implementation likely interacts
    with the target's aura system, removing the corresponding aura application from
    the unit.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the DoT exists on the target
    may lead to undefined behavior or errors in the aura system. Ensure the spell
    ID and target GUID are valid before invoking this function.
