  method: ProfileCallFrame
  signature: void ProfileCallFrame::ProfileCallFrame(const std::string & func, const
    std::string & file, uint32_t line)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new profile call frame with function, file, and line information
    for performance monitoring.
  description: The ProfileCallFrame constructor initializes a profiling entry used
    by TrinityCore's performance analysis tools. It records metadata about where a
    function is called from, including the function name, source file, and line number.
    This data is essential for profiling system performance, identifying bottlenecks,
    and optimizing game code execution. The constructor typically operates as part
    of a scoped profiling mechanism, often used in conjunction with RAII (Resource
    Acquisition Is Initialization) patterns to automatically track function entry
    and exit times. When called, it sets up internal tracking structures that are
    later used by the profiling system to generate detailed performance reports.
  parameters:
  - name: func
    description: The name of the function being profiled, typically passed as __FUNCTION__
      or similar compiler-specific macro
  - name: file
    description: The source file name where the function is defined, typically passed
      as __FILE__ macro
  - name: line
    description: The line number in the source file where the function call occurs,
      typically passed as __LINE__ macro
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Scope
    code: "void SomeGameFunction() {\n    PROFILE_CALL_FRAME(\"SomeGameFunction\"\
      , __FILE__, __LINE__);\n    // Function implementation here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Custom Profiling Macro
    code: "#define PROFILE_FUNCTION() ProfileCallFrame profile(__FUNCTION__, __FILE__,\
      \ __LINE__);\n\nvoid AnotherFunction() {\n    PROFILE_FUNCTION();\n    // Function\
      \ body\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used in conjunction with a profiling macro
    system. The ProfileCallFrame object is usually created on the stack and automatically
    destroyed when going out of scope, which triggers automatic timing and reporting.
    The implementation relies on compiler-specific macros like __FUNCTION__, __FILE__,
    and __LINE__ to capture accurate source location information.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this constructor without proper profiling infrastructure
    can lead to compilation errors or runtime issues. Developers should ensure that
    profiling is enabled in the build configuration before using these profiling constructs,
    as they may be compiled out in release builds.
