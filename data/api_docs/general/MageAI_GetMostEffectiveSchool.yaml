  class: MageAI
  method: GetMostEffectiveSchool
  signature: MageSchool MageAI::GetMostEffectiveSchool(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the most effective magic school for a mage to use against a given
    target.
  description: The GetMostEffectiveSchool method evaluates the current combat situation
    and target properties to determine which MageSchool (Arcane, Fire, Frost, Shadow,
    Nature, or Holy) would be most effective for a mage AI to cast. This decision
    is based on factors such as target resistances, debuffs, and the mage's available
    spells. The method ensures optimal spell selection for maximum damage or utility
    in the current context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MageSchool enum value representing the most effective magic school
    for the AI to use against the specified target. Possible values include Arcane,
    Fire, Frost, Shadow, Nature, and Holy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Logic
    code: "void MageAI::DoNextAction()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    if\
      \ (target)\n    {\n        MageSchool school = GetMostEffectiveSchool(target);\n\
      \        switch (school)\n        {\n            case MAGE_SCHOOL_FIRE:\n  \
      \              // Cast Fireball\n                break;\n            case MAGE_SCHOOL_FROST:\n\
      \                // Cast Frostbolt\n                break;\n            // ...\
      \ other cases\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers target resistance values, existing debuffs on
    the target, and the mage's current spell cooldowns. It may also factor in the
    mage's current mana levels and spell priorities. The implementation should be
    efficient as it's called frequently during combat decisions.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target is valid and accessible. If used with
    a null or invalid target, behavior is undefined. This method should only be called
    when the AI has a valid combat target to avoid incorrect spell selection.
