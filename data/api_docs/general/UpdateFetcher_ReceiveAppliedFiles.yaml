  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: ReceiveAppliedFiles
  signature: AppliedFileStorage UpdateFetcher::ReceiveAppliedFiles() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the collection of applied files from the update fetcher.
  description: The ReceiveAppliedFiles method returns an AppliedFileStorage object
    containing all files that have been successfully applied during the update process.
    This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft patch management
    or data synchronization systems within TrinityCore. The returned storage object
    holds metadata about each applied file, including version information and application
    status. The method does not modify any internal state of the UpdateFetcher instance
    and is safe to call multiple times. It's commonly invoked after a successful update
    cycle to verify which files were processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AppliedFileStorage object containing all applied files. This storage
    object provides access to individual file records with their metadata such as
    version, checksum, and application timestamps.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "UpdateFetcher fetcher;\nAppliedFileStorage appliedFiles = fetcher.ReceiveAppliedFiles();\n\
      for (const auto& file : appliedFiles.GetFiles()) {\n    std::cout << \"Applied\
      \ file: \" << file.GetName() << \" (version: \" << file.GetVersion() << \")\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after an update operation has completed successfully.
    The AppliedFileStorage object returned may be empty if no files were applied during
    the current session. The method is thread-safe and can be safely called from multiple
    threads concurrently.
