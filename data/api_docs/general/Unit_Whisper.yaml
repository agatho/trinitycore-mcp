documentation:
  brief: Sends a whisper message to a target player or group using a specific text
    ID
  description: The Whisper method allows a Unit (such as a NPC or player) to send
    a whispered message to a target player or group using a predefined text ID. This
    method is commonly used in World of Warcraft for communication between NPCs and
    players, or between players and groups during quest interactions. The method supports
    both regular whispers and boss whispers, which are typically used for special
    events or boss encounters. It can be used to send messages that are defined in
    the game's database, such as quest dialogues or NPC dialogue.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The unique identifier for the text message to be sent. This ID corresponds
      to a specific entry in the game's database table (e.g., `creature_text` or `npc_text`)
      and defines what message will be displayed to the target player.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player or group that will receive the whisper.
      This can be a pointer to a Player object, a Group object, or NULL if targeting
      a specific player directly. If NULL, it typically targets the player who initiated
      the action.
  - name: isBossWhisper
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a boss whisper (true) or
      regular whisper (false). Boss whispers are typically used for special events
      and may have different behavior in terms of message delivery or visibility compared
      to regular whispers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Whisper Usage
    code: 'Unit* npc = GetUnit();

      Player* target = GetPlayer();


      npc->Whisper(12345, &target, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Whisper Example
    code: 'Unit* boss = GetUnit();

      Group* group = GetGroup();


      boss->Whisper(54321, &group, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically uses the TrinityCore''s internal
    messaging system to send text messages to players. It may involve checking if
    the target is within range or using specific communication channels depending
    on the context. Performance considerations: The method should be used carefully
    in high-frequency scenarios as it can impact server performance if used excessively.
    Thread safety: This method is generally thread-safe when used with proper synchronization,
    but care must be taken when dealing with shared objects across multiple threads.'
  warnings: Common mistakes include using invalid text IDs which will result in no
    message being sent or incorrect targeting. Dangerous edge cases include sending
    whispers to players who are not in range or have disconnected from the server,
    which can cause errors or crashes if not handled properly. Also, using a NULL
    pointer for target can lead to undefined behavior.
