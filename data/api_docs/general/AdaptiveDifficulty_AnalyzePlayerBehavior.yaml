documentation:
  brief: Analyzes player behavior to determine adaptive difficulty scaling factor
  description: The AnalyzePlayerBehavior method evaluates various aspects of a player's
    performance and engagement within the game environment to compute an adaptive
    difficulty scaling factor. This factor is used by the AdaptiveDifficulty system
    to dynamically adjust challenge levels for encounters based on individual player
    capabilities, playstyle, and engagement patterns. The method considers metrics
    such as damage output, survival rate, resource management, and completion time
    to generate a normalized score between 0.0 and 2.0, where values above 1.0 indicate
    above-average performance and values below 1.0 suggest below-average performance
    relative to the baseline difficulty setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the adaptive difficulty scaling factor.
    Values range from 0.0 (minimum difficulty) to 2.0 (maximum difficulty), with 1.0
    indicating normal difficulty. Higher values increase challenge, while lower values
    decrease it based on player performance analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* diff = sWorld->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();

      float scale = diff->AnalyzePlayerBehavior(player);

      // Use scale to adjust encounter difficulty dynamically

      player->SetDifficultyScale(scale);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Encounter Scaling
    code: "void ApplyAdaptiveScaling(Player* player) {\n    AdaptiveDifficulty* diff\
      \ = sWorld->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();\n    float behaviorScore = diff->AnalyzePlayerBehavior(player);\n\
      \    \n    // Adjust difficulty based on player performance\n    if (behaviorScore\
      \ > 1.2f) {\n        // Player is performing well, increase difficulty\n   \
      \     player->SetEncounterDifficulty(ENCOUNTER_DIFFICULTY_HARD);\n    } else\
      \ if (behaviorScore < 0.8f) {\n        // Player is struggling, reduce difficulty\n\
      \        player->SetEncounterDifficulty(ENCOUNTER_DIFFICULTY_EASY);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs real-time analysis of player actions during encounters
    and may have performance implications when called frequently. The analysis includes
    tracking combat statistics, survival metrics, and resource usage patterns. Results
    are cached internally to prevent redundant computations during a single encounter
    session.
  warnings: The method assumes the player is currently engaged in an active encounter
    or has recently completed one. Calling this method on players not in combat may
    return inaccurate results. The returned scaling factor should be used carefully
    to avoid creating overly difficult or trivial experiences for players.
