  class: EnergyChiResourceWindwalker
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 EnergyChiResourceWindwalker::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum energy or chi value for a Windwalker class player.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the maximum allowable energy or chi value
    that a Windwalker class player can possess. This value is typically used in conjunction
    with the EnergyChiResourceWindwalker class to manage resource allocation, cooldowns,
    and special ability usage within the Windwalker monk's gameplay mechanics. The
    returned value represents the upper bound of the resource bar for this specific
    class specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum energy or chi points that a Windwalker
    player can have at any given time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 maxEnergy = windwalkerResource->GetMax();

      // Use maxEnergy to calculate resource percentages or display UI elements'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management Example
    code: 'EnergyChiResourceWindwalker* resource = player->GetEnergyChiResource();

      uint32 max = resource->GetMax();

      uint32 current = resource->GetCurrent();

      float percentage = (float)current / max * 100.0f;

      // Use percentage for UI display or gameplay logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during resource updates, UI rendering, or
    when calculating the effectiveness of abilities that consume energy or chi. The
    value returned may vary based on player level, equipment, and buffs/debuffs affecting
    the Windwalker's resource pool.
