  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::IsUseful(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the target assist action is useful for the bot AI.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if the target assist action should be
    considered for execution by the bot's AI. This typically involves checking conditions
    such as whether a valid target exists, if the bot is in a suitable state to perform
    the action, and if the action aligns with current combat or non-combat scenarios.
    The method is part of the AI decision-making process and helps determine the priority
    and applicability of the target assist behavior within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target assist action is deemed useful and should be
    executed; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (action.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    // Execute target assist behavior\n   \
      \ ai->ExecuteAction(action);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used within the context of bot AI decision trees
    to filter out actions that are not currently applicable. It may consider factors
    like target validity, bot health, and combat state.
