  class: CreatureTextMgr
  method: LoadCreatureTexts
  signature: void CreatureTextMgr::LoadCreatureTexts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all creature text entries from the database into memory for use in
    World of Warcraft NPCs.
  description: The LoadCreatureTexts method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the CreatureTextMgr class with all available creature text
    entries stored in the database. This method is typically called during server
    startup or when reloading creature texts dynamically. It retrieves text data associated
    with specific creatures, including their texts, sounds, emotes, and broadcasts,
    and organizes them for efficient retrieval during NPC interactions. The method
    ensures that all creature texts are properly indexed and ready for use by the
    game's AI and dialogue systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeCreatureTexts()\n{\n    sCreatureTextMgr->LoadCreatureTexts();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a full reload of creature texts is required. It performs database queries and
    memory allocations, so calling it frequently may impact performance. The method
    assumes that the database connection is already established and that the relevant
    tables contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in the internal text storage. Ensure that no
    active creature AI or dialogue systems are using the texts during the load process,
    as this could cause race conditions or inconsistent behavior.
