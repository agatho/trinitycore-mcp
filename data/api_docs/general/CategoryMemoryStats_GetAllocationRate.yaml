  method: GetAllocationRate
  signature: double CategoryMemoryStats::GetAllocationRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the memory allocation rate for the category in bytes
    per second.
  description: The GetAllocationRate method computes the average rate at which memory
    is being allocated within a specific memory category over time. This value represents
    how quickly memory usage is increasing for the given category, typically measured
    in bytes per second. The method is commonly used for monitoring memory performance
    and identifying potential memory leaks or excessive allocations during runtime.
    It may utilize internal timing mechanisms to determine the rate over a recent
    sampling period.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the memory allocation rate in bytes per second.
    A return value of zero indicates no recent allocation activity, while positive
    values indicate ongoing memory growth within the category.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Memory Allocation
    code: "CategoryMemoryStats stats;\n// Assume stats has been populated with memory\
      \ data\nconst double rate = stats.GetAllocationRate();\nif (rate > 1024.0) {\n\
      \    // Log high allocation rate\n    printf(\"High memory allocation rate detected:\
      \ %.2f bytes/sec\\n\", rate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal timestamps and previous memory measurements
    to calculate the rate. It should be called periodically for accurate results,
    as instantaneous values may not reflect true allocation trends.
