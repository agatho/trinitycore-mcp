documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates a spatial grid for the specified map
  description: The CreateGrid method is responsible for setting up the spatial grid
    system for a given Map instance. This method typically initializes internal data
    structures that enable efficient object tracking and spatial queries within the
    game world. It is commonly invoked during map loading or initialization phases
    to ensure that the spatial grid is properly configured for the specific map's
    dimensions and requirements. The method handles allocation and setup of grid cells,
    ensuring that objects can be efficiently located and managed based on their positions
    in the 3D space.

  - title: Basic Grid Creation
    code: 'Map* myMap = sMapMgr->CreateMap(0, nullptr);

      SpatialGridManager::CreateGrid(myMap);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the Map object has been properly
    initialized and configured. The spatial grid creation process may involve significant
    memory allocation and initialization overhead depending on the map's size and
    complexity.
