documentation:
  brief: Returns the time delay before a player's corpse can be reclaimed after death.
  description: This method retrieves the corpse reclaim delay in seconds for the player,
    which determines how long the player must wait before their corpse can be reclaimed
    by other players. The delay is affected by PvP status and game mechanics such
    as the 'reclaim delay' that occurs when a player dies in PvP zones. This method
    is commonly used to determine the time window during which a player's corpse remains
    vulnerable to looting by other players, especially in PvP scenarios where players
    can be killed and their corpses remain in the world for a specific duration before
    being reclaimed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of seconds that must pass before a player's corpse can
    be reclaimed. This value is typically 300 seconds (5 minutes) for non-PvP players,
    but can vary based on game rules and PvP status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 delay = player->GetCorpseReclaimDelay();\nif (delay > 0)\n    printf(\"\
      Corpse reclaim delay: %d seconds\\n\", delay);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other PvP-related mechanics
    and may be affected by server settings or game rules. The delay value can vary
    depending on whether the player is in a PvP zone or not, and may also depend on
    the player's level or faction.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player is eligible for
    corpse reclaiming, as it only returns the delay time and does not account for
    other factors such as player death state or game mechanics. Also, this method
    may return zero in some cases depending on server configuration.
