  method: ~ScopedProfiler
  signature: void ScopedProfiler::~ScopedProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ScopedProfiler instance and records profiling data.
  description: The ~ScopedProfiler destructor is automatically called when a ScopedProfiler
    object goes out of scope. It finalizes the profiling measurement for the associated
    code block, calculates the elapsed time, and logs the profiling information. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with the ScopedProfiler constructor to
    automatically profile code sections without manual start/stop calls. The profiler
    records timing data that can be used for performance analysis and optimization
    within the TrinityCore server environment.

  - title: Basic Usage of ScopedProfiler
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    // Automatically starts profiling\n    ScopedProfiler\
      \ profiler;\n    \n    // Code to be profiled\n    DoSomeWork();\n    \n   \
      \ // Destructor automatically called here, logs profiling data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when the ScopedProfiler object goes out
    of scope. It's important to ensure that the profiler object is properly scoped
    to capture the intended code section. The profiling data is typically logged using
    TrinityCore's logging system and can be viewed in server logs or performance monitoring
    tools.
