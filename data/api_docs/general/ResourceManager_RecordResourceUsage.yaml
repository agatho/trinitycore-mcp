  class: ResourceManager
  method: RecordResourceUsage
  signature: void ResourceManager::RecordResourceUsage(ResourceType type, uint32 amount,
    uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records resource usage for a specified resource type, amount, and spell ID.
  description: The RecordResourceUsage method logs information about resource consumption
    within the TrinityCore framework. It tracks how much of a specific resource type
    is used by a particular spell, which is essential for managing player abilities,
    cooldowns, and resource management systems such as mana, rage, energy, or focus.
    This method likely updates internal tracking structures or databases to maintain
    accurate resource usage statistics for gameplay mechanics and potential debugging
    purposes. The method does not return any value but serves as a data recording
    mechanism that supports the core game logic related to resource consumption.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of resource being consumed (e.g., mana, rage,
      energy). This parameter determines which resource tracking system is updated.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource that was consumed. Must be
      a non-negative integer representing the amount used.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that triggered the resource consumption.
      Used to associate resource usage with specific abilities or spells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Record mana usage for a fireball spell
    code: 'resourceManager->RecordResourceUsage(ResourceType::MANA, 50, 133);

      // Records that 50 mana was consumed by the Fireball spell (ID: 133)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Log energy expenditure for a rogue ability
    code: 'resourceManager->RecordResourceUsage(ResourceType::ENERGY, 25, 1757);

      // Logs that 25 energy was consumed by the Sinister Strike ability (ID: 1757)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game engine to maintain accurate
    resource tracking for player actions. It may be called during spell casting or
    ability activation events. Developers should ensure that the values passed for
    'type' and 'spellId' are valid within the context of the TrinityCore resource
    system.
  warnings: Incorrect resource type values could lead to invalid tracking entries.
    Ensure that the spell ID corresponds to an actual spell in the database to maintain
    data integrity.
