documentation:
  brief: Moves an OutdoorPvPMgr instance to another, transferring ownership of its
    resources.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on the OutdoorPvPMgr
    class, transferring all managed resources from the source object to the target
    object. This is typically used in scenarios where an OutdoorPvPMgr object needs
    to be reassigned or replaced with another instance's contents without copying
    data. The operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state.
    In the context of TrinityCore's outdoor PvP system, this method supports efficient
    resource management when handling multiple OutdoorPvP zones or transitioning between
    different OutdoorPvP configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target OutdoorPvPMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Move Assignment Example
    code: 'OutdoorPvPMgr manager1;

      OutdoorPvPMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should be
    used carefully to avoid dangling references. The moved-from object must not be
    accessed after the operation unless it's reassigned.
