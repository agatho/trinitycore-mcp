  class: PlayerbotDatabaseManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PlayerbotDatabaseManager::Initialize(const std::string & connectionInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the playerbot database connection using the provided connection
    information.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the database connection for the Playerbot
    system by establishing a link to the specified database using the provided connection
    string. This method is typically called during server startup or when the playerbot
    system needs to access persistent data such as bot configurations, behavior patterns,
    or saved player preferences. It ensures that all subsequent database operations
    within the PlayerbotDatabaseManager can successfully communicate with the underlying
    database engine. The method performs validation on the connection information
    and handles any necessary initialization routines required for the database interface
    to function properly.
  parameters:
  - name: connectionInfo
    description: A string containing the database connection parameters including
      host, port, username, password, and database name. Format typically follows
      standard database connection strings such as 'host=localhost;port=3306;user=root;password=mypassword;dbname=trinitycore_playerbots'
  returns: Returns true if the database connection was successfully established and
    initialized, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the connection
    failed due to invalid parameters, network issues, or database server unavailability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Initialization
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseManager dbManager;\nstd::string connInfo = \"host=localhost;port=3306;user=trinity;password=trinity;dbname=trinitycore_playerbots\"\
      ;\nbool success = dbManager.Initialize(connInfo);\nif (success) {\n    // Database\
      \ is ready for use\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Playerbot database initialized\
      \ successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      playerbot\", \"Failed to initialize playerbot database\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseManager dbManager;\nstd::string connInfo = \"host=127.0.0.1;port=3306;user=root;password=secret;dbname=playerbots_db\"\
      ;\n\ntry {\n    if (!dbManager.Initialize(connInfo)) {\n        throw std::runtime_error(\"\
      Database initialization failed\");\n    }\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Playerbot system ready for operation\");\n} catch\
      \ (const std::exception& e) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Playerbot database\
      \ error: {}\", e.what());\n    // Handle critical failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a PlayerbotDatabaseManager
    instance. Subsequent calls to Initialize will likely fail or have undefined behavior.
    The connection string format is crucial for successful initialization, and malformed
    strings will result in connection failures. This method may block during network
    connection establishment and database authentication.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously as it may
    cause race conditions in the database connection setup. Ensure that the connection
    information provided is secure and does not expose sensitive credentials. If initialization
    fails, the PlayerbotDatabaseManager instance should not be used for database operations
    until a successful re-initialization occurs.
