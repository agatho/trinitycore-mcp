  class: GuildBankManager
  method: IdentifyUnusedItems
  signature: int GuildBankManager::IdentifyUnusedItems(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Identifies and returns the count of unused items in the guild bank.
  description: The IdentifyUnusedItems method scans the guild bank inventory to determine
    how many items are not currently being used by any guild members. It evaluates
    item usage based on the guild's banking rules and member activity. This method
    is typically used for maintenance purposes, such as identifying obsolete or redundant
    items that can be removed from the guild bank to free up space or reduce clutter.
    The method may also assist in optimizing guild resource management by highlighting
    items that have not been accessed recently.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      is used to specify which guild's bank inventory should be analyzed for unused
      items.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of unused items found in
    the specified guild's bank. A return value of zero indicates that all items are
    currently in use or have been recently accessed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nint unusedCount = guildBankManager->IdentifyUnusedItems(&guildId);\n\
      if (unusedCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d unused items in guild bank\\n\"\
      , unusedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform a full scan of the guild bank inventory, which could
    be resource-intensive for large guilds with extensive item collections. It is
    recommended to call this function during low-traffic periods or as part of scheduled
    maintenance tasks.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided guild identifier is valid and corresponds to
    an existing guild; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or cause
    undefined behavior. This function does not modify any data but only analyzes item
    usage statistics.
