  class: WarlockAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void WarlockAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes resource associated with a spell for the warlock AI.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the required
    resources (such as soul shards, mana, or other warlock-specific consumables) from
    the warlock's current resource pool when a specific spell is cast. This method
    ensures that the AI respects the game's resource management system and prevents
    casting spells without sufficient resources. It typically interacts with the warlock's
    internal resource tracking mechanisms to update the available resources after
    consumption.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This ID determines
      which resources are consumed based on the spell's requirements defined in the
      game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyWarlockAI::OnSpellCast(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    // Consume resources\
      \ before casting\n    ConsumeResource(spellId);\n    // Proceed with spell logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Consumption
    code: "void WarlockAI::CastSpellIfHasResources(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    if (HasSufficientResources(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        DoCast(spellId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system before executing
    a spell. It assumes that the spell ID provided corresponds to a valid warlock
    spell with defined resource costs in the game's database. The actual resource
    deduction logic may vary depending on the specific spell and warlock specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    warlock spell, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method should not
    be called directly without verifying that the warlock has sufficient resources
    for the spell.
