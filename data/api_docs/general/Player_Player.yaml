documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Player instance with the provided session data
  description: The Player constructor initializes a new player character object using
    the provided WorldSession. This method sets up the basic player structure, including
    session references, initial state variables, and prepares the player for gameplay.
    The constructor is typically called during player login when a new player object
    needs to be created from session data. It handles essential setup tasks such as
    initializing player statistics, setting up the player's session reference, and
    preparing internal data structures needed for character management within the
    TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Construction
    code: 'WorldSession* session = new WorldSession(1, "Player1");

      Player* player = new Player(session);

      // Player object is now initialized with the session data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during player login process. Developers should not call this constructor directly
    unless implementing custom player creation logic. The session parameter must be
    a valid WorldSession object that has been properly initialized.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of Player objects using this constructor should be
    avoided in most cases as it bypasses normal player creation procedures. Improper
    use can lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks if session management is not
    handled correctly.
