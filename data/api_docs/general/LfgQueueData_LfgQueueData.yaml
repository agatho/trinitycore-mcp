  class: LfgQueueData
  method: LfgQueueData
  signature: void LfgQueueData::LfgQueueData(time_t _joinTime, const LfgDungeonSet
    & _dungeons, const LfgRolesMap & _roles)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgQueueData object with join time, selected dungeons,
    and player roles.
  description: The LfgQueueData constructor initializes a data structure used to track
    player participation in the Looking for Group (LFG) system. It stores essential
    information about when a player joined a queue, which dungeons they are interested
    in, and their role preferences. This data is crucial for matching players with
    suitable groups based on dungeon requirements and role availability. The constructor
    sets up internal state that will be used by the LFG subsystem to manage group
    formation and queue processing.
  parameters:
  - name: _joinTime
    description: The timestamp when the player joined the LFG queue, represented as
      a time_t value
  - name: _dungeons
    description: A set of dungeon IDs that the player has selected for potential group
      matching
  - name: _roles
    description: A map containing role preferences for the player, mapping player
      GUIDs to their LFG roles
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic LfgQueueData Initialization
    code: 'LfgDungeonSet dungeons;

      dungeons.insert(123);

      dungeons.insert(124);

      LfgRolesMap roles;

      roles[123456] = LFG_ROLE_TANK;

      time_t joinTime = time(nullptr);

      LfgQueueData queueData(joinTime, dungeons, roles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the LFG system when a
    player submits their queue request. The dungeon set and role map are copied during
    initialization, so modifications to the original containers after construction
    will not affect the stored data.
