  class: GroupEventHandler
  method: SetBotAI
  signature: void GroupEventHandler::SetBotAI(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a BotAI instance to the group event handler for managing bot behavior.
  description: The SetBotAI method configures the GroupEventHandler with a specific
    BotAI instance, enabling the handler to control and manage bot AI behaviors within
    a group context. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's bot system to
    associate AI logic with group events, allowing bots to respond appropriately to
    group actions such as movement, combat, or quest completion. The assigned BotAI
    instance will be utilized by the event handler during group operations to determine
    bot behavior and decision-making. This method does not validate whether the provided
    BotAI pointer is valid; it simply stores the reference.
  parameters:
  - name: botAI
    description: Pointer to a BotAI instance that will be assigned to this GroupEventHandler.
      The BotAI object contains the logic and behavior definitions for controlling
      bot actions within group scenarios.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotAI Assignment
    code: 'BotAI* myBotAI = new BotAI();

      GroupEventHandler* handler = new GroupEventHandler();

      handler->SetBotAI(myBotAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a simple assignment of the BotAI pointer. It is the caller's
    responsibility to ensure that the BotAI object remains valid for the duration
    of its use by the GroupEventHandler. No memory management or reference counting
    is performed internally.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in undefined behavior
    if the event handler attempts to use the assigned BotAI. Always validate the BotAI
    instance before calling SetBotAI.
