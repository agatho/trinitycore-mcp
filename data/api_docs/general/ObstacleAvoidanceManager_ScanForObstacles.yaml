  method: ScanForObstacles
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ScanForObstacles(const DetectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Scans the environment for obstacles in the specified detection context and
    returns a count of detected obstacles.
  description: The ScanForObstacles method performs an environmental scan to detect
    obstacles within a given DetectionContext. It evaluates the current position,
    orientation, and surrounding terrain to identify potential barriers that could
    impede movement or pathfinding. The method is typically used in AI behavior systems
    to prevent units from walking into walls, furniture, or other impassable objects.
    This function may be called periodically during AI updates or when initiating
    movement actions to ensure safe navigation. The scan considers various obstacle
    types including static geometry, dynamic objects, and environmental features.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of obstacles detected in the
    current scan. A value of zero indicates no obstacles were found within the detection
    range. Negative values may indicate errors or invalid context parameters during
    the scanning process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle scan usage
    code: "DetectionContext context;\ncontext.position = unit->GetPosition();\ncontext.radius\
      \ = 5.0f;\ncontext.maxDistance = 20.0f;\nint obstacleCount = obstacleManager->ScanForObstacles(context);\n\
      if (obstacleCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle obstacle avoidance logic\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should not be called excessively
    during high-frequency AI updates. The detection context parameters significantly
    affect both accuracy and performance of the scan operation. Consider caching or
    batching obstacle scans for multiple units to improve efficiency.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating error conditions when
    the provided DetectionContext contains invalid parameters such as negative radius
    or distance values. Ensure that all context parameters are properly validated
    before calling this method.
