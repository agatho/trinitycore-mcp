  class: GroupCoordination
  method: UpdateFormation
  signature: void GroupCoordination::UpdateFormation(const int & leaderPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of a group based on the leader's current position.
  description: The UpdateFormation method recalculates and applies the group's tactical
    formation in response to the leader's updated position. This method is typically
    invoked when a group leader moves or changes their positioning within a raid or
    party context. It ensures that all group members adjust their relative positions
    according to the defined formation rules, maintaining proper spacing and alignment
    for optimal combat effectiveness or movement coordination.
  parameters:
  - name: leaderPosition
    description: The new position of the group leader as an integer coordinate value.
      This parameter determines how the formation is recalculated and applied to all
      group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Update
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coordination = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coordination->UpdateFormation(5); // Updates formation with leader at position
      5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Adjustment
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    GroupCoordination* coordination = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      \    int newLeaderPos = GetOptimalFormationPosition(player);\n    coordination->UpdateFormation(newLeaderPos);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raids,
    dungeons, or battlegrounds where coordinated positioning is important. The formation
    logic may vary depending on the specific group type (raid vs. party) and current
    game context.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid group context may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the leader position value passed is within expected bounds
    to avoid invalid formation states.
