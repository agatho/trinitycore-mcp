  class: QuestPickup
  method: ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the group coordination strategy for a bot player during quest pickup.
  description: The ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy method handles the logic required
    when a bot player picks up a quest in a group setting. It ensures proper coordination
    with the group members, such as synchronizing quest acceptance, managing quest-related
    rewards, and handling any group-specific quest mechanics. This method is typically
    invoked during quest pickup events to maintain consistency within the group's
    quest progress. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    related to group quest management.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is picking
      up the quest. This player must be part of a group for the coordination strategy
      to have an effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest pickup handler
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (player->IsBot())\n\
      \    {\n        QuestPickup questPickup;\n        questPickup.ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already in a group. If the player
    is not in a group, the method will perform no group-specific actions but still
    completes its internal processing. The method may interact with group loot settings
    and quest reward distribution if applicable.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed to this method is valid and represents
    an active bot before calling. Calling this method on a non-bot player or a null
    pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
