  class: PriestAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool PriestAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the priest has sufficient resource (mana, holy power, etc.) to
    cast a specified spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the PriestAI instance
    has adequate resources to cast a given spell. This method is typically used during
    AI decision-making processes to determine spell viability before attempting to
    cast. It considers the current resource state of the priest (such as mana, holy
    power, or other relevant resources) and compares it against the resource requirements
    of the specified spell. The method returns true if sufficient resources are available,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for intelligent spell selection
    in AI-controlled priest characters within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to entries in the Spell.dbc database file and must
      reference a valid spell that the priest can potentially cast.
  returns: Returns true if the priest has sufficient resources to cast the specified
    spell, false otherwise. The method does not account for temporary resource changes
    or effects that might alter resource availability during spell execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (priestAI->HasEnoughResource(47540)) {\n    // Cast Divine Spirit\n\
      \    priestAI->CastSpell(47540);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 0;\nif (HasEnoughResource(15286))\n    spellToCast\
      \ = 15286; // Shadow Word: Pain\nelse if (HasEnoughResource(14747))\n    spellToCast\
      \ = 14747; // Devouring Plague\nif (spellToCast)\n    priestAI->CastSpell(spellToCast);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's internal resource tracking system
    and may be affected by spell cooldowns or temporary resource modifiers. It should
    be called before attempting to cast a spell to avoid failed casts due to insufficient
    resources.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant resource types are properly initialized
    for the priest instance. If resource tracking is not correctly implemented, this
    method might return incorrect results. Additionally, it does not consider external
    effects like buffs or debuffs that could temporarily alter resource costs.
