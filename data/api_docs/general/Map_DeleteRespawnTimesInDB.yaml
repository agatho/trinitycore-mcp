  signature: void Map::DeleteRespawnTimesInDB()
documentation:
  brief: Deletes all respawn times for game objects and creatures in the database
    for this map.
  description: The DeleteRespawnTimesInDB method removes all stored respawn time entries
    from the database for the current map instance. This operation is typically used
    during map loading or unloading processes to ensure that stale respawn data does
    not persist when the map is reset or reinitialized. The method operates directly
    on the database layer and affects all game objects and creatures associated with
    the map's respawn system. It is commonly invoked when a map is being refreshed,
    cleared, or when transitioning between different game states where existing respawn
    timers are no longer valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deleting respawn times during map unload
    code: "void Map::UnloadMap()\n{\n    // ... other unloading logic ...\n    DeleteRespawnTimesInDB();\n\
      \    // ... continue with unload process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should be called only
    when it's safe to modify persistent data. It is typically invoked during map lifecycle
    management operations such as loading, unloading, or resetting a map instance.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method as it permanently removes
    respawn time data from the database. This action cannot be undone without restoring
    from backup and may affect game state consistency if called at inappropriate times.
