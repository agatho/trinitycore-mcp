  method: MaintainCatForm
  signature: void FeralDruidRefactored::MaintainCatForm()
documentation:
  brief: Maintains the cat form state for a feral druid player character.
  description: The MaintainCatForm method ensures that a feral druid remains in cat
    form by checking and applying necessary mechanics such as stance switching, aura
    management, and resource conservation. This method is typically invoked during
    AI decision-making processes to maintain optimal combat performance while in cat
    form. It handles transitions between cat form and other forms, manages the druid's
    energy or rage resources, and ensures that required buffs and debuffs are properly
    applied or maintained. The method may also handle special abilities like Shadowmeld
    or stealth mechanics that are specific to feral druid gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    _druid.MaintainCatForm();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with conditional form maintenance
    code: "void FeralDruidRefactored::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    if (GetShapeshiftForm()\
      \ != FORM_CAT)\n        return;\n    \n    MaintainCatForm();\n    // Additional\
      \ combat initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core feral druid AI implementation and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. It assumes that the druid is already
    in cat form or capable of entering it. The implementation may involve checking
    for conflicting auras, managing cooldowns, and ensuring proper resource allocation
    for abilities like Shred, Rake, and Ferocious Bite.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or when the druid is not in cat
    form may result in unexpected behavior or performance issues. Ensure that proper
    checks are performed before invoking this method to avoid unnecessary processing.
