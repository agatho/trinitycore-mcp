  class: LevelBracket
  method: GetSelectionPriority
  signature: float LevelBracket::GetSelectionPriority(uint32 totalBots) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the selection priority value for a level bracket based
    on total bot count.
  description: The GetSelectionPriority method computes a floating-point priority
    value used by the game's matchmaking or balancing system to determine how likely
    a particular level bracket is to be selected for player matching. This value typically
    influences queue behavior, ensuring balanced gameplay across different player
    levels. The calculation takes into account the total number of bots currently
    in the system, which may affect how priorities are weighted. This method is part
    of the LevelBracket class and is intended to be called during matchmaking logic
    or bracket selection processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the computed selection priority for this level
    bracket. Higher values indicate higher priority for selection in matchmaking scenarios.
    The exact range and meaning depend on internal balancing logic but generally reflects
    relative desirability or suitability of the bracket for matching.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Matchmaking
    code: "LevelBracket bracket;\nfloat priority = bracket.GetSelectionPriority(100);\n\
      // Use 'priority' to influence queue selection logic\nif (priority > 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Consider this bracket more suitable for active matching\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's battleground or arena
    matchmaking systems. It may be called multiple times during a single matchmaking
    cycle, so performance should be considered if the implementation involves complex
    calculations or external lookups.
