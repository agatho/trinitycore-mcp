documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry supports instance creation and can be used
    for dungeon or raid encounters.
  description: The Instanceable() method checks if a MapEntry object represents a
    map type that is capable of being instantiated as a dungeon, raid, or other player-versus-environment
    content. This flag is essential for determining which maps can be entered by players
    in a persistent instance context, such as when creating or joining a group for
    a specific dungeon encounter. The method returns true if the map supports instancing,
    and false otherwise. Maps that are not instanceable typically include world maps
    or areas that do not have a defined instance structure. This check is commonly
    used during player entry validation and instance creation logic within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry supports instancing (i.e., can be created
    as an instance for player encounters), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry is Instanceable
    code: "if (mapEntry->Instanceable()) {\n    // Proceed with instance creation\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Map %u is instanceable.\", mapEntry->ID);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle non-instanceable maps\n    sLog->outString(\"Map %u\
      \ is not instanceable.\", mapEntry->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map flags defined in the database or hardcoded
    values within the core. It's important to note that even if a map is marked as
    instanceable, additional checks may be required for actual instance creation,
    such as player level requirements or group size validation.
