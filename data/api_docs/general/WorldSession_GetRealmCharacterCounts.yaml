  class: WorldSession
  method: GetRealmCharacterCounts
  signature: const int & WorldSession::GetRealmCharacterCounts() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the character count for the current realm associated
    with this session.
  description: The GetRealmCharacterCounts method retrieves the number of characters
    currently existing on the realm that is associated with the WorldSession. This
    value represents how many players are registered on the realm and is used internally
    by the server for various operations such as realm population tracking, player
    limit enforcement, and UI updates in the character selection screen. The returned
    reference points to an internal integer member variable of the WorldSession class,
    which is updated periodically or upon specific events like character creation/deletion.
    This method does not perform any computation or I/O operations; it simply returns
    a cached value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the total number of characters
    on the realm associated with this session. The value is updated by the server
    and reflects the current state of the realm's character database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use realm character count
    code: "int characterCount = session->GetRealmCharacterCounts();\nif (characterCount\
      \ >= MAX_REALM_CHARACTERS) {\n    // Handle realm full logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal cached value. It is safe to
    use in performance-critical code paths as it avoids copying data. However, the
    value may not be immediately synchronized with real-time changes unless updated
    by server logic.
  warnings: Because this returns a const reference to an internal member, modifying
    the returned value through the reference will result in undefined behavior. Also,
    the character count may not reflect immediate changes if the session's realm data
    has not been refreshed recently.
