  class: TankPositionStrategy
  method: PositionForCleave
  signature: void TankPositionStrategy::PositionForCleave(Player * bot, int enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and sets the optimal position for a tank to perform a cleave attack
    based on enemy distribution.
  description: The PositionForCleave method determines the best location for a tank
    player to stand when executing a cleave ability. This strategy considers the number
    of enemies surrounding the tank to optimize positioning for maximum damage efficiency
    and threat generation. The method adjusts the bot's position relative to its target
    and nearby enemies, ensuring that the cleave spell hits as many targets as possible
    while maintaining proper aggro distribution. It is typically used in AI-driven
    bot behavior to enhance combat effectiveness during group encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the tank bot that will
      perform the cleave. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      player instance with appropriate combat capabilities.
  - name: enemies
    description: Integer value indicating the number of enemies currently in the tank's
      vicinity. This determines how the positioning logic calculates optimal cleave
      range and direction to maximize enemy coverage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for a tank bot performing cleave
    code: 'Player* myTank = ...; // Assume initialized tank player

      int numEnemies = 3;

      myTank->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle();

      TankPositionStrategy strategy;

      strategy.PositionForCleave(myTank, numEnemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cleave positioning in a dynamic combat scenario
    code: "void ExecuteCleave(Player* tank, std::vector<Unit*> targets) {\n    TankPositionStrategy\
      \ strategy;\n    strategy.PositionForCleave(tank, static_cast<int>(targets.size()));\n\
      \    // Proceed with cleave spell execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current target and surrounding enemy positions
    to calculate an effective cleave area. The positioning logic may vary depending
    on the specific implementation of TankPositionStrategy within the TrinityCore
    AI framework. It assumes that the bot has sufficient movement capabilities and
    is not in a state where movement is restricted.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter points to a valid Player object before
    calling this method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, this method modifies the bot's position directly, which may interfere
    with other ongoing movement or combat behaviors if not properly synchronized.
