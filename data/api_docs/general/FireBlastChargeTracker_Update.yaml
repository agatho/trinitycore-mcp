  class: FireBlastChargeTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FireBlastChargeTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the fire blast charge state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in FireBlastChargeTracker is responsible for managing
    and refreshing the fire blast charge status of a player bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically handles cooldown tracking, charge accumulation,
    and synchronization of the fire blast ability state with the game's internal systems.
    It ensures that the bot's fire blast charges are properly maintained according
    to game mechanics and player actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose fire blast
      charges need to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid player instance within the game world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'FireBlastChargeTracker tracker;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Valid player pointer

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle to ensure
    that fire blast charges are accurately tracked and managed. The implementation
    may involve checking for cooldown expiration, updating charge counts, and potentially
    triggering events or actions based on charge state changes.
