  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: EnableSmartPathing
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::EnableSmartPathing(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables smart pathing behavior for the leader-follower AI system.
  description: The EnableSmartPathing method controls whether the LeaderFollowBehavior
    uses advanced pathfinding algorithms to navigate around obstacles and maintain
    formation. When enabled, the behavior will attempt to find optimal paths that
    avoid collisions with environment objects, other units, or terrain features while
    keeping the follower within a specified distance of the leader. This functionality
    is particularly useful in group scenarios where units need to follow complex movement
    patterns without getting stuck or overlapping. The method does not validate the
    current state of the AI system and will immediately apply the setting regardless
    of whether the behavior is currently active.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines if smart pathing should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false). When true, the AI will use advanced pathfinding; when false,
      it will use basic movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Smart Pathing for a Follower
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->EnableSmartPathing(true);

      // The follower will now use smart pathfinding to navigate around obstacles.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Toggle Smart Pathing Based on Game State
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    behavior->EnableSmartPathing(false);\n\
      } else {\n    behavior->EnableSmartPathing(true);\n}\n// Disable smart pathing\
      \ during combat for performance reasons."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the pathfinding behavior of the LeaderFollowBehavior
    instance. It does not influence other AI components or movement systems in TrinityCore.
    The setting persists until explicitly changed by another call to EnableSmartPathing,
    even if the behavior is temporarily suspended.
  warnings: Disabling smart pathing may cause followers to become stuck on obstacles
    or fail to maintain proper formation during complex movements. This can be particularly
    problematic in high-traffic areas or when following leaders through narrow passages.
