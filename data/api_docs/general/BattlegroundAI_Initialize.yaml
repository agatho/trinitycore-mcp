documentation:
  brief: Initializes the battleground AI system with required data and configurations.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state of the BattlegroundAI
    class, preparing it for managing battleground activities. This includes initializing
    various AI-related variables, setting up event handlers, and configuring the battleground's
    strategic elements such as objectives, spawn points, and team assignments. The
    method is typically called during battleground creation or when a new instance
    is started to ensure that all AI components are properly configured before gameplay
    begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();

      bgAI->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per battleground instance during initialization.
    It is not intended to be called repeatedly during gameplay as it may reset important
    AI state information.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same BattlegroundAI instance
    can lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that this method is invoked
    only during proper setup phases of the battleground lifecycle.
