  signature: CalendarInviteStore CalendarMgr::GetEventInvites(uint64 eventId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all calendar event invites associated with a specific event ID.
  description: The GetEventInvites method fetches a collection of calendar invites
    for a given event identifier. This function is used internally by the TrinityCore
    calendar system to retrieve invite data for display or processing. The returned
    CalendarInviteStore contains all invite records related to the specified event,
    including invite status, invitee information, and response times. This method
    does not modify any data but provides read-only access to the invite store for
    a particular calendar event.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CalendarInviteStore object containing all invites associated with the
    specified event ID. The store typically includes invite records with details such
    as invitee GUID, invite status (accepted, declined, tentative), and timestamp
    of response.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve invites for a calendar event
    code: "uint64 eventId = 12345;\nCalendarInviteStore invites = sCalendarMgr->GetEventInvites(eventId);\n\
      for (auto& invite : invites)\n{\n    printf(\"Invitee GUID: %llu, Status: %u\\\
      n\", invite->GetInviteeGuid(), invite->GetStatus());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar subsystem and assumes that the event
    ID provided exists in the database. The returned CalendarInviteStore should be
    treated as read-only. Performance is optimized for retrieving invites for a single
    event at a time.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event ID may result
    in an empty CalendarInviteStore, but could also potentially cause undefined behavior
    if not properly validated. Ensure that the event ID exists before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected results.
