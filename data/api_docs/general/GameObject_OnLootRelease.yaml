  brief: Handles loot release event for game objects, notifying when a player releases
    loot from a game object
  description: The OnLootRelease method is called when a player releases loot from
    a game object, typically during a loot event where the player has been granted
    the right to loot items. This method allows developers to hook into the loot release
    process and perform custom actions such as logging, modifying loot behavior, or
    triggering additional events. The method is part of the GameObject class and is
    invoked when a player releases loot from a game object, usually after a successful
    loot roll or when the player has been granted the right to loot items.

    code: "void GameObject::OnLootRelease(int* looter)\n{\n    // Custom logic here\n\
      \    // Example: log the loot release event\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %d\
      \ released loot from game object %d\", looter, GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during a loot event where players have been
    granted the right to loot items. It should be used carefully as it may be called
    multiple times per game object depending on how many players are involved in the
    loot process.
