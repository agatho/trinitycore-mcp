  class: InteractionManager
  method: FindNearestGameObject
  signature: GameObject * InteractionManager::FindNearestGameObject(Player * bot,
    uint32 entry, float maxRange) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds the nearest GameObject with the specified entry ID within the given
    range for a player bot.
  description: The FindNearestGameObject method searches for the closest GameObject
    in the world that matches the provided entry ID and is within the specified maximum
    range from the player bot. This method is commonly used by AI systems to locate
    interactable objects such as chests, doors, or quest items. It performs a spatial
    search using the game's internal object management system to efficiently determine
    proximity. The method returns a pointer to the GameObject if one is found within
    range; otherwise, it returns nullptr. This functionality is essential for bots
    to make decisions about which objects to interact with based on their current
    location and available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be used
      as the reference point for finding the nearest GameObject.
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the GameObject type to search
      for. This corresponds to the 'entry' field in the game's database tables such
      as gameobject_template.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which to search for the GameObject.
      Objects beyond this range will be ignored.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject instance that matches the entry ID
    and is closest to the bot within the specified range. If no matching GameObject
    is found within range, or if invalid parameters are provided, the method returns
    nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Find nearest treasure chest
    code: "GameObject* chest = interactionManager->FindNearestGameObject(bot, 1763,\
      \ 20.0f);\nif (chest)\n{\n    // Interact with the chest\n    bot->GetSession()->HandleGameObjectUseOpcode(chest->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Find nearest quest item
    code: "uint32 questItemEntry = 18754;\nGameObject* questObject = interactionManager->FindNearestGameObject(playerBot,\
      \ questItemEntry, 30.0f);\nif (questObject && questObject->GetGOInfo()->IsQuestGiver())\n\
      {\n    // Handle quest giver object\n    playerBot->GetSession()->HandleGameObjectUseOpcode(questObject->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the internal spatial indexing system of TrinityCore to optimize
    search performance. It is recommended to use reasonable range values to avoid
    unnecessary computation. The method does not perform any checks on the GameObject's
    current state or usability - it only finds the nearest matching object based on
    position and entry ID.
  warnings: Be cautious when using large maxRange values as this can impact performance,
    especially in densely populated areas. Always check for null return values before
    attempting to use the returned GameObject pointer to prevent crashes.
