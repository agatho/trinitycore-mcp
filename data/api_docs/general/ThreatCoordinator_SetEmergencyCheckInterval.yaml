  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetEmergencyCheckInterval
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetEmergencyCheckInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interval at which emergency threat checks are performed by the ThreatCoordinator.
  description: The SetEmergencyCheckInterval method configures how frequently the
    ThreatCoordinator performs emergency threat assessments. This interval determines
    the rate at which the system evaluates and responds to potential threat scenarios,
    particularly in combat situations where rapid threat assessment is critical. The
    method accepts a time interval in milliseconds, allowing fine-grained control
    over the responsiveness of the threat evaluation system. This setting directly
    impacts the system's ability to react quickly to changing combat conditions and
    maintain proper threat management for AI-controlled creatures or players.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between emergency threat checks.
      Valid values are positive integers representing time duration. Lower values
      increase responsiveness but may impact performance, while higher values reduce
      system load but may delay threat response times.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Emergency Check Interval
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetEmergencyCheckInterval(500); // Check every 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring High-Response Threat Coordinator
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetEmergencyCheckInterval(100); // Very fast response (100ms interval)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the performance characteristics of threat evaluation
    in combat scenarios. The interval should be tuned based on server load and desired
    responsiveness. Setting very low intervals may cause performance degradation during
    high-combat activity, while excessively high intervals might result in delayed
    threat responses.
  warnings: Modifying this interval during active combat situations may have immediate
    effects on threat management behavior. Extreme values (very low or very high)
    should be tested thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences in gameplay mechanics.
