documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all online guild members
  description: The BroadcastPacket method sends a specified WorldPacket to all currently
    online members of the guild. This method is typically used for broadcasting guild-related
    messages, updates, or notifications to all active guild members in real-time.
    The packet is transmitted directly to each member's client without any filtering
    or additional processing. This operation is synchronous and will block until all
    packets have been sent to connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be broadcasted
      to all online guild members. The packet should be properly constructed with
      appropriate opcode and data before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a Guild Chat Message
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_GUILD_CHAT, 100);

      packet << uint8(0); // Channel type

      packet << "Guild Master"; // Sender name

      packet << "Important announcement for all guild members!"; // Message

      guild->BroadcastPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast Guild Event Notification
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_GUILD_EVENT, 50);

      packet << uint32(GUILD_EVENT_TYPE::GUILD_EVENT_MEETING);

      packet << uint64(eventTime);

      packet << "Guild meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 7 PM";

      guild->BroadcastPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only sends packets to online guild members. Offline members will
    not receive the broadcast. The method does not perform any packet validation or
    error handling beyond sending the packet to connected clients. It's recommended
    to ensure the packet is properly constructed before calling this method to avoid
    client-side issues.
  warnings: Using this method with large packets may impact performance as it sends
    individual packets to each online member. Avoid broadcasting unnecessary data
    to prevent network overhead. The packet pointer must not be null or invalid, as
    this could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
