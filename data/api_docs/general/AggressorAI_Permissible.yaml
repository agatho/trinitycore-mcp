  class: AggressorAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int AggressorAI::Permissible(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if the AggressorAI can be assigned to a creature based on its
    type and behavior.
  description: 'The Permissible method is used by the TrinityCore AI system to evaluate
    whether a specific Creature instance should be assigned an AggressorAI. This method
    acts as a filter, determining compatibility between the AI type and the creature''s
    properties. The return value indicates how permissible it is for this AI to be
    used: a positive value means the AI is suitable, zero means it''s not suitable
    at all, and a negative value may indicate that another AI should be considered
    instead. This method is crucial for dynamic AI assignment in the game world where
    different creatures require different AI behaviors.'
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the permissibility level: positive values
    mean the AI is suitable for use, zero means it''s not suitable at all, and negative
    values may indicate that another AI should be considered instead. The exact meaning
    of specific positive or negative values depends on the AI system''s implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI assignment logic
    code: "int permissible = ai->Permissible(creature);\nif (permissible > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Assign AggressorAI to creature\n    creature->SetAI(new AggressorAI(creature));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or when a creature's
    AI needs to be reassigned. It's part of the broader AI system that allows for
    flexible and dynamic behavior assignment based on creature properties.
