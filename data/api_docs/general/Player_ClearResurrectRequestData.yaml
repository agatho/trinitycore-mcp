  brief: Clears all resurrection request data from the player's memory.
  description: This method removes all pending resurrection requests and related data
    from a player's memory, effectively resetting the resurrection state. It is typically
    used when a player cancels a resurrection request or when the player is no longer
    eligible for resurrection. The method ensures that any previously stored resurrection
    request information is cleared, allowing the player to receive new resurrection
    requests without conflicts.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ClearResurrectRequestData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal player state management system and should
    only be called when necessary. It does not directly interact with the game world
    or client, but rather clears internal data structures.
