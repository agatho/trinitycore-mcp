  method: RequestMovement
  signature: bool MovementArbiter::RequestMovement(MovementRequest && request)
documentation:
  brief: Requests movement for a unit based on the provided movement request parameters.
  description: The RequestMovement method is used by the MovementArbiter to process
    and initiate movement requests for units within the game world. It evaluates whether
    a given movement request can be fulfilled, considering factors such as unit state,
    pathfinding constraints, and current movement authority. The method returns true
    if the movement request was successfully queued or initiated, and false if it
    could not be processed due to invalid parameters, unit restrictions, or system
    limitations. This function is integral to the TrinityCore's movement handling
    system and integrates with the broader AI and navigation subsystems.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An rvalue reference to a MovementRequest object containing the details
      of the desired movement, including target position, movement type, speed, and
      any associated flags or constraints.
  returns: Returns true if the movement request was successfully accepted and queued
    for processing. Returns false if the request could not be processed due to invalid
    parameters, unit state restrictions, or other system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Request
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.targetPosition = Position(100.0f, 200.0f,\
      \ 300.0f);\nrequest.movementType = MovementType::RUN;\nrequest.speed = 4.5f;\n\
      bool success = arbiter.RequestMovement(std::move(request));\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Movement request accepted\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Movement Request with Flags
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.targetPosition = Position(500.0f, 600.0f,\
      \ 700.0f);\nrequest.movementType = MovementType::WALK;\nrequest.speed = 2.5f;\n\
      request.flags = MovementFlags::MOVEFLAG_WALKING | MovementFlags::MOVEFLAG_FLYING;\n\
      bool success = arbiter.RequestMovement(std::move(request));\nif (!success) {\n\
      \    // Handle failed movement request\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from AI systems or external modules that
    need to control unit movement. The MovementArbiter maintains internal state tracking
    of active movements and may reject requests if a unit is already in motion or
    in an invalid state. It's important to ensure the request parameters are valid
    before calling this function to avoid unnecessary rejections.
  warnings: Calling this method with malformed or invalid MovementRequest objects
    can result in silent failures or undefined behavior. Always validate movement
    targets and ensure units are in a suitable state for movement before submitting
    requests.
