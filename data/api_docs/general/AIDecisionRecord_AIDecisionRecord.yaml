  class: AIDecisionRecord
  method: AIDecisionRecord
  signature: void AIDecisionRecord::AIDecisionRecord(uint32_t guid, AIDecisionCategory
    cat, DecisionComplexity comp, const std::string & ctx)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AI decision record with the specified GUID, category, complexity,
    and context.
  description: The AIDecisionRecord constructor initializes a new AI decision record
    object using the provided parameters. This method is used to store information
    about an AI decision made by a creature or NPC in the game world. The GUID identifies
    the entity making the decision, the category defines the type of decision (e.g.,
    combat, movement, interaction), the complexity indicates how intricate the decision-making
    process was, and the context provides additional details about the circumstances
    surrounding the decision. This functionality is typically used for AI debugging,
    performance monitoring, and behavior analysis within TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the creature or NPC making the AI
      decision. Must be a valid object GUID from the game world.
  - name: cat
    description: The category of the AI decision, indicating the type of action or
      behavior being decided. Should be a value from the AIDecisionCategory enumeration.
  - name: comp
    description: The complexity level of the AI decision-making process. Should be
      a value from the DecisionComplexity enumeration representing how intricate the
      decision was.
  - name: ctx
    description: A string providing contextual information about the decision, such
      as environmental factors or conditions that influenced the choice.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Decision Record Creation
    code: AIDecisionRecord record(12345, AIDecisionCategory::Combat, DecisionComplexity::Medium,
      "Enemy within range");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an AI Decision for Movement
    code: 'uint32_t npcGuid = pCreature->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      AIDecisionRecord record(npcGuid, AIDecisionCategory::Movement, DecisionComplexity::High,
      "Pathfinding through obstacles");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the AI system and may be called
    during various AI decision points. The context string can be used for debugging
    purposes to understand why certain decisions were made. It's important to ensure
    that the GUID corresponds to a valid creature or NPC in the game world.
  warnings: The constructor does not validate that the GUID actually exists in the
    world. Using an invalid GUID may lead to issues when retrieving or logging the
    decision record later. Ensure the context string is appropriately sanitized if
    it contains user-generated content.
