documentation:
  brief: Initializes spline offsets for area trigger movement paths
  description: The InitSplineOffsets method configures the spline-based movement parameters
    for an area trigger, setting up the offset data that defines how the trigger will
    move through the world. This method is typically called during area trigger initialization
    or when updating movement patterns. It processes the provided offsets data and
    applies them to the area trigger's spline path calculation. The method supports
    overriding the default speed settings and can interpret speed values as time durations
    in seconds.
  parameters:
  - name: offsets
    description: Reference to an integer containing offset data for spline path calculation.
      This parameter likely represents a configuration value or index that determines
      how the spline points are offset from the base position.
  - name: overrideSpeed
    description: Integer value that overrides the default speed setting for the area
      trigger's movement. When non-zero, this value is used instead of the standard
      speed calculation.
  - name: speedIsTimeInSeconds
    description: Integer flag (typically 0 or 1) indicating whether the speed parameter
      should be interpreted as a time duration in seconds rather than a speed value.
      When set to 1, the overrideSpeed is treated as movement time rather than velocity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with default speed
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      int offsets = 5;

      int overrideSpeed = 0;

      int speedIsTimeInSeconds = 0;

      trigger->InitSplineOffsets(offsets, overrideSpeed, speedIsTimeInSeconds);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using override speed with time interpretation
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      int offsets = 10;

      int overrideSpeed = 3;

      int speedIsTimeInSeconds = 1;

      trigger->InitSplineOffsets(offsets, overrideSpeed, speedIsTimeInSeconds);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the area trigger's movement system and may
    be called internally by the TrinityCore framework during area trigger creation
    or when updating movement properties. The offsets parameter appears to control
    how spline points are positioned relative to the base location, which affects
    the visual path of the area trigger effect.
  warnings: Improper use of the overrideSpeed and speedIsTimeInSeconds parameters
    may result in unexpected movement behavior or incorrect timing for area trigger
    effects. Ensure that the offsets value is valid for the intended spline configuration.
