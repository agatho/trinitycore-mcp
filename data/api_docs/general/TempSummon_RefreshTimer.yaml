  class: TempSummon
  method: RefreshTimer
  signature: void TempSummon::RefreshTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the timer for a temporary summon, extending its duration before it
    is automatically removed.
  description: The RefreshTimer method resets the internal timer of a TempSummon object,
    effectively prolonging the duration for which the summoned creature will remain
    in the world. This is typically used when a temporary summon needs to be kept
    alive beyond its original expiration time, such as during combat or when the summon's
    purpose is extended. The method does not alter the summon's state or behavior,
    only its time-based removal mechanism. It is commonly invoked by AI systems or
    scripts that manage summoned creatures to prevent premature despawn.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Refreshing a Summon Timer in Combat
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (TempSummon* summon = GetSummon())\n\
      \    {\n        // Extend the summon's duration while in combat\n        summon->RefreshTimer();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal timer of the TempSummon, which
    is managed by the game's object lifecycle system. It should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended behavior such as infinite summons or memory leaks if not properly
    balanced with despawn logic.
  warnings: Calling RefreshTimer on a summon that has already been removed from the
    world will have no effect and may lead to unexpected behavior if the summon is
    later re-added to the world without proper initialization.
