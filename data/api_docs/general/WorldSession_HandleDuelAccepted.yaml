  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleDuelAccepted
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleDuelAccepted(int arbiterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a duel acceptance from another player, initializing the duel state
    and sending relevant updates to both participants.
  description: The HandleDuelAccepted method is invoked when a player accepts a duel
    challenge initiated by another player. This method validates the duel state, ensures
    both players are eligible for combat, and begins the duel process by sending necessary
    packets to update the duel status on both clients. It also handles cleanup of
    the arbiter (if applicable) and prepares the players for the start of the duel.
    The method is part of the WorldSession class and is typically called as a result
    of a client-side packet received from the player who accepted the duel.
  parameters:
  - name: arbiterGuid
    description: The GUID of the arbiter (referee) associated with the duel. If set
      to 0, no arbiter is involved in the duel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a duel acceptance handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDuelAccepted(int arbiterGuid)\n{\n    // Validate\
      \ that we are in a valid state to accept the duel\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process the duel acceptance\n    sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByLowGUID(GetPlayer()->GetDuelId())->HandleDuelAccepted(arbiterGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already initiated a duel request
    and is now accepting it. The arbiter GUID may be used to track referee-related
    actions or cleanup after the duel concludes.
