  class: Corpse
  method: SetPartyGUID
  signature: void Corpse::SetPartyGUID(int partyGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the party GUID associated with this corpse.
  description: The SetPartyGUID method assigns a party identifier to a Corpse object,
    linking it to a specific party in the game world. This is typically used during
    player death and corpse creation to associate the corpse with the player's current
    party. The method updates an internal member variable that stores the party GUID,
    which may be used for loot distribution, corpse visibility, or other party-related
    mechanics. This operation does not validate the GUID against existing parties
    or perform any server-side checks.
  parameters:
  - name: partyGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the party to associate with this
      corpse. This should be a valid party GUID from the game's internal system, typically
      representing the party leader's GUID or a dedicated party identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Party GUID on Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint64 partyGuid = player->GetGroup()->GetLeaderGUID();

      corpse->SetPartyGUID(partyGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state variable and does not trigger
    any additional game logic or events. It is typically called during corpse creation
    or when a player's party membership changes while their corpse exists.
