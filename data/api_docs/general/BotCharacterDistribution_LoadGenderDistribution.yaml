documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the gender distribution data for bot characters within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The LoadGenderDistribution method is responsible for loading predefined
    gender distribution statistics for bot characters from configuration files or
    database sources. This method ensures that when bot characters are created, they
    adhere to specified gender ratios, which can be used for balancing gameplay mechanics
    or simulating realistic player populations. The method typically executes during
    server initialization or when the bot system is enabled, and it may involve reading
    from XML configuration files, database tables, or in-memory caches. It does not
    return any value but modifies internal state variables related to gender distribution.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution botDist;

      botDist.LoadGenderDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should ideally be called once during server startup or when enabling
    the bot system to ensure that gender distribution data is available for character
    creation. It's recommended to verify that the underlying configuration files exist
    and are properly formatted before invoking this method.
