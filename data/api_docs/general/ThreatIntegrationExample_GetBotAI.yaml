  class: ThreatIntegrationExample
  method: GetBotAI
  signature: BotAI * ThreatIntegrationExample::GetBotAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the BotAI instance associated with a specified player bot.
  description: The GetBotAI method is used to obtain the BotAI object that controls
    a specific player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method allows access
    to the artificial intelligence logic and behavior of the bot, enabling developers
    to interact with or modify the bot's decision-making processes. The returned BotAI
    pointer can be used to query or manipulate various aspects of the bot's AI state,
    such as its current target, movement behavior, or combat actions. This functionality
    is essential for creating custom bot behaviors, integrating third-party AI systems,
    or extending the existing bot AI capabilities in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI object associated with the specified player bot.
    Returns nullptr if the provided player is not a valid bot or if no AI instance
    is assigned to it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nBotAI* botAI =\
      \ ThreatIntegrationExample::GetBotAI(bot);\nif (botAI)\n{\n    // Use the bot\
      \ AI instance for further operations\n    // For example, get current target\n\
      \    Unit* target = botAI->GetTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nBotAI* botAI =\
      \ ThreatIntegrationExample::GetBotAI(bot);\nif (botAI != nullptr)\n{\n    //\
      \ Safely access bot AI functionality\n    if (botAI->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle combat logic\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where\
      \ bot has no AI assigned\n    sLog->outError(\"Bot %u has no AI assigned\",\
      \ bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Player object passed as parameter is actually
    a bot created through TrinityCore's bot system. The returned BotAI pointer should
    be used carefully, as improper handling can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that the player object remains valid throughout the lifetime of the BotAI
    reference.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned BotAI pointer will be valid - always perform
    null checks before using it. Using an invalid BotAI pointer can cause segmentation
    faults or other runtime errors. Additionally, modifying AI state directly through
    this interface may interfere with the normal operation of the bot's AI system.
