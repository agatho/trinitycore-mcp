  brief: Checks whether the social system is enabled for the player
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the social functionality, including
    friend lists, ignore lists, and communication features, is currently active for
    a player character. This check is typically used to conditionally enable or disable
    social-related UI elements and interactions in the game client. The method returns
    true if all social systems are enabled and functional, and false if any part of
    the social system has been disabled either globally or per-player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the social system is fully enabled for this player; otherwise
    returns false if the social system is disabled or partially restricted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Social Status
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Enable social UI elements\n\
      \    SendSocialInfo();\n} else {\n    // Disable social features\n    ShowSocialDisabledMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Social Feature Activation
    code: "void Player::UpdateSocialFeatures() {\n    if (socialManager->IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        // Enable friend list updates\n        UpdateFriendList();\n  \
      \      UpdateIgnoreList();\n        EnableChatChannels();\n    } else {\n  \
      \      // Disable all social features\n        DisableAllSocialFeatures();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal flags or configuration settings that
    control the social system's availability. It may be affected by server-side configurations,
    player account restrictions, or temporary game state conditions such as being
    in a restricted zone or during certain events.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value means all social features are fully
    functional; some features might be restricted by permissions or account status
    even if the system is marked as enabled. Always validate individual feature access
    when needed.
