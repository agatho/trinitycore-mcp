  method: HasPendingAction
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::HasPendingAction() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the combat behavior integration has any pending actions queued
    for execution.
  description: The HasPendingAction method determines whether there are any queued
    actions that have not yet been processed by the combat behavior system. This is
    typically used to prevent duplicate or conflicting actions from being initiated
    while a previous action is still in progress. The method evaluates the internal
    state of the CombatBehaviorIntegration object and returns true if there are pending
    actions, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    combat flow and preventing race conditions in AI-driven combat behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are pending actions queued for execution; returns
    false if no actions are currently pending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatBehavior->HasPendingAction()) {\n    // Handle case where action\
      \ is already pending\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with new action"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat State Management
    code: "void Unit::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (!HasPendingAction()) {\n    \
      \    // Queue next combat action\n        QueueNextCombatAction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during combat updates to ensure
    proper sequencing of actions. It's important to note that the return value may
    change between calls if actions are processed asynchronously. The implementation
    likely uses a simple flag or counter-based system internally.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in performance-critical sections without considering
    its internal implementation. If used in tight loops, it could potentially impact
    performance due to frequent state checks. Also, be aware that pending actions
    may be cleared asynchronously, so the result might not reflect the current state
    immediately after an action is queued.
