  class: BattlegroundQueueTypeId
  method: GetPacked
  signature: uint64 BattlegroundQueueTypeId::GetPacked() const
documentation:
  brief: Packs and returns the battleground queue type identifier as a 64-bit integer.
  description: The GetPacked method serializes the battleground queue type identifier
    into a single uint64 value. This packed representation is commonly used for network
    transmission, storage, or internal identification purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method ensures that all relevant queue type information is compactly
    encoded into a format suitable for efficient handling in game systems such as
    matchmaking, player queuing, and battleground management. It does not modify any
    internal state of the object and is typically called when a serialized form of
    the queue type is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the packed version of the battleground queue
    type identifier. This value uniquely identifies the queue type in a compact binary
    format suitable for use in network packets or internal data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BattlegroundQueueTypeId queueId = BattlegroundQueueTypeId(BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_AV);

      uint64 packedId = queueId.GetPacked();

      // packedId now contains the serialized queue type identifier

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The packed format is designed to be consistent across different platforms
    and compilers, ensuring that queue identifiers can be reliably transmitted between
    client and server. This method is typically used in conjunction with other serialization
    methods for handling battleground queue data.
