documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of Fel Rush charges available for the player
  description: The GetFelRushCharges method returns the count of Fel Rush charges
    currently possessed by the player. This method is typically used in the context
    of Warlock class abilities, where Fel Rush is a spell that can be cast multiple
    times before requiring a recharge period. The returned value represents how many
    more times the player can use the Fel Rush ability without waiting for charges
    to regenerate. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of Fel Rush charges currently available
    to the player. Returns 0 if no charges are available or if the player does not
    have access to the Fel Rush ability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 charges = player->GetMomentumTracker()->GetFelRushCharges();\nif\
      \ (charges > 0)\n{\n    // Player can use Fel Rush\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FEL_RUSH, true);\n    player->GetMomentumTracker()->ConsumeFelRushCharge();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Charges Before Casting
    code: "if (player->GetMomentumTracker()->GetFelRushCharges() >= 2)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player has enough charges for a two-charge combo\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FEL_RUSH_COMBO, true);\n}\nelse if (player->GetMomentumTracker()->GetFelRushCharges()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player can still cast one charge\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FEL_RUSH, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on players who are actually Warlocks or
    have access to Fel Rush mechanics. The actual charge regeneration logic is handled
    separately by the MomentumTracker class and may depend on various factors such
    as player level, gear, and talent points. This method does not perform any validation
    checks on whether the player can actually cast Fel Rush.
  warnings: This method returns a cached value that may not reflect real-time changes
    in charge count if the underlying system has not been updated. It's important
    to ensure that the MomentumTracker object is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
