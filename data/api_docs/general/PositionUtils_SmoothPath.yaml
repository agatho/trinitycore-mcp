  class: PositionUtils
  method: SmoothPath
  signature: int PositionUtils::SmoothPath(const int & rawPath)
documentation:
  brief: Smooths a raw path by applying pathfinding algorithms to reduce sharp turns
    and improve movement quality.
  description: The SmoothPath method processes a raw path defined by the input parameter
    to generate a more natural and efficient movement trajectory. It applies smoothing
    algorithms to reduce abrupt changes in direction, making NPC or player movement
    appear more fluid and realistic. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with pathfinding systems to enhance gameplay experience by ensuring characters
    follow smoother paths rather than rigid straight lines between waypoints. The
    rawPath parameter should contain a sequence of positions that define the original
    path, which will be modified in-place to produce the smoothed result.
  parameters:
  - name: rawPath
    description: Reference to an integer representing the identifier or index of the
      raw path data structure to be smoothed. This parameter must reference a valid
      path previously generated by a pathfinding system.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success status of the smoothing
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while
    non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters
    or internal processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Smoothing Usage
    code: "int rawPathId = 5;\nint result = PositionUtils::SmoothPath(rawPathId);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Path smoothing completed successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Path smoothed successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error condition\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to smooth path with error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the raw path data in-place, so it's important to ensure
    that the original path is not needed after calling this function. The smoothing
    algorithm may adjust the number of waypoints in the path depending on complexity
    and smoothing parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the rawPath parameter references a valid path before calling
    this method; otherwise, undefined behavior or crashes may occur. This method should
    only be called on paths that have already been generated through proper pathfinding
    routines.
