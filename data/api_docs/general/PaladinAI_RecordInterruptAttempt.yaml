  class: PaladinAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void PaladinAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(int * target, int spellId, bool
    success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an attempt to interrupt a spell cast by a target unit.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about a successful
    or failed spell interruption attempt made by a paladin AI. This method is typically
    used within the context of spell casting and combat behavior to track the effectiveness
    of interruption abilities such as Holy Shock or Avenger's Shield. It updates internal
    tracking mechanisms that may be used for cooldown management, performance analysis,
    or AI decision-making processes. The method accepts a pointer to the target unit,
    the spell ID being interrupted, and a success flag indicating whether the interruption
    was effective.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that attempted to cast the spell. This
      parameter represents the unit whose spell casting is being interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell being interrupted. This value corresponds
      to the Spell::Id field in the TrinityCore database and determines which spell
      was targeted for interruption.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interruption attempt was successful.
      True indicates a successful interruption, false indicates failure.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyPaladinAI::OnSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    Unit* target = spell->GetUnitTarget();\n\
      \    if (target && spell->IsSpellInterruptible())\n    {\n        bool success\
      \ = TryInterruptSpell(target, spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id);\n        RecordInterruptAttempt((int*)target,\
      \ spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id, success);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with AI Decision Making
    code: "void PaladinAI::ProcessInterruptAttempts()\n{\n    for (auto& attempt :\
      \ interruptAttempts)\n    {\n        if (attempt.success)\n        {\n     \
      \       // Increase cooldown or modify behavior\n            SetNextSpellCooldown(SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK,\
      \ 2000);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Log failed attempts\
      \ for analysis\n            sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Paladin AI failed\
      \ to interrupt spell %u on target %u\", \n                          attempt.spellId,\
      \ (uint32)attempt.target);\n        }\n    }\n    interruptAttempts.clear();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin AI system and should only be called from
    within the context of spell interruption logic. The target parameter must point
    to a valid Unit object; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The method does
    not perform any validation on the spellId, so callers should ensure it refers
    to a valid spell in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid target pointer will result in undefined
    behavior and potential crashes. Ensure that the target unit is alive and valid
    before calling this function. Also, be cautious when using the spellId parameter
    as incorrect values may lead to improper tracking or AI decision making.
