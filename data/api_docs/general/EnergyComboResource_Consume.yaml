  class: EnergyComboResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool EnergyComboResource::Consume(uint32 energyCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes energy cost from the combo resource and returns true if successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to reduce the current energy combo resource
    by the specified energy cost. It checks whether sufficient resources are available
    before deducting them. This method is typically used in game mechanics where abilities
    or actions consume energy, such as in rogue class abilities that require energy
    to perform combos. The method ensures resource integrity by validating the requested
    amount against available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: energyCost
    description: The amount of energy to be consumed from the combo resource. Must
      be a positive integer representing the energy cost of an ability or action.
  returns: Returns true if the specified energy cost was successfully deducted from
    the combo resource; returns false if there were insufficient resources to fulfill
    the request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetComboPoints() > 0) {\n    bool success = player->Consume(50);\n\
      \    if (success) {\n        // Energy successfully consumed, proceed with combo\
      \ action\n    } else {\n        // Not enough energy, handle accordingly\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Energy Consumption in Ability Execution
    code: "void ExecuteRogueAbility(Player* player, uint32 abilityEnergyCost) {\n\
      \    if (player->Consume(abilityEnergyCost)) {\n        // Proceed with ability\
      \ execution\n        player->CastSpell(player, 12345); // Example spell\n  \
      \  } else {\n        // Notify player of insufficient energy\n        player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough energy to perform this action.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with combo point systems and
    energy-based abilities. It's important to note that the resource management logic
    may vary depending on the specific subclass of EnergyComboResource, such as for
    rogues or other classes with energy mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the energy cost being requested does not exceed available
    resources; otherwise, the method will return false without modifying the resource
    state. This can lead to incorrect gameplay behavior if not handled properly in
    calling code.
