  signature: CombatPositionContext RoleBasedCombatPositioning::AnalyzeCombatContext(Player
    * bot, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the combat context for a bot player and its group to determine optimal
    positioning strategy.
  description: The AnalyzeCombatContext method evaluates the current combat situation
    involving a specified bot player and their group members. It assesses factors
    such as enemy positions, health statuses, threat levels, and role distribution
    within the group to generate a comprehensive CombatPositionContext object. This
    context is used by the AI system to make informed decisions about positioning,
    targeting, and movement during encounters. The method considers both individual
    player states and collective group dynamics to ensure optimal tactical positioning
    for maximum effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CombatPositionContext object containing detailed analysis of the combat
    environment, including threat assessments, positioning recommendations, and role-based
    strategic suggestions for the bot player and group members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CombatPositionContext context = roleBasedCombatPositioning.AnalyzeCombatContext(botPlayer,\
      \ playerGroup);\n// Use context to determine optimal positioning strategy\n\
      if (context.needsRepositioning)\n{\n    // Execute repositioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs intensive analysis of combat state data and may have
    performance implications during high-frequency AI decision making. The returned
    context object should be treated as immutable for the duration of its use in tactical
    decisions.
  warnings: The method assumes valid player and group pointers; calling with null
    parameters may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot player is actually
    part of the specified group before invoking this method.
