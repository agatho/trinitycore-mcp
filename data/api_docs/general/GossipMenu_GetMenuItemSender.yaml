  signature: uint32 GossipMenu::GetMenuItemSender(uint32 orderIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the sender identifier associated with a specific menu item in the
    gossip dialog.
  description: The GetMenuItemSender method retrieves the unique sender identifier
    (typically a GUID or custom ID) that was assigned to a specific menu item within
    a gossip menu. This identifier is used by the game's gossip system to determine
    which action should be executed when a player selects a particular option. The
    method takes an order index to identify the specific menu item, and returns the
    associated sender value. It is commonly used in conjunction with other gossip-related
    methods to build dynamic and interactive NPC conversations. The method assumes
    that the gossip menu has been properly initialized and populated with menu items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the sender identifier for the specified
    menu item. This value is typically used to identify the action or script to execute
    when the player selects the corresponding menu option.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve sender ID for first menu item
    code: "uint32 senderId = gossipMenu.GetMenuItemSender(0);\nif (senderId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process the sender ID to determine next action\n    switch (senderId)\n\
      \    {\n        case 1:\n            // Handle first option\n            break;\n\
      \        case 2:\n            // Handle second option\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the gossip menu system and should only be called after
    a gossip menu has been properly constructed. The orderIndex parameter must be
    within valid bounds; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Performance is generally
    fast as it's a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the gossip menu has been populated with items before calling
    this method. Using an invalid orderIndex (e.g., beyond the number of items) may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect values being returned.
