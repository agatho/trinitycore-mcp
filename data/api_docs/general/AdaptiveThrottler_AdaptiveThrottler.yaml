  class: AdaptiveThrottler
  method: AdaptiveThrottler
  signature: void AdaptiveThrottler::AdaptiveThrottler()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AdaptiveThrottler instance with default configuration settings.
  description: The AdaptiveThrottler constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AdaptiveThrottler class, setting up internal state variables and default throttling
    parameters. This class is designed to dynamically adjust processing rates based
    on system load or other configurable metrics. It typically manages resource utilization
    by controlling how frequently certain operations are executed, preventing system
    overload during high-demand periods. The constructor ensures that all necessary
    data structures are properly allocated and initialized before the throttler becomes
    active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'AdaptiveThrottler throttler;

      // Initializes a new AdaptiveThrottler with default settings'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Game Loop Context
    code: "class MyGameSystem\n{\nprivate:\n    AdaptiveThrottler m_throttler;\npublic:\n\
      \    void Update()\n    {\n        if (m_throttler.ShouldProcess())\n      \
      \  {\n            // Perform resource-intensive operation\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AdaptiveThrottler is typically used in performance-critical systems where
    maintaining consistent frame rates or processing throughput is important. It's
    commonly found in AI systems, network packet handling, and other scenarios requiring
    dynamic rate limiting.
  warnings: Ensure that the AdaptiveThrottler is properly initialized before any calls
    to ShouldProcess() are made, as using an uninitialized instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or system instability.
