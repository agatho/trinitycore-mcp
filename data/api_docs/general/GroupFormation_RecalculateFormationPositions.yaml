  class: GroupFormation
  method: RecalculateFormationPositions
  signature: void GroupFormation::RecalculateFormationPositions()
documentation:
  brief: Recalculates and updates the formation positions for all members of the group
    based on their current locations and the group's formation settings.
  description: The RecalculateFormationPositions method is responsible for dynamically
    updating the spatial arrangement of group members within a formation. This method
    ensures that each member maintains proper positioning relative to others in the
    group, taking into account factors such as distance, orientation, and group configuration.
    It is typically invoked when there are changes in the group's composition or member
    positions that require a recalibration of the formation layout. The method operates
    on the current state of the group and updates internal formation data structures
    without requiring external input.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Update Context
    code: "void OnGroupMemberAdded(Group* group)\n{\n    // After adding a new member,\
      \ recalculate formation\n    if (group && group->IsFormationEnabled())\n   \
      \ {\n        group->GetFormation()->RecalculateFormationPositions();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group is in a valid state and
    formation is enabled. It may cause temporary movement adjustments for group members
    as they are repositioned according to the new formation calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or high-frequency updates might
    introduce performance overhead. Ensure that it's not invoked too frequently to
    avoid unnecessary processing.
