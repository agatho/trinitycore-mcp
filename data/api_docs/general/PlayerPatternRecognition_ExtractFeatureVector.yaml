documentation:
  brief: Extracts a feature vector from a behavior sample for pattern recognition
    analysis
  description: The ExtractFeatureVector method processes a BehaviorSample object to
    generate a numerical feature vector that represents the player's behavioral patterns.
    This vector is typically used in machine learning algorithms for identifying player
    behavior types, detecting anomalies, or classifying play styles within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method analyzes various aspects of player actions such as movement
    patterns, interaction frequency, and decision-making sequences to create a comprehensive
    representation suitable for AI-based pattern recognition systems. The returned
    integer indicates success or failure status of the extraction process, with positive
    values typically representing successful vector generation and negative values
    indicating errors or invalid input data.
  parameters:
  - name: sample
    description: The BehaviorSample object containing player behavior data to be analyzed
      and converted into a feature vector. This parameter must contain valid behavioral
      data collected from player actions within the game environment.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the feature
    vector extraction process. A positive return value typically indicates successful
    extraction, while negative values may represent errors such as invalid input data,
    insufficient behavioral information, or internal processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Feature Vector Extraction
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition recognizer;\nBehaviorSample sample = player.GetBehaviorSample();\n\
      int result = recognizer.ExtractFeatureVector(sample);\nif (result > 0) {\n \
      \   // Feature vector successfully extracted\n    std::cout << \"Feature vector\
      \ extracted successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle extraction\
      \ error\n    std::cout << \"Failed to extract feature vector\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pattern Recognition Integration
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition recognizer;\nBehaviorSample sample = player.GetBehaviorSample();\n\
      int result = recognizer.ExtractFeatureVector(sample);\nif (result > 0) {\n \
      \   // Use extracted features for AI classification\n    std::vector<float>\
      \ features = recognizer.GetFeatureVector();\n    PlayerBehaviorType behavior\
      \ = classifier.Classify(features);\n    player.SetDetectedBehavior(behavior);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior analysis system in TrinityCore and
    requires valid BehaviorSample data to produce meaningful results. The feature
    vector generated may be used for various purposes including player profiling,
    cheating detection, or game difficulty adjustment. Performance considerations
    include the computational complexity of analyzing behavioral patterns, especially
    when processing large volumes of player data simultaneously.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input BehaviorSample contains valid and complete
    behavioral data. Passing incomplete or corrupted sample data may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect feature vectors. Developers should ensure proper validation
    of input data before calling this method to avoid potential errors in downstream
    AI processing systems.
