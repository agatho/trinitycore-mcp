documentation:
  brief: Returns the list of units threatened by the player's current target.
  description: This method retrieves the list of units that are currently threatening
    the player's current target. It is used in the context of threat management within
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, where it helps determine which mobs
    or players have active threat on a specific target. The method provides access
    to the internal threat list for the current target, allowing developers to analyze
    and manage threat dynamics effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to a list of units that are currently threatening
    the player's target. This list contains all units with active threat on the target,
    including players and NPCs, and can be used for various threat management operations
    such as checking whether a unit is in the threat list or determining the order
    of threat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: auto const& threatList = pPlayer->GetThreatenedByMeList();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical code, as it
    involves accessing internal threat data structures. It is primarily intended for
    use in threat management systems and may not be suitable for general gameplay
    mechanics due to its specific nature.
  warnings: The returned list may change during combat or when threat changes occur,
    so developers should be cautious about using this method in situations where the
    threat list might be modified by other processes. Also, this method does not guarantee
    that the list will contain only one unit; it may include multiple units with active
    threat.
