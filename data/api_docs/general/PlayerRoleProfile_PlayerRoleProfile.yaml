  signature: void PlayerRoleProfile::PlayerRoleProfile(uint32 guid, uint8 cls, uint8
    spec, uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a player role profile with GUID, class, specialization, and level
    information.
  description: The PlayerRoleProfile constructor initializes a player's role profile
    by storing essential identifying information including the player's unique identifier
    (GUID), their character class, selected specialization, and current level. This
    method is typically used during player login or when creating a new role profile
    for a character within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization process sets
    up internal data structures that track player roles and capabilities for gameplay
    mechanics such as raid assignments, talent management, and class-specific abilities.
    This constructor ensures that all necessary player role data is properly established
    before the character becomes active in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player character. This value
      uniquely identifies the player across the entire game world and is used for
      tracking player state, inventory, and other persistent data.
  - name: cls
    description: The player's class type represented as a numeric value. Valid values
      typically correspond to standard WoW class IDs such as 1 for Warrior, 2 for
      Paladin, 3 for Hunter, etc., though exact mappings depend on the TrinityCore
      version and custom configurations.
  - name: spec
    description: The player's current specialization (talent tree) represented as
      a numeric value. This indicates which of the available specializations the player
      has chosen for their class, affecting available abilities and gameplay mechanics.
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the player character. This value determines
      the player's progression in the game and affects various aspects such as available
      spells, item requirements, and experience thresholds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Role Profile Initialization
    code: 'PlayerRoleProfile profile(123456, 7, 2, 80);

      // Initializes a profile for a Hunter (class 7) with Arms specialization (spec
      2) at level 80'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Profile During Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    uint8 cls = player->getClass();\n    uint8 spec = player->GetSpecializationId();\n\
      \    uint32 level = player->getLevel();\n    \n    PlayerRoleProfile profile(guid,\
      \ cls, spec, level);\n    // Profile initialized with current player data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal member variables and may perform
    validation on input parameters. The class assumes that the provided GUID is valid
    and unique within the context of the TrinityCore instance. It's important to note
    that this method does not persist data to database or perform any network operations
    - it only sets up the in-memory profile structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an existing player character,
    as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior when the profile is later used
    in gameplay systems. The class and specialization values must be within expected
    ranges for the specific TrinityCore version being used; otherwise, unexpected
    behavior may occur during role-based gameplay mechanics.
