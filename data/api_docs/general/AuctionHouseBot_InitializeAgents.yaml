  class: AuctionHouseBot
  method: InitializeAgents
  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::InitializeAgents()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all auction house bot agents and their associated data structures.
  description: The InitializeAgents method sets up and prepares all internal agents
    responsible for managing auction house operations within the AuctionHouseBot system.
    This includes initializing agent-specific data structures, registering callbacks,
    setting up configuration parameters, and preparing the bot to interact with the
    auction house system. The method ensures that all necessary components are ready
    before the bot begins processing auctions, including handling item listings, bidding
    strategies, and market analysis routines. It typically runs during the startup
    phase of the AuctionHouseBot module and must be called before any auction-related
    operations can take place.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot bot;

      bot.InitializeAgents();

      // Bot is now ready to process auctions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's initialization phase.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or memory leaks. The method performs
    no locking, so it should be called from a single-threaded context.
  warnings: Calling this method after the bot has already started processing auctions
    may cause instability or data corruption. Ensure all configuration settings are
    properly set before calling this method.
