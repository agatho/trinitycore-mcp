  class: ServerScript
  method: ServerScript
  signature: void ServerScript::ServerScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a server script with the specified name.
  description: The ServerScript constructor initializes a server-side script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to register and configure server-side scripts that handle various game events,
    commands, or custom behaviors. The script name serves as an identifier for the
    script instance and is used internally by the server to manage script lifecycle
    and execution context. This constructor is part of the broader scripting system
    that allows developers to extend core game functionality through custom C++ implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string containing the unique identifier name for
      this server script instance. This name is used internally by the TrinityCore
      server to manage and reference the script during runtime.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Server Script Initialization
    code: "class MyServerScript : public ServerScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyServerScript()\
      \ : ServerScript(\"MyCustomScript\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Server Script with Dynamic Name
    code: "void RegisterCustomScript()\n{\n    const char* scriptName = \"DynamicScript_\"\
      \ + std::to_string(GetTickCount());\n    ServerScript* script = new ServerScript(scriptName);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the server initialization phase
    or when dynamically loading scripts. The name parameter should be unique to avoid
    conflicts in the script registry. The ServerScript class is part of TrinityCore's
    modular scripting architecture, allowing for extensibility without modifying core
    server code.
  warnings: Ensure that the script name provided is valid and does not contain special
    characters that could cause issues with internal registry handling. Avoid using
    empty or null strings as they may lead to undefined behavior in the script management
    system.
