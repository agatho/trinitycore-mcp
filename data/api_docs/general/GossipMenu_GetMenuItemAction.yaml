documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the action identifier associated with a specific menu item in the
    gossip menu.
  description: The GetMenuItemAction method retrieves the action identifier (uint32)
    that is associated with a menu item at the specified order index within the gossip
    menu. This action identifier typically corresponds to a specific interaction or
    script trigger when the player selects that menu option. The method allows developers
    to access and potentially modify the behavior of individual menu items during
    NPC gossip interactions. It is commonly used in conjunction with other gossip
    menu methods to build dynamic and interactive dialogue systems for NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the action identifier of the menu item
    at the specified order index. This value usually maps to a specific script, quest,
    or interaction that will be executed when the player selects that menu option.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Action ID for First Menu Item
    code: "uint32 actionId = gossipMenu->GetMenuItemAction(0);\nif (actionId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process the action based on the retrieved ID\n    switch (actionId)\n\
      \    {\n        case 1:\n            // Handle quest selection\n           \
      \ break;\n        case 2:\n            // Handle vendor interaction\n      \
      \      break;\n        default:\n            // Default handling\n         \
      \   break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the gossip menu has been properly initialized and
    populated with menu items. The orderIndex parameter should be within valid bounds
    to avoid undefined behavior. The returned action ID is typically used in conjunction
    with other TrinityCore systems like quest handling, vendor interactions, or custom
    scripts.
  warnings: Ensure that the orderIndex provided is valid (not exceeding the number
    of menu items) to prevent accessing invalid memory or returning unexpected values.
    This method should only be called on a properly initialized GossipMenu object.
