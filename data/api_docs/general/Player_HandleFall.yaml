documentation:
  brief: Handles player fall movement and updates player position
  description: The HandleFall method processes player movement information when falling,
    updating the player's position and handling fall-related mechanics in the game
    world. This method is typically invoked during movement updates to manage player
    falling behavior, including calculating fall distance, applying gravity effects,
    and updating player coordinates. It ensures proper handling of fall movement data
    within TrinityCore's movement system.
  parameters:
  - name: movementInfo
    description: The movement information structure containing fall-related data such
      as velocity, position, and time. This parameter includes details about the player's
      current falling state and movement parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fall Handling Example
    code: "void Player::HandleFall(const int & movementInfo)\n{\n    // Process fall\
      \ movement\n    // Update player position\n    // Apply gravity effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement handling system and should be called
    during movement updates. Implementation requires careful handling of movement
    data structures to ensure proper fall mechanics.
  warnings: Improper handling of movementInfo can cause position errors or movement
    glitches. Ensure correct movement data structure handling for accurate fall processing.
