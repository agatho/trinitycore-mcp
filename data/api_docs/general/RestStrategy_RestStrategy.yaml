documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the RestStrategy class for managing player
    rest behavior in the game.
  description: The RestStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the RestStrategy
    class, which is responsible for handling the logic related to player resting mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. This includes determining when a player should rest, how
    long they should rest, and what actions should occur during the resting process.
    The strategy typically integrates with the AI system to manage player behavior
    during rest periods, ensuring that players can recover from combat or other activities
    according to game rules and mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RestStrategy instance
    code: 'RestStrategy* strategy = new RestStrategy();

      // The strategy is now initialized and ready to be used by the AI system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic object state for the RestStrategy class.
    The actual rest behavior logic is typically implemented in other methods of the
    class rather than in the constructor.
