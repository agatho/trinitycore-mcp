documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI animation kit ID associated with the WorldObject
  description: The GetAIAnimKitId method retrieves the unique identifier for the animation
    kit used by the WorldObject's AI system. This value determines which animations
    are played when the object interacts with the environment or performs actions.
    The method is commonly used in conjunction with AI behavior scripting to ensure
    proper animation sequences during combat or non-combat situations. It typically
    returns a value that corresponds to an entry in the AIAnimKit database table,
    allowing developers to customize the visual behavior of NPCs and objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 representing the AI animation kit ID. This value corresponds
    to an entry in the AIAnimKit database table, where 0 indicates no specific animation
    kit is assigned, and non-zero values represent valid animation kit IDs for use
    in AI behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 animKitId = object->GetAIAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform actions based on the animation kit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for AI-related functionality in TrinityCore.
    It should be called only when the WorldObject has an associated AI system, and
    it's recommended to check if the object actually has AI before calling this method.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with objects that may not have
    AI assigned. If the object lacks AI, calling this method might return invalid
    or unexpected values. Also, ensure that the returned value matches valid entries
    in the AIAnimKit database table to avoid runtime errors.
