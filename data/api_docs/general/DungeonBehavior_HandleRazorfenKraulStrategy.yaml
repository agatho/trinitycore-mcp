  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleRazorfenKraulStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleRazorfenKraulStrategy(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the Razorfen Kraul dungeon strategy for a given group and encounter
    ID.
  description: The HandleRazorfenKraulStrategy method manages the AI behavior and
    tactical decisions for the Razorfen Kraul dungeon instance. This method is responsible
    for coordinating group actions, managing encounter-specific strategies, and ensuring
    proper execution of dungeon mechanics based on the current encounter ID. It integrates
    with the broader DungeonBehavior system to provide intelligent NPC decision-making
    and group management during the dungeon run.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player party participating
      in Razorfen Kraul. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current dungeon encounter. Determines which
      strategy and behaviors are applied during the encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "DungeonBehavior* db = sObjectAccessor->GetDungeonBehaviorForGroup(group);\n\
      if (db)\n{\n    db->HandleRazorfenKraulStrategy(group, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy handling with encounter state check
    code: "if (encounterId > 0 && encounterId <= MAX_RAZORFEN_KRAUL_ENCOUNTERS)\n\
      {\n    HandleRazorfenKraulStrategy(group, encounterId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Log error or handle invalid encounter ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's dungeon AI system and should only
    be called when a group enters or progresses through Razorfen Kraul. The method
    assumes that the group has already been validated and initialized for dungeon
    participation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid encounterId may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    AI decisions during the dungeon encounter.
