documentation:
  brief: Handles spell effects on target units, items, gameobjects, corpses, or other
    spell targets during spell execution.
  description: This method processes and applies various spell effects based on the
    target type and effect mode. It is responsible for executing specific actions
    related to spell mechanics such as damage, healing, summoning, or stat modifications
    depending on the effect type and target. The method handles different types of
    targets including Unit (player or creature), Item, GameObject, Corpse, and other
    special targets. It ensures that each spell effect is properly applied according
    to its intended behavior and mode, which can be either direct or periodic. This
    method is crucial for implementing spell functionality in TrinityCore's core mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: pUnitTarget
    description: Pointer to the target unit (player or creature) that the spell effect
      will be applied to. Can be nullptr if no unit target exists.
  - name: pItemTarget
    description: Pointer to the target item that the spell effect will be applied
      to. Can be nullptr if no item target exists.
  - name: pGoTarget
    description: Pointer to the target gameobject that the spell effect will be applied
      to. Can be nullptr if no gameobject target exists.
  - name: pCorpseTarget
    description: Pointer to the target corpse that the spell effect will be applied
      to. Can be nullptr if no corpse target exists.
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Reference to the SpellEffectInfo structure containing details about
      the specific effect being processed, including effect type, base damage, etc.
  - name: mode
    description: SpellEffectHandleMode enum value indicating whether the effect is
      applied directly or periodically (e.g., DoT, HoT).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::HandleEffects(Unit * pUnitTarget, Item * pItemTarget, GameObject\
      \ * pGoTarget, Corpse * pCorpseTarget, const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,\
      \ SpellEffectHandleMode mode)\n{\n    // Implementation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "void Spell::HandleEffects(Unit * pUnitTarget, Item * pItemTarget, GameObject\
      \ * pGoTarget, Corpse * pCorpseTarget, const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,\
      \ SpellEffectHandleMode mode)\n{\n    switch (mode)\n    {\n        case SPELL_EFFECT_HANDLE_DIRECT:\n\
      \            // Apply direct effect\n            break;\n        case SPELL_EFFECT_HANDLE_PERIODIC:\n\
      \            // Apply periodic effect\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell handling system and should be called
    only when a spell is being executed. It requires proper initialization of targets
    before calling, and may involve complex logic depending on effect type and mode.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary target checks and ensuring
    correct target types are passed.
  warnings: Improper handling of targets can lead to crashes or incorrect behavior.
    Care must be taken when passing nullptr values for targets, especially in cases
    where the spell effect requires specific target types. Ensure that the correct
    mode is selected based on the intended effect type.
