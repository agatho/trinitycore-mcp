  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnGroupMemberAdded
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupMemberAdded(Player * member)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a new member is added to the player's group in the
    EnhancedBotAI system.
  description: The OnGroupMemberAdded method is invoked whenever a new player joins
    the group controlled by an EnhancedBotAI instance. This method allows the AI to
    react to group composition changes, potentially initializing new bot behaviors,
    updating group strategies, or synchronizing state information with the newly added
    member. It serves as a key integration point for dynamic group management within
    the TrinityCore framework's bot AI architecture. The method is typically called
    during group creation or membership modification events and ensures that all bots
    in the group are properly synchronized with the new member's presence.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the newly added group member.
      This parameter must not be null, as it represents a valid player entity within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Join Event
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupMemberAdded(Player* member)\n{\n    if (!member)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Initialize bot behavior for new group member\n\
      \    InitializeNewMemberBehavior(member);\n    \n    // Update group strategy\
      \ based on new member\n    UpdateGroupStrategy();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Bot Synchronization
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupMemberAdded(Player* member)\n{\n    if (!member\
      \ || !IsBot(member))\n        return;\n    \n    // Synchronize bot's knowledge\
      \ of the new member\n    m_botKnowledge.UpdateMember(member);\n    \n    //\
      \ Notify other bots about the new member\n    for (auto& bot : GetGroupBots())\n\
      \    {\n        if (bot != member)\n            bot->OnNewGroupMember(member);\n\
      \    }\n    \n    // Adjust tactical positioning\n    AdjustFormation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI's event-driven architecture and
    should be implemented to handle group membership changes efficiently. The method
    may be called multiple times during a single group operation, so implementations
    should avoid redundant operations or state modifications. Consider thread safety
    implications if this method is invoked from different threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the member parameter is validated before use, as null pointers
    can cause crashes. Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations
    within this method to maintain game performance. Be cautious when modifying group
    state directly from this handler without proper synchronization mechanisms.
