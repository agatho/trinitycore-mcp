documentation:
  brief: Generates character data for a bot based on the provided creation task.
  description: The GenerateCharacterData method is responsible for creating and initializing
    all necessary character attributes, stats, and properties for a bot within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method processes the BotCreationTask object to determine
    the appropriate level, class, race, and other characteristics of the bot. It ensures
    that the generated bot character adheres to game mechanics and rules, such as
    level progression, stat distribution, and valid class/race combinations. The method
    typically operates during bot creation or respawn scenarios, setting up the internal
    data structures required for the bot to function within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: A pointer to a BotCreationTask object that contains all the necessary
      parameters and configuration for creating a bot character. This includes level,
      class, race, faction, and other relevant attributes required for character generation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot creation using GenerateCharacterData
    code: 'BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();

      task->level = 60;

      task->playerClass = CLASS_WARRIOR;

      task->race = RACE_HUMAN;

      BotLevelManager levelManager;

      levelManager.GenerateCharacterData(task);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when a new bot
    needs to be created with specific parameters. The method assumes that the BotCreationTask
    object has been properly initialized with valid data before being passed to it.
