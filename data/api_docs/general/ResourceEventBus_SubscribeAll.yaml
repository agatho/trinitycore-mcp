  signature: bool ResourceEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all available resource events in the EventBus
    system
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber with the
    ResourceEventBus to receive notifications for all types of resource-related events.
    This allows the bot to react to various game state changes such as resource collection,
    depletion, or availability updates without needing to manually subscribe to each
    individual event type. The method typically returns true if the subscription was
    successful and false if it failed due to invalid input or internal errors. This
    functionality is crucial for bots that need comprehensive awareness of resource
    dynamics in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that wishes to subscribe to all resource
      events. Must be a valid, initialized BotAI object or nullptr will result in
      failure.
  returns: True if the subscription was successfully added for all event types; false
    if the operation failed due to invalid subscriber or internal error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = ResourceEventBus::SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all resource events\n    printf(\"\
      Successfully subscribed to all resource events\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ subscription failure\n    printf(\"Failed to subscribe to resource events\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling with Null Subscriber
    code: "BotAI* nullBot = nullptr;\nbool success = ResourceEventBus::SubscribeAll(nullBot);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Expected behavior when passing nullptr\n    printf(\"\
      Cannot subscribe null bot to events\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely internally iterates through all known resource event types
    and registers the subscriber with each one. It may have performance implications
    if there are many event types or if called frequently during runtime. The EventBus
    system should handle duplicate subscriptions gracefully.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null BotAI pointer will likely cause undefined
    behavior or return false. Ensure that the BotAI instance is fully initialized
    before calling SubscribeAll, as attempting to subscribe an uninitialized bot may
    lead to crashes or missed events.
