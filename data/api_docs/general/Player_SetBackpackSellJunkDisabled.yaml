  signature: void Player::SetBackpackSellJunkDisabled(bool disabled)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables the automatic selling of junk items in the player's backpack.
  description: This method controls whether the player's backpack automatically sells
    junk items when the player is in a state where such actions would normally occur.
    It affects the behavior of the game's automatic selling system for junk items,
    allowing developers to control whether junk items are sold automatically or kept
    in the inventory. The method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related
    settings to manage inventory behavior and prevent unwanted item loss.
  parameters:
  - name: disabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to disable (true) or enable (false)
      automatic selling of junk items in the backpack.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetBackpackSellJunkDisabled(true);

      // This disables automatic selling of junk items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      bool disable = true;

      player->SetBackpackSellJunkDisabled(disable);

      // This enables the player to manually manage junk items

      // rather than letting them auto-sell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the player's inventory management behavior in the context
    of World of Warcraft gameplay mechanics. It should be used carefully as it can
    impact how players manage their inventory and may interfere with certain questing
    or loot systems if not properly handled.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected loss of items or incorrect
    behavior in player inventory management, particularly when combined with other
    inventory-related methods.
