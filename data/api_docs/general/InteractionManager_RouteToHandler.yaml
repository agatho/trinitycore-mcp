  class: InteractionManager

  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::RouteToHandler(Player * bot, WorldObject
    * target, InteractionType type)
documentation:
  brief: Routes interaction requests from a bot player to an appropriate handler based
    on target and interaction type.
  description: The RouteToHandler method in the InteractionManager class determines
    and invokes the correct interaction handler for a given bot player, target object,
    and interaction type. This method serves as a central dispatcher that selects
    the appropriate response logic based on the provided parameters. It evaluates
    the target's type, the interaction type requested, and the bot's current state
    to route the interaction appropriately. The method is typically used within AI
    systems where bots need to perform different actions depending on what they're
    interacting with and how they're interacting.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that initiated
      the interaction. Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will result in
      undefined behavior.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is the target of the interaction.
      Can be any WorldObject subclass such as GameObject, Creature, or Item. Must
      not be null.
  - name: type
    description: The InteractionType enum value indicating what kind of interaction
      is being requested. Defines the semantic meaning of the interaction (e.g., Gossip,
      Quest, Vendor).
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum value that indicates whether the interaction
    was successfully handled, failed, or requires further processing. Possible values
    include SUCCESS, FAILED, CONTINUE, or other custom result codes defined by the
    interaction system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic interaction routing
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager->RouteToHandler(botPlayer,\
      \ targetObject, InteractionType::GOSSIP);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Handle successful gossip interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling quest interactions
    code: "WorldObject* questGiver = bot->GetSelectedUnit();\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = interactionManager->RouteToHandler(bot, questGiver, InteractionType::QUEST);\n\
      switch (result) {\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Quest accepted\
      \ or completed\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILED:\n      \
      \  // Could not initiate quest\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI interaction system and should only be
    called when a bot has determined it needs to interact with a specific target.
    The method assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    It performs no validation on inputs beyond basic null checks, so callers must
    ensure proper state before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null 'bot' or 'target' parameter will likely
    cause a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot is in a valid state (not
    dead, not in combat if required) and that the target exists and is accessible
    before routing interactions.
