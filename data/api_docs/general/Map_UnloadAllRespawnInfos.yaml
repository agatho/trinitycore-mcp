documentation:
  brief: Unloads all respawn information for objects on the map.
  description: The UnloadAllRespawnInfos method clears and releases all respawn-related
    data for objects currently loaded in the map. This includes removing stored respawn
    times, locations, and other tracking information for creatures, game objects,
    and other entities that have respawned. The method is typically invoked when unloading
    a map or during server shutdown to free memory and ensure clean state management.
    It does not affect the current objects in the world, but rather cleans up the
    data structures used to track their respawn behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect respawn timers and
    tracking for creatures and game objects. It is usually invoked during map unloading
    or server shutdown processes to ensure clean memory management.
