  method: IsMoving
  signature: bool BotAI::IsMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot is currently in a moving state.
  description: The IsMoving method determines whether the bot AI is currently executing
    movement operations. This includes checking if the bot is walking, running, or
    otherwise transitioning between positions. The method evaluates the internal state
    of the bot's movement system to return an accurate boolean result indicating active
    movement status. This functionality is crucial for AI decision-making processes
    that depend on the bot's current mobility state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently moving (walking, running, or transitioning
    between positions), false otherwise. The method does not distinguish between different
    types of movement but simply indicates whether any movement activity is occurring.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Check
    code: "if (botAI->IsMoving()) {\n    // Bot is currently moving\n    botAI->StopMovement();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement State Monitoring
    code: "void BotBehavior::Update() {\n    if (!botAI->IsMoving()) {\n        //\
      \ Bot has stopped moving, perform next action\n        botAI->MoveToTarget();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal movement state tracking of the bot AI
    system. It may not reflect real-time position changes immediately due to potential
    state update delays. The implementation likely checks various movement-related
    flags and states within the bot's AI context.
  warnings: The return value might not be immediately consistent with the actual physical
    movement state if there are pending movement commands or if the bot is in a transitional
    state between movement operations. This could lead to race conditions in fast-paced
    AI decision-making scenarios.
