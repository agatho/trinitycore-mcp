  method: ~AIDecisionProfiler
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::~AIDecisionProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AIDecisionProfiler instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ~AIDecisionProfiler destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the AIDecisionProfiler class. This method is
    automatically invoked when an AIDecisionProfiler object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation, including any internal
    data structures used for profiling AI decision-making processes in the game engine.
    The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations,
    as it is a destructor method. This functionality is crucial for maintaining memory
    efficiency and preventing memory leaks during gameplay when AI behavior is being
    monitored or analyzed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of AIDecisionProfiler
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      // ... use profiler ...

      // profiler automatically destroyed here when going out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion of AIDecisionProfiler
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler* profiler = new AIDecisionProfiler();

      // ... use profiler ...

      delete profiler; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called manually unless you have a specific reason, as it's part
    of the automatic memory management system in C++. The profiler may maintain internal
    timing data structures that are cleaned up during destruction.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor is designed to work seamlessly with standard
    C++ object lifecycle management. If used incorrectly, it could lead to undefined
    behavior or double-free errors in memory management.
