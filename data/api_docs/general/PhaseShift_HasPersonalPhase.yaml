api:
  class: PhaseShift
  method: HasPersonalPhase
  signature: bool PhaseShift::HasPersonalPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the PhaseShift object contains a personal phase.
  description: The HasPersonalPhase method checks if the current PhaseShift object
    has an active personal phase assigned to it. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, phases are used to control visibility and interaction within different
    game contexts, such as world events, instance scenarios, or player-specific conditions.
    A personal phase typically represents a unique phase context that is specific
    to an individual player or object. This method is commonly used in game logic
    to determine if certain visual or functional elements should be active based on
    the current phase state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the PhaseShift object has a personal phase assigned; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (phaseShift.HasPersonalPhase()) {\n    // Perform actions that require\
      \ a personal phase\n    SendPhaseUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Phase
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nPhaseShift& phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();\n\
      if (phaseShift.HasPersonalPhase()) {\n    // Apply personal phase effects\n\
      \    player->SetVisible(true);\n} else {\n    // Fallback to default visibility\n\
      \    player->SetVisible(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other phase-related APIs
    to manage game state and visibility. It's important to note that the presence
    of a personal phase does not necessarily mean that all phase-related functionality
    is active, as additional checks might be required for full phase enforcement.
