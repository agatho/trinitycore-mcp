documentation:
  brief: Cancels a commodity quote in the auction house system by its unique identifier.
  description: The CancelCommodityQuote method removes an active commodity quote from
    the auction house system. This function is typically invoked when a player wishes
    to withdraw their bid or offer for a specific commodity item. The method takes
    a GUID parameter that uniquely identifies the commodity quote within the auction
    house database. It performs internal validation to ensure the quote exists and
    is in a cancellable state before proceeding with removal. The cancellation process
    updates relevant auction house data structures and may trigger notifications to
    affected parties.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the commodity quote to be cancelled.
      This value corresponds to the database entry for the specific auction item being
      withdrawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cancel a Commodity Quote
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* auctionHouse = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      auctionHouse->CancelCommodityQuote(123456);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the GUID provided corresponds to an existing commodity
    quote. It's recommended to verify quote existence before calling this function
    to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior.
