  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: GetVersionSequence
  signature: std::vector<std::string> PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetVersionSequence(const
    std::string & fromVersion, const std::string & toVersion)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a sequence of migration version strings from a starting version to
    a target version.
  description: The GetVersionSequence method retrieves an ordered list of version
    identifiers that represent the migration path from a specified starting version
    to a target version. This is typically used in TrinityCore's player bot system
    to determine the sequence of database schema updates or configuration changes
    required during migration. The method ensures that each version in the returned
    vector is unique and follows a logical progression, making it suitable for automated
    migration processes. It assumes valid version strings and handles the internal
    logic of determining the correct path between versions.
  parameters:
  - name: fromVersion
    description: The starting version string from which migration begins. Must be
      a valid semantic version identifier (e.g., '1.0.0', '2.1.3').
  - name: toVersion
    description: The target version string to which migration should proceed. Must
      be a valid semantic version identifier and greater than or equal to fromVersion.
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing the ordered sequence of version strings
    representing the migration path. Each element in the vector corresponds to an
    intermediate version that must be processed in order to reach the target version.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "std::vector<std::string> versions = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetVersionSequence(\"\
      1.0.0\", \"2.0.0\");\nfor (const auto& version : versions) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Migrating to: \" << version << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with version validation
    code: "std::string startVer = \"1.2.0\";\nstd::string endVer = \"3.0.0\";\nstd::vector<std::string>\
      \ sequence = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetVersionSequence(startVer, endVer);\n\
      if (!sequence.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Migration path contains \" << sequence.size()\
      \ << \" steps.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No migration required\
      \ or invalid versions provided.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to work with semantic versioning conventions. The
    internal implementation likely uses a predefined mapping of version transitions
    and may cache results for performance. It does not perform actual migration operations;
    it only determines the sequence of versions that need to be processed.
  warnings: Ensure that both fromVersion and toVersion are valid semantic version
    strings. Passing malformed version strings may lead to undefined behavior or empty
    return vectors. The method assumes that all intermediate versions between fromVersion
    and toVersion exist in the migration system.
