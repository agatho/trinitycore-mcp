documentation:
  brief: Logs a guild event to the guild's event log with specified details including
    player GUIDs and rank.
  description: The _LogEvent method records specific guild-related activities in the
    guild's event log. It tracks events such as member promotions, demotions, joins,
    and leaves by storing the event type, involved player identifiers, and the new
    rank (if applicable). This functionality supports guild management features like
    audit trails and historical tracking of guild membership changes. The method is
    typically invoked internally by other guild operations to maintain a complete
    history of guild activities.
  parameters:
  - name: eventType
    description: The type of guild event being logged, defined by GuildEventLogTypes
      enumeration. Examples include GUILD_EVENT_LOG_PROMOTION, GUILD_EVENT_LOG_DEMOTION,
      GUILD_EVENT_LOG_MEMBER_REMOVED, etc.
  - name: playerGuid1
    description: The GUID of the first player involved in the event (e.g., the player
      performing the action or being acted upon).
  - name: playerGuid2
    description: The GUID of the second player involved in the event (e.g., the target
      player when applicable, such as a promoted member).
  - name: newRank
    description: The new rank level assigned to a player during promotion or demotion
      events. Zero indicates no rank change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Logging a Promotion Event
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      guild->_LogEvent(GUILD_EVENT_LOG_PROMOTION, player1Guid, player2Guid, 3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging a Member Removal Event
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      guild->_LogEvent(GUILD_EVENT_LOG_MEMBER_REMOVED, player1Guid, player2Guid, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function used by the Guild class to maintain
    event logs. It does not directly interact with database persistence but rather
    prepares data for logging which may be flushed to storage later. Developers should
    ensure proper event types are used from the GuildEventLogTypes enumeration.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless implementing custom guild logic.
    Incorrect usage of event types or GUIDs can lead to inconsistent guild history
    records. Ensure that player GUIDs correspond to valid players in the current context.
