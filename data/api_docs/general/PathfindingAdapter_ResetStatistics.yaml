  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: ResetStatistics
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all internal statistics tracking for the pathfinding adapter.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and initializes all accumulated statistical
    data within the PathfindingAdapter class. This includes resetting counters, timers,
    and any performance metrics that have been tracked since the last reset or initialization.
    The method is typically invoked to prepare the adapter for a new phase of pathfinding
    operations or to clear stale data that may affect accuracy in subsequent calculations.
    It ensures that statistics are accurate and relevant only to the current operational
    context.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      // ... perform some pathfinding operations ...

      adapter.ResetStatistics(); // Reset all collected statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or before significant pathfinding
    sessions to ensure accurate statistical reporting. It does not affect the core
    functionality of the pathfinding algorithm itself, only the tracking mechanisms.
