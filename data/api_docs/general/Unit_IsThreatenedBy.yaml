documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is threatened by another unit's attacks.
  description: This method checks if the current unit is being attacked by a specific
    unit, returning true if the unit is under threat from that particular attacker.
    It is commonly used in combat scenarios to determine if a unit is actively being
    targeted or attacked by another unit. The method evaluates the threat level and
    behavior of the unit's attack relationship with the specified unit. This functionality
    is essential for determining combat status and managing threat dynamics within
    the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is threatened by the specified unit, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsThreatenedBy(targetUnit)) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with threat management systems
    and combat logic. It may be affected by various game mechanics such as threat
    generation, aggro, and combat states.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining combat status
    without understanding of how threat works in the game. It's important to note
    that this method does not necessarily reflect the full threat level, but rather
    whether a unit is actively being attacked by another.
