  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CalculateStatBudgetUsed
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateStatBudgetUsed(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the stat budget used by a specific loot item in the
    LootAnalysis system.
  description: The CalculateStatBudgetUsed method determines how much of the available
    stat budget is consumed by a given loot item. This method is typically used within
    the context of loot analysis systems to evaluate item value and distribution efficiency.
    It takes into account various item properties such as stats, quality, and level
    to compute a normalized budget usage value. The result helps in understanding
    how much resource allocation an item represents relative to the total available
    budget.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the stat budget consumed by the specified loot
    item. This value typically ranges from 0.0 (no budget used) to 1.0 (full budget
    used), though exact bounds may vary based on implementation details and item characteristics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootAnalysis analysis;

      LootItem item;

      // Assume item is properly initialized with valid data

      float budgetUsed = analysis.CalculateStatBudgetUsed(item);

      printf("Budget used: %.2f\n", budgetUsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on item stats, quality levels,
    and other properties to determine budget allocation. It may involve internal lookups
    or computations that could impact performance if called frequently in tight loops.
