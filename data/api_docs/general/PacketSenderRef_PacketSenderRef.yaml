  class: PacketSenderRef
  method: PacketSenderRef
  signature: void PacketSenderRef::PacketSenderRef(const int * message)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PacketSenderRef object with the provided message identifier.
  description: The PacketSenderRef constructor initializes a reference to a packet
    sender using the specified message identifier. This method sets up internal state
    for managing packet transmission within the TrinityCore framework. The message
    parameter typically represents a unique identifier for a specific type of game
    packet or communication channel. This constructor is commonly used when establishing
    network communication sessions or preparing packet handlers for sending data to
    clients. The initialization process ensures proper setup of sender references
    before any packet transmission operations can occur.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the message identifier. This value
      typically corresponds to a specific packet type or communication protocol within
      the TrinityCore network layer. Must not be null and should reference a valid
      message ID constant.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PacketSenderRef Initialization
    code: 'int messageId = 1234;

      PacketSenderRef sender(&messageId);

      // Initializes a packet sender reference with message ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Game Packet Constants
    code: '#include "WorldPacket.h"

      int packetType = SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT;

      PacketSenderRef sender(&packetType);

      // Initializes sender for update object packets'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore networking
    subsystem. Developers should ensure that the message identifier points to a valid
    packet type defined in the game's protocol. The reference is usually managed automatically
    by the framework, but understanding its initialization helps with debugging network
    communication issues.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the message parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all message identifiers are properly validated
    against known packet types before passing them to this constructor. This method
    should not be called directly in most game logic scenarios as it's usually part
    of internal networking infrastructure.
