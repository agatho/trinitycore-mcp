  class: Aura
  method: _ApplyForTarget
  signature: void Aura::_ApplyForTarget(Unit * target, Unit * caster, AuraApplication
    * auraApp)
documentation:
  brief: Applies an aura to a target unit, associating it with a specific caster and
    aura application context.
  description: The _ApplyForTarget method is responsible for applying an aura effect
    to a specified target unit within the TrinityCore framework. It takes into account
    the caster who applied the aura, as well as the specific aura application instance
    that defines how the aura should be handled. This method is typically invoked
    during aura application logic and ensures proper integration of the aura's effects
    into the target's state. The method handles internal setup such as updating unit
    auras, triggering relevant events, and managing aura application flags. It plays
    a crucial role in the game's spell and effect system where buffs, debuffs, and
    other magical effects are applied to players or creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the aura effect. Must
      be a valid unit instance; null pointers will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is applying the aura. Can be null
      in certain special cases, but typically represents the source of the spell or
      effect.
  - name: auraApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that defines how this aura
      should be applied and managed on the target. Must not be null for normal operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application
    code: 'Aura* aura = new Aura(caster, target, spellInfo);

      AuraApplication* auraApp = new AuraApplication(target, caster, aura);

      aura->_ApplyForTarget(target, caster, auraApp);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying a Buff Aura to Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Unit* caster = ...; // Get caster reference

      Aura* buffAura = new Aura(caster, player, spellInfo);

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(player, caster, buffAura);

      buffAura->_ApplyForTarget(player, caster, app);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura management system and should not
    be called directly from outside core systems unless you are implementing custom
    aura logic. The method modifies the target's aura list and may trigger various
    callbacks or events depending on the aura type. It assumes that all parameters
    are valid and properly initialized before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both target and auraApp are valid before calling.
    Do not call this method directly during aura removal or destruction phases as
    it may cause inconsistencies in the aura application state.
