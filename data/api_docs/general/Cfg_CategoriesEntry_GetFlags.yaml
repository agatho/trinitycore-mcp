  class: Cfg_CategoriesEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int Cfg_CategoriesEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the configuration category entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer representing the bitmask of
    flags configured for a specific Cfg_CategoriesEntry. These flags typically define
    various behavioral or functional properties of the configuration category, such
    as whether it's enabled, hidden, or has special permissions. The returned value
    can be used in bitwise operations to check for specific flag states. This method
    is commonly used within TrinityCore's configuration system to determine how categories
    should be handled during runtime processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this configuration
    category entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific flag, allowing
    bitwise checks to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a specific flag is set
    code: "Cfg_CategoriesEntry* entry = sConfigMgr->GetCategoryEntry(123);\nif (entry\
      \ && (entry->GetFlags() & CONFIG_FLAG_ENABLED)) {\n    // Category is enabled\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining multiple flag checks
    code: "Cfg_CategoriesEntry* entry = sConfigMgr->GetCategoryEntry(456);\nint flags\
      \ = entry->GetFlags();\nif ((flags & CONFIG_FLAG_ENABLED) && !(flags & CONFIG_FLAG_HIDDEN))\
      \ {\n    // Category is enabled and visible\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a simple getter operation and does not involve any expensive
    computations or I/O operations. It's safe to call from any thread context where
    the Cfg_CategoriesEntry object is valid. The returned flag values are defined
    by the configuration system and should be referenced against known constants like
    CONFIG_FLAG_ENABLED, CONFIG_FLAG_HIDDEN, etc.
  warnings: Ensure that the Cfg_CategoriesEntry pointer is not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Bitwise operations on the returned value
    assume knowledge of the flag definitions used in the TrinityCore configuration
    system.
