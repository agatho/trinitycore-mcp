  class: ProfessionManager
  method: ProcessCraftingQueue
  signature: void ProfessionManager::ProcessCraftingQueue(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the crafting queue for a player, updating the state of ongoing
    crafts based on elapsed time.
  description: The ProcessCraftingQueue method handles the progression of crafting
    activities within the game world. It is typically called periodically by the core
    loop to advance the completion status of items being crafted by players. The method
    updates the crafting progress, checks for completion conditions, and triggers
    appropriate events or notifications when a craft finishes. This function ensures
    that crafting mechanics behave realistically with respect to time-based progression
    and player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the system. Used to locate the specific player's crafting queue for processing.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since the last call to this method.
      Determines how much time has passed and thus how much progress should be made
      in ongoing crafts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    int playerId = 12345;\n    uint32 deltaTime = 1000;\
      \ // One second\n    sProfessionManager->ProcessCraftingQueue(&playerId, deltaTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Update System
    code: "class PlayerUpdateSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdatePlayer(int playerId,\
      \ uint32 diff)\n    {\n        // Other player updates...\n        sProfessionManager->ProcessCraftingQueue(&playerId,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from within the main game update loop and
    must be called consistently to maintain accurate crafting progress. It assumes
    that the player pointer points to a valid player object with an active crafting
    queue. The diff parameter should reflect actual elapsed time for realistic progression.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the diff value can cause crafting to progress too
    fast or too slow, leading to unbalanced gameplay. Ensure that the player pointer
    is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
