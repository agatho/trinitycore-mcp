  brief: Initializes a new ArenaProfile instance with default values
  description: The ArenaProfile constructor initializes a new arena profile object,
    setting up internal data structures and default values for arena-related statistics
    and settings. This method is typically called when creating a new player arena
    profile or when resetting an existing profile to its initial state. The constructor
    ensures that all arena-specific data members are properly initialized with sensible
    defaults, including match statistics, rating information, and team composition
    data. It does not perform any database operations or external API calls; instead,
    it focuses on internal object initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ArenaProfile instance
    code: 'ArenaProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default values

      uint32 rating = profile.GetRating(); // Returns default rating value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing ArenaProfile in a player context
    code: "class Player {\npublic:\n    ArenaProfile arenaProfile;\n    \n    void\
      \ InitializeArenaData() {\n        // Constructor automatically called during\
      \ object creation\n        arenaProfile = ArenaProfile(); // Explicit constructor\
      \ call\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor that performs minimal initialization. The actual
    arena data population typically occurs through database loading or subsequent
    method calls. Developers should be aware that calling this constructor does not
    automatically populate the profile with player-specific data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor directly without proper context,
    as it only initializes default values and does not load existing player data from
    the database. Ensure proper initialization order in object construction sequences.
