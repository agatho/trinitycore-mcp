  method: CallScriptProcHandlers
  signature: bool Aura::CallScriptProcHandlers(const AuraApplication * aurApp, ProcEventInfo
    & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all script-based proc handlers associated with the aura for processing
    triggered effects.
  description: The CallScriptProcHandlers method is responsible for executing all
    script-defined proc handlers that are registered with an aura. This method is
    typically called when a proc event occurs, allowing custom logic defined in scripts
    to be executed in response to the aura's trigger. It ensures that any procedural
    effects or modifications specified by script handlers are properly applied. The
    method takes an AuraApplication object and a ProcEventInfo structure as parameters,
    which provide context about the triggering event and the application state of
    the aura. This function is crucial for implementing custom spell behaviors and
    effects that go beyond standard aura mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the current application
      state of the aura. This provides context about how the aura is applied to a
      target.
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Reference to a ProcEventInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the proc event that triggered this call, including source, target, and
      event type.
  returns: Returns true if at least one script proc handler was successfully executed,
    or false if no handlers were found or all handlers failed to execute.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura proc handling
    code: "bool result = aura->CallScriptProcHandlers(auraApp, eventInfo);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // At least one script handler was executed\n    // Custom proc logic\
      \ has been applied\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom aura effect
    code: "void CustomAuraEffect::HandleProc(AuraApplication const* aurApp, ProcEventInfo&\
      \ eventInfo)\n{\n    // Perform standard aura proc logic\n    if (CallScriptProcHandlers(aurApp,\
      \ eventInfo))\n    {\n        // Additional script-based effects processed\n\
      \        // Apply custom modifications or triggers\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura's internal proc handling system and should
    only be called when a proc event is actually triggered. It does not perform any
    validation on input parameters beyond basic null checks. The method may be invoked
    multiple times during a single proc event depending on how many script handlers
    are registered with the aura.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or before verifying that a
    proc should occur can lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that aurApp and eventInfo
    contain valid data before invoking this method. Avoid calling it recursively as
    it may cause stack overflow in extreme cases.
