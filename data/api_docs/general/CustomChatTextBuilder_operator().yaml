documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a chat packet sender for the specified locale.
  description: The operator() method of CustomChatTextBuilder is used to obtain a
    ChatPacketSender instance that is configured for a specific locale. This allows
    for proper localization of chat messages within the TrinityCore framework. The
    method takes no parameters and returns a pointer to a ChatPacketSender object,
    which can then be used to send localized chat messages to players. The locale
    parameter determines how the chat text will be formatted and translated for the
    target audience. This is particularly important in a multi-language game environment
    where messages need to be displayed correctly based on the player's language settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ChatPacketSender object configured for the specified locale.
    Returns nullptr if the locale is invalid or if no sender could be created for
    that locale.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CustomChatTextBuilder builder;\nChatPacketSender* sender = builder[LOCALE_en];\n\
      if (sender)\n{\n    // Use sender to send localized chat message\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Localized Message
    code: "CustomChatTextBuilder builder;\nChatPacketSender* sender = builder[LOCALE_ko];\n\
      if (sender)\n{\n    WorldPacket packet(CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE);\n    sender->SendPacket(&packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore chat system to
    prepare localized messages for transmission. The returned ChatPacketSender should
    not be deleted manually as it's managed by the builder class. Ensure that the
    locale constant passed to this method is valid and supported by the game client.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the returned ChatPacketSender pointer after the
    CustomChatTextBuilder object has been destroyed, as this may lead to undefined
    behavior. Always check for null return values before using the sender object.
