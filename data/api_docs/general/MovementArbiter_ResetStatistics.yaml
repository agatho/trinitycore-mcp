documentation:
  brief: Resets all movement-related statistics tracked by the MovementArbiter instance.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and initializes all internal counters,
    timers, and performance metrics related to movement handling within the MovementArbiter.
    This method is typically invoked during server resets, player logout, or when
    transitioning between different game states to ensure accurate tracking of movement
    data. It ensures that subsequent movement calculations start with clean state
    values, preventing potential accumulation of stale data that could affect gameplay
    mechanics or performance monitoring.

  - title: Resetting Movement Statistics on Player Logout
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    if (MovementArbiter* arbiter\

      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect ongoing movement
    analysis or performance monitoring. It's recommended to call this only during
    appropriate transition points in the game lifecycle such as player logout, zone
    changes, or server maintenance periods.
