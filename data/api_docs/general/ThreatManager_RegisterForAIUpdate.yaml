  class: ThreatManager
  method: RegisterForAIUpdate
  signature: void ThreatManager::RegisterForAIUpdate(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a creature or unit with the threat manager for AI update processing.
  description: The RegisterForAIUpdate method is used to add a specific unit (typically
    a creature) to the threat manager's list of entities that require periodic AI
    updates. This ensures that the unit's threat generation and management behaviors
    are properly handled by the AI system. The method takes a GUID parameter which
    uniquely identifies the unit within the game world. This registration is essential
    for units that need to maintain threat lists, process aggro behavior, or participate
    in combat-related AI logic. Units must be registered before they can effectively
    engage in combat or generate threat.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit to register for AI updates.
      This should be a valid GUID representing a creature or NPC within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unit Registration
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Register this creature for AI updates\n\
      \    threatManager->RegisterForAIUpdate(GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registration in Combat Initialization
    code: "void CreatureAI::InitializeCombat()\n{\n    // Ensure the creature is registered\
      \ for threat management\n    if (!IsRegisteredForAIUpdate())\n    {\n      \
      \  threatManager->RegisterForAIUpdate(GetGUID());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during unit initialization or when
    the unit becomes active in combat. The registration process is lightweight but
    essential for proper threat management behavior. Units that are not registered
    will not participate in threat calculations or aggro mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure the GUID refers to a valid unit before calling
    this method.
