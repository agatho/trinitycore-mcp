  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float VendorInteractionManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the vendor interaction
    manager.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a measurement of the computational
    load imposed by the VendorInteractionManager on the system's CPU. This value is
    typically expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0
    indicates no CPU usage and 100.0 represents maximum possible usage. The method
    is designed to help developers monitor performance bottlenecks related to vendor
    interactions within the TrinityCore framework. It may aggregate data from multiple
    internal timers or counters to produce an averaged or instantaneous CPU utilization
    metric.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU usage percentage of the VendorInteractionManager,
    ranging from 0.0 (no usage) to 100.0 (maximum usage).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VendorInteractionManager* vendorMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetVendorInteractionManager();

      float cpuUsage = vendorMgr->GetCPUUsage();

      printf("Current CPU usage: %.2f%%\n", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using high-resolution timers or performance
    counters to measure actual CPU time consumed by the manager's operations. It may
    be called frequently in performance-critical sections of code, so developers should
    consider caching results if repeated calls are necessary.
