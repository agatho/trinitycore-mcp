documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is too low level for the player to accept.
  description: The IsQuestTooLowLevel method evaluates whether a given quest is below
    the player's current level threshold, making it ineligible for acceptance. This
    check is typically performed during quest interaction to prevent players from
    taking quests that are not appropriate for their character level. The method considers
    the minimum required level specified in the quest data and compares it against
    the player's actual level. If the quest's minimum level requirement exceeds the
    player's current level, this method returns true, indicating the quest is too
    low level for the player to accept.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest's minimum level requirement exceeds the player's
    current level, indicating the quest is too low level for the player. Returns false
    if the quest can be accepted by the player based on level requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest acceptance logic
    code: "if (questManager.IsQuestTooLowLevel(quest)) {\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      This quest is too low level for you.\");\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with\
      \ quest acceptance logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the player's current level stored in the QuestManager
    instance to perform the comparison. The check may be part of a larger validation
    system that ensures quest eligibility before allowing quest acceptance or progression.
