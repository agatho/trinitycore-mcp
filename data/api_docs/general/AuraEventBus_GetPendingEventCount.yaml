  class: AuraEventBus
  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 AuraEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending aura events in the event bus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the current count of aura
    events that are queued for processing within the AuraEventBus. This count represents
    events that have been scheduled but not yet executed, typically used for debugging,
    performance monitoring, or ensuring proper event handling during aura application
    and removal. The method is thread-safe and provides a snapshot of the pending
    event queue at the time of invocation. It does not modify any internal state and
    can be called at any point during the game loop or aura lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of pending aura events currently
    queued in the AuraEventBus. Returns zero if no events are pending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Pending Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = auraEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"aura\", \"Pending aura events: {}\", pendingCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Debugging with Event Count
    code: "uint32 initialCount = auraEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\n// ... perform\
      \ some aura operations ...\nuint32 finalCount = auraEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\n\
      if (finalCount > initialCount)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"aura\", \"Event queue grew\
      \ from {} to {}\", initialCount, finalCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only snapshot of the event queue and should not
    be used for control flow decisions. The returned count may change immediately
    after the call if other threads are processing events concurrently. For high-frequency
    monitoring, consider caching results or using a dedicated event logging system.
  warnings: Do not assume that a zero return value means no events will occur in the
    future; events can be added to the queue immediately after this method returns.
    Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical code paths as it
    may involve locking mechanisms internally.
