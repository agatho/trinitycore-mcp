  method: UpdateEssenceManagement
  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateEssenceManagement(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages essence resource allocation and usage for Evoker AI during combat.
  description: The UpdateEssenceManagement method is responsible for handling the
    internal logic of how an Evoker AI character manages its essence resources. This
    includes determining when to spend essence for spells, managing cooldowns, and
    prioritizing abilities based on combat state and target conditions. The method
    evaluates the current game state, including available essence, target health,
    and spell readiness, to make strategic decisions about essence expenditure. It
    is typically called during the AI's update cycle to ensure optimal resource utilization
    throughout combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target's ID or index.
      Used to determine targeting priority and essence allocation for abilities that
      require specific targets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Management Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateEssenceManagement(int* target)\n{\n    if (GetEssence()\
      \ >= 50 && *target != 0)\n    {\n        CastSpellOnTarget(SpellId::EssenceBurst,\
      \ *target);\n        ConsumeEssence(50);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Essence Management with Priority Logic
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateEssenceManagement(int* target)\n{\n    if (GetTargetHealth(*target)\
      \ < 30 && GetEssence() >= 75)\n    {\n        CastSpellOnTarget(SpellId::EternalFlame,\
      \ *target);\n        ConsumeEssence(75);\n    }\n    else if (GetEssence() >=\
      \ 25)\n    {\n        CastSpellOnTarget(SpellId::SunderingBlast, *target);\n\
      \        ConsumeEssence(25);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's core AI decision-making system and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. The target parameter must point to
    a valid target ID or index; otherwise, behavior may be undefined. Implementation
    assumes that essence management logic is tied to specific spell cooldowns and
    target conditions.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the target pointer can lead to invalid memory access
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the target value points to a valid combatant
    before calling this method. This function does not perform bounds checking on
    essence values, so callers should validate resource availability.
