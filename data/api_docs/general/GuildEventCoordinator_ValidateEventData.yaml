  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: ValidateEventData
  signature: bool GuildEventCoordinator::ValidateEventData(const GuildEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity and correctness of guild event data before processing.
  description: The ValidateEventData method performs comprehensive checks on a GuildEvent
    object to ensure all required fields are properly populated and within acceptable
    ranges. It verifies that event types, timestamps, participant counts, and other
    critical data elements conform to expected formats and business rules. This validation
    is essential for maintaining data consistency within the guild event system and
    preventing invalid events from being processed or stored in the database. The
    method returns true if all validations pass, or false if any field fails its respective
    check.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GuildEvent object to validate. This parameter must be a valid
      GuildEvent instance with populated fields for type, timestamp, and required
      metadata.
  returns: True if all validation checks pass successfully, false otherwise. Validation
    failures may occur due to invalid event types, missing or malformed data, incorrect
    timestamps, or out-of-range values in any field.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Validation
    code: "GuildEvent testEvent;\ntestEvent.type = GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_WEEKLY;\ntestEvent.timestamp\
      \ = time(nullptr);\ntestEvent.participantCount = 10;\nbool isValid = coordinator.ValidateEventData(testEvent);\n\
      if (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with event processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation with Error Handling
    code: "GuildEvent invalidEvent;\ninvalidEvent.type = static_cast<GuildEventType>(999);\
      \ // Invalid type\ninvalidEvent.timestamp = 0; // Invalid timestamp\ninvalidEvent.participantCount\
      \ = -5; // Negative count\n\nif (!coordinator.ValidateEventData(invalidEvent))\
      \ {\n    // Handle validation failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"guild\", \"Guild event\
      \ validation failed for invalid data\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any guild event is persisted to the database
    or processed by other systems. The validation logic may evolve over time as new
    event types are added or business rules change. Developers should ensure that
    all GuildEvent fields are properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or partially initialized GuildEvent
    object may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect validation results. Always
    ensure the event object is fully populated before validation.
