  brief: Sends updated arena team statistics to all online members
  description: The NotifyStatsChanged method is responsible for broadcasting updated
    arena team statistics to all currently online members of the arena team. This
    method ensures that all players in the team receive real-time updates about their
    team's performance metrics, including rating, wins, losses, and match history.
    The notification mechanism typically involves sending update packets through the
    player's connection to maintain synchronization between server state and client
    displays. This method is automatically invoked when arena team statistics are
    modified, such as after a match result is processed or when team membership changes
    occur.

  - title: Basic Usage After Match Result
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(teamId);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->NotifyStatsChanged();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the serialization and transmission of arena
    team data to all connected players. It's designed to be called after any modification
    to team statistics to ensure clients receive timely updates. The method may perform
    optimizations to avoid sending redundant notifications when multiple changes occur
    in quick succession.
