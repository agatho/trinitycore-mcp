  class: BotActionResult
  method: Failure
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionResult::Failure(const std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new BotActionResult instance indicating failure with
    the specified error message.
  description: The Failure method is a static factory method that constructs and returns
    a BotActionResult object representing a failed operation. It takes an error message
    as input and encapsulates this information within the returned result object.
    This method is typically used in bot AI logic to communicate that a specific action
    or command could not be completed successfully. The returned BotActionResult can
    then be used by calling code to determine whether the operation succeeded or failed,
    and to retrieve the associated error details for logging or user feedback. This
    method does not modify any existing state and is purely a construction utility.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: A constant reference to a std::string containing the descriptive
      error message explaining why the operation failed. This string will be stored
      within the returned BotActionResult object for later retrieval.
  returns: Returns a new BotActionResult instance that represents a failure state
    with the provided error message. The returned object can be inspected to determine
    if the operation failed and to access the specific error details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Failure method
    code: "BotActionResult result = BotActionResult::Failure(\"Invalid target specified\"\
      );\nif (!result.IsSuccess()) {\n    std::cout << \"Operation failed: \" << result.GetError()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Failure in bot command handling
    code: "bool HandleMoveCommand(const std::string& target) {\n    if (target.empty())\
      \ {\n        BotActionResult::Failure(\"Target cannot be empty\");\n       \
      \ return false;\n    }\n    // ... rest of command logic\n    return true;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be a static factory function and should not be
    called on an existing instance. The error message passed to this method is copied
    into the returned BotActionResult object, so modifications to the original string
    after calling this method will not affect the result. This method is thread-safe
    as it only creates and returns a new object without modifying any shared state.
  warnings: Ensure that the error message provided is meaningful and helpful for debugging
    purposes. Since this is a factory method, calling it repeatedly with different
    error messages will create multiple distinct BotActionResult objects, which may
    impact memory usage if not managed properly in high-frequency scenarios.
