  method: GetManagerCount
  signature: size_t ManagerRegistry::GetManagerCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of registered managers within the ManagerRegistry
    instance.
  description: The GetManagerCount method provides a way to retrieve the current count
    of registered managers stored in the ManagerRegistry. This method is typically
    used for monitoring, debugging, or ensuring proper initialization of subsystems
    that depend on manager registration. The returned value represents the total number
    of managers currently managed by this registry instance, which can be useful for
    verifying system state or implementing conditional logic based on manager availability.
    This method performs a simple read operation and does not modify any internal
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of managers currently registered
    in the ManagerRegistry. Returns zero if no managers are registered, or a positive
    integer indicating the total count of registered managers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Manager Count
    code: "ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();\nsize_t count\
      \ = registry.GetManagerCount();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Found %zu managers\
      \ in registry\\n\", count);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No managers registered\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Manager Count for System Validation
    code: "void ValidateManagerRegistry()\n{\n    ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();\n\
      \    size_t managerCount = registry.GetManagerCount();\n    \n    // Ensure\
      \ minimum required managers are present\n    if (managerCount < 1)\n    {\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Critical: No managers registered in registry!\");\n\
      \        // Handle error condition\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Registry contains %zu managers\", managerCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without synchronization
    concerns. The performance impact is minimal as it typically involves a simple
    atomic read operation or lock-free access to an internal counter. This method
    does not perform any expensive operations like iteration or computation.
  warnings: While this method returns a count, it's important to note that the value
    may change between when you retrieve it and when you use it in conditional logic,
    especially if other threads are registering or unregistering managers concurrently.
    For critical sections where consistency is required, consider using appropriate
    locking mechanisms.
