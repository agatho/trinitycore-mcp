  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: SetOptimizationInterval
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::SetOptimizationInterval(uint32_t ms)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the optimization interval in milliseconds for the performance optimizer.
  description: The SetOptimizationInterval method configures how frequently the PerformanceOptimizer
    will perform its optimization routines. This interval determines the cadence at
    which system resources are evaluated and optimized, affecting overall server performance
    and resource utilization. The method accepts a time interval in milliseconds,
    with higher values reducing CPU overhead but potentially delaying optimization
    benefits. This setting is crucial for balancing server responsiveness with performance
    overhead.
  parameters:
  - name: ms
    description: The optimization interval in milliseconds. Valid values are typically
      in the range of 100 to 60000 (100ms to 60 seconds). Values outside this range
      may cause unexpected behavior or performance degradation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetOptimizationInterval(5000); // Set interval to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: 'uint32_t interval = 10000; // 10 seconds

      PerformanceOptimizer::GetSingleton().SetOptimizationInterval(interval);

      // This reduces optimization frequency to minimize CPU overhead during peak
      hours'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the timing of internal performance optimization
    cycles. The interval should be tuned based on server load and performance requirements.
    Lower intervals provide more responsive optimization but increase CPU usage.
  warnings: Setting the interval too low (e.g., below 100ms) may cause excessive CPU
    overhead and potential performance degradation. Setting it too high may delay
    necessary optimizations, leading to suboptimal server performance.
