  method: GenerateGuildId
  signature: int GuildMgr::GenerateGuildId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique identifier for a new guild within the TrinityCore
    server instance.
  description: The GenerateGuildId method is responsible for creating a unique identification
    number for each newly created guild in the World of Warcraft server. This function
    ensures that no two guilds share the same ID, which is essential for maintaining
    data integrity and proper guild management throughout the game world. The generated
    ID is typically used as a primary key in database entries related to guilds. It's
    important to note that this method likely interacts with an internal counter or
    database sequence to guarantee uniqueness across all guilds on the server. This
    function should be called prior to creating a new guild entry in the database
    to assign it a valid, unique identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the newly generated unique guild
    identifier. The return value is guaranteed to be positive and unique within the
    context of the current server instance. In case of failure or system error, this
    method may return zero or a negative value, though such scenarios are typically
    handled internally by the framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GuildMgr* guildManager = GuildMgr::instance();\nint newGuildId = guildManager->GenerateGuildId();\n\
      if (newGuildId > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with creating the guild using this ID\n\
      \    // ... guild creation logic ...\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's part of a singleton manager class.
    It may utilize atomic operations or locking mechanisms to ensure that concurrent
    guild creations do not result in duplicate IDs. The implementation probably involves
    either incrementing an internal counter or querying the database for the next
    available sequential ID.
  warnings: Do not call this method without proper initialization of the GuildMgr
    singleton. Repeated calls should be made only when actually creating new guilds,
    as each invocation consumes a unique identifier that cannot be reused.
