  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: TriggerAutomaticRecovery
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::TriggerAutomaticRecovery(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers automatic health recovery process for a specified bot character.
  description: The TriggerAutomaticRecovery method initiates the health restoration
    procedure for a bot identified by its GUID. This function is typically invoked
    when a bot's health falls below a certain threshold or during specific game events
    that require automated healing. The method handles internal logic to determine
    recovery actions, such as using health potions, invoking healing spells, or restoring
    health through other in-game mechanisms. It operates within the context of the
    TrinityCore framework and assumes proper initialization of bot AI components.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which automatic
      recovery is to be triggered. Must correspond to a valid active bot in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      healthCheck.TriggerAutomaticRecovery(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthCheck;\nuint32 botGuid = 12345;\nif (sObjectMgr->GetPlayer(botGuid))\
      \ {\n    healthCheck.TriggerAutomaticRecovery(botGuid);\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid bot GUID: %u\", botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on bots that are properly initialized and
    registered within the TrinityCore system. The recovery process may involve multiple
    internal steps including spell casting, item usage, or AI decision-making which
    can affect performance if invoked too frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot exists and is active before
    invoking this function.
