documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic reagent restocking for NPC interactions.
  description: The SetAutoRestockReagents method configures whether an NPC will automatically
    restock reagents when a player interacts with it. This functionality is typically
    used in vendor NPCs to ensure that players can purchase reagents without manually
    triggering a restock event. When enabled, the system will automatically replenish
    reagent items based on predefined thresholds or conditions. The setting persists
    for the duration of the NPC's interaction session and may be influenced by player
    permissions or game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Restock Reagents
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      manager->SetAutoRestockReagents(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Restock Reagents
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      manager->SetAutoRestockReagents(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the current NPC interaction session. The auto-restock
    behavior is typically tied to the vendor's inventory management system and may
    be subject to server configuration or expansion-specific rules.
  warnings: Ensure that enabling this feature does not conflict with custom vendor
    logic or cause unexpected inventory behavior in scripted interactions. This setting
    should be applied before initiating any NPC interaction for optimal results.
