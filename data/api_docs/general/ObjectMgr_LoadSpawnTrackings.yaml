documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spawn tracking data for game objects and creatures
    from the database.
  description: The LoadSpawnTrackings method is responsible for loading spawn tracking
    information from the database tables into memory. This functionality enables the
    server to track which game objects and creatures have been spawned in specific
    zones or instances, allowing for proper cleanup, respawn management, and maintaining
    consistency between the database state and the live world. The method typically
    executes during server startup or when reloading spawn data. It processes records
    related to spawn points, instance data, and tracking flags that determine how
    and when entities should be spawned or despawned.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadSpawnTrackings();\n\
      \    // Other loading logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading spawn tracking data. It is not thread-safe and must be executed
    on the main thread. The method assumes that database connections are already established
    and that relevant tables contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate tracking entries or memory leaks. Ensure that no active spawns or instances
    are running when reloading spawn tracking data to avoid inconsistencies.
