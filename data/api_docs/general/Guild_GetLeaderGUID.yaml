  class: Guild
  method: GetLeaderGUID
  signature: int Guild::GetLeaderGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the guild leader player.
  description: The GetLeaderGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the current guild leader. This identifier is used to uniquely identify the player
    character who holds the leadership position within the guild. The method performs
    a simple lookup in the internal guild data structure and returns the stored GUID
    value. It does not perform any validation or checks on whether the returned GUID
    corresponds to an active player in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the guild leader. If the guild has
    no leader (which should not occur under normal circumstances), this method may
    return 0 or an invalid GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve guild leader GUID
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 leaderGuid = myGuild->GetLeaderGUID();\n    if (leaderGuid)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Use the leader GUID to find the player\n        Player* leader\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player, leaderGuid));\n\
      \        if (leader)\n        {\n            // Process leader information\n\
      \            sLog->outString(\"Guild leader is: %s\", leader->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly accesses the internal storage
    of the guild's leader GUID. It should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code paths as it does not perform any caching or lazy loading. The returned value
    is typically used to locate the actual player object using ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer.
  warnings: This method may return 0 if there is no valid leader set for the guild,
    which could indicate an inconsistent state in the guild data. Always validate
    the returned GUID before attempting to use it to access player objects.
