documentation:
  brief: Executes the Druid's area-of-effect spell rotation logic and returns true
    if a target was selected for casting.
  description: The HandleAoERotation method implements the core logic for a Druid
    AI's ability to select and cast area-of-effect spells in combat. This method evaluates
    available targets within the Druid's range, determines the most optimal target
    based on threat, health, or other factors, and executes the appropriate AoE spell
    rotation sequence. It is typically invoked during combat situations where multiple
    enemies are present, allowing the Druid to maximize damage output or utility across
    several foes simultaneously. The method returns true if a valid target was identified
    and processed for casting, otherwise false. This function is part of the Druid's
    AI decision-making system and integrates with the broader combat state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a suitable target was found and an AoE spell was initiated
    or queued for casting; returns false if no valid targets are available or if the
    rotation logic could not be executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "if (druidAI->HandleAoERotation(&targetId)) {\n    // Spell casting initiated\n\
      \    // TargetId contains the GUID of the selected target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Druid AI has already determined it is in a combat
    state and has sufficient mana or resources to cast AoE spells. It may internally
    call other helper methods like GetBestAoETarget() or ExecuteSpell(). The method
    does not directly handle spell cooldowns but relies on the AI's internal state
    management for such checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context without proper validation,
    as it may lead to invalid target selection or failed spell casts. Ensure that
    the Druid AI instance is properly initialized and has valid access to the target
    list before invoking this function.
