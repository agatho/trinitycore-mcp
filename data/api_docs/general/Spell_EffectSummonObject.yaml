  brief: Summon objects using spell effects
  description: This method handles the summoning of objects through spell effects,
    typically used for creating game objects like doors, chests, or other environmental
    elements. It is part of the spell handling system in TrinityCore and operates
    within the context of spell mechanics where the object's position, orientation,
    and duration are determined by the spell's properties and effects. The method
    ensures that summoned objects are properly initialized and added to the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Summon Object Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectSummonObject();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the spell's effect parameters to determine object properties
    such as position, rotation, and duration. It is important to note that this method
    may be called from different threads depending on how the spell is executed.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper spell context;
    it requires valid spell effects to function correctly. Incorrect usage can lead
    to invalid object creation or memory leaks.
