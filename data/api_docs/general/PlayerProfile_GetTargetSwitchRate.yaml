  method: GetTargetSwitchRate
  signature: float PlayerProfile::GetTargetSwitchRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the rate at which a player switches targets during combat.
  description: The GetTargetSwitchRate method retrieves the frequency or probability
    at which a PlayerProfile will switch their current target while engaged in combat.
    This value is typically used by the AI system to determine how aggressively a
    player character will shift focus between enemies. The returned float represents
    a normalized rate, often expressed as a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher
    values indicate more frequent target switching. This method does not take any
    parameters and is read-only, providing a consistent value based on the player's
    profile configuration or game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the target switch rate. Typically ranges from
    0.0 (no target switching) to 1.0 (frequent target switching), though exact bounds
    may depend on implementation details and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float switchRate = playerProfile->GetTargetSwitchRate();\nif (switchRate\
      \ > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Player profile has a high target switching rate\n    //\
      \ This might affect combat behavior or AI decisions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Target Switch Rate for AI Logic
    code: "void UpdateCombatAI(PlayerProfile* profile)\n{\n    float rate = profile->GetTargetSwitchRate();\n\
      \    if (rate > 0.7f)\n    {\n        // Implement aggressive target switching\
      \ logic\n        // e.g., prioritize switching to nearest threat\n    }\n  \
      \  else if (rate < 0.3f)\n    {\n        // Implement focused targeting behavior\n\
      \        // e.g., maintain current target until it's defeated\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerProfile class and likely reflects settings
    or attributes that influence AI-driven combat behavior. It may be influenced by
    player class, gear, talents, or other gameplay modifiers. The value returned should
    be treated as a constant for the duration of a single combat encounter unless
    explicitly modified through game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic relying on this rate value accounts for potential
    edge cases where the rate might be zero or extremely low, which could lead to
    unintended behavior such as locking onto a single target indefinitely. Also, be
    aware that this value may not reflect real-time changes during combat unless updated
    by specific game events.
