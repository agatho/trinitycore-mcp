  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the frost death knight's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core combat logic
    for a frost death knight when engaging a single enemy target. This method determines
    which abilities to cast based on the current state of the player, target, and
    available resources such as runes, energy, and blood power. It typically involves
    managing the death knight's ability cooldowns, rune generation, and optimal spell
    usage to maximize damage output or survivability in single-target scenarios. The
    method assumes that a valid target has been previously selected and passed via
    the target parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the current target. This value must be a valid target within the game world
      or the method may behave unpredictably.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making loop and should be called regularly
    during combat. It relies on internal state tracking of runes, cooldowns, and resource
    management which must be properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit; otherwise, undefined
    behavior may occur. This method modifies internal AI state and should not be invoked
    outside of the proper combat context.
