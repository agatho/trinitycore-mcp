  method: GetFlags
  signature: int PlayerConditionEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with the player condition entry for evaluation
    purposes.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific PlayerConditionEntry. These flags are used by
    the game's condition system to determine how and when certain conditions should
    be evaluated or enforced. The returned value typically combines multiple boolean
    or categorical flags that control various aspects of player behavior, quest progression,
    spell casting restrictions, or other gameplay mechanics tied to the condition.
    This method is commonly invoked during conditional checks within the TrinityCore
    engine to validate whether a player meets specific criteria before allowing actions
    such as quest acceptance, spell casting, or item usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bits for this player condition
    entry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific boolean flag that
    defines how the condition should be interpreted and applied by the game engine.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Player Condition Flags
    code: "PlayerConditionEntry* condition = sObjectMgr->GetPlayerCondition(12345);\n\
      if (condition)\n{\n    int flags = condition->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & PLAYER_CONDITION_FLAG_UNK_0)\n\
      \        // Handle special flag case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of individual flag bits is determined by the TrinityCore
    codebase and may vary between different versions. Developers should consult the
    internal definitions or documentation for specific flag meanings, as these are
    not exposed publicly in the API.
