  brief: Checks if the player has a specific spell in their spell book.
  description: The HasSpell method determines whether a player possesses a particular
    spell in their character's spell book. This method is commonly used to verify
    spell availability, especially when implementing game mechanics that require checking
    if a player has certain abilities or spells. It returns true if the spell exists
    in the player's spell list and false otherwise. The method can be used for various
    purposes including validating spell usage, checking spell availability for quest
    completion, or determining if a player can cast specific spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has the specified spell in their spell book,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Check
    code: "if (player->HasSpell(12345)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Check for Quest Completion
    code: "if (player->HasSpell(87654)) {\n    // Player has the spell required for\
      \ quest completion\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be used in both player and AI contexts.
    Performance considerations are minimal as it simply checks a spell existence in
    the player's spell book without complex operations.
