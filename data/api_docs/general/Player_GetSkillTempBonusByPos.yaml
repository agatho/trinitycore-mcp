documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the temporary bonus value for a specific skill position.
  description: This method returns the temporary bonus applied to a skill at the specified
    position. It is used to access skill bonuses that are not permanently stored,
    such as those from temporary effects or buffs. The method allows players to retrieve
    skill bonuses without needing to know the exact type of bonus, making it useful
    for various game mechanics including skill tracking and bonus calculation. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods to manage
    player skill progression and temporary bonuses.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the temporary bonus value as int16, which can be positive or negative
    depending on the current bonus applied to the skill at the specified position.
    A value of zero indicates no temporary bonus is active for that skill position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int16 bonus = player->GetSkillTempBonusByPos(0);\nif (bonus != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the bonus value\n    // This could be used to apply temporary\
      \ skill bonuses\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the skill management system in TrinityCore and is
    typically used internally by the game engine. The method may return zero if no
    temporary bonus is active for the skill position, which could happen during normal
    gameplay or when bonuses are removed.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return zero even
    when a bonus is expected, particularly in scenarios where skill bonuses are removed
    or reset. Also, this method does not distinguish between different types of temporary
    bonuses and may require additional context to determine the exact source of the
    bonus.
