    requestedObjectMask, const int & requestedItemMask, const Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates player with item data using object and item masks.
  description: This method builds a values update for a player using specified object
    and item masks, allowing the player to see item data in their client. It is used
    internally by TrinityCore to handle item updates during gameplay operations such
    as item creation, modification, or display. The method ensures proper synchronization
    of item data between server and client, particularly when dealing with item properties
    and visual representations.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers that will hold the updated values
      for the player's client. This array must be pre-allocated and large enough to
      contain all relevant data.
  - name: requestedObjectMask
    description: The object mask used to determine which object fields should be included
      in the update. This mask typically represents the object type or field mask
      that controls what data is sent to the player.
  - name: requestedItemMask
    description: The item mask used to determine which item fields should be included
      in the update. This mask controls what item-specific data is sent to the player,
      such as item properties or visual attributes.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the update. This
      parameter determines which player's client receives the item data update and
      ensures proper synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item item;

      int data[100];

      Player* targetPlayer = new Player();

      item.BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(data, objectMask, itemMask, targetPlayer);

      // The player''s client now receives updated item data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to ensure proper synchronization of item data. It is important that the data array
    is large enough to accommodate all fields specified by the masks, otherwise memory
    corruption may occur. Performance considerations include ensuring that the masks
    are properly set for efficient updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of the data array or masks can lead to memory corruption
    or incorrect client behavior. The method assumes that the target player is valid
    and not null, so care must be taken when passing player pointers.
