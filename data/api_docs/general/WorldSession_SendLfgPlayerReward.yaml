documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG player reward packet to the client
  description: The SendLfgPlayerReward method is responsible for transmitting LFG
    (Looking for Group) player reward data to the connected client. This method is
    typically invoked when a player completes a dungeon or quest through the LFG system
    and is eligible for rewards such as experience, gold, or loot. The method serializes
    the provided reward data into a network packet and sends it over the established
    connection. It plays a crucial role in the World of Warcraft's group finding and
    reward distribution mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: lfgPlayerRewardData
    description: A const reference to an LfgPlayerRewardData structure containing
      all relevant reward information for the player, including experience, gold,
      loot items, and any other applicable rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a basic LFG reward
    code: 'lfg::LfgPlayerRewardData rewardData;

      rewardData.experience = 1000;

      rewardData.gold = 5000;

      rewardData.itemCount = 2;

      // ... populate item data

      session->SendLfgPlayerReward(rewardData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system integration and should only be called
    when a player has actually completed an eligible activity. The method assumes
    that the reward data has been properly validated before being sent to avoid client-side
    errors or exploits.
