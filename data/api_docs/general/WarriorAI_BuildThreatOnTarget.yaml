  class: WarriorAI
  method: BuildThreatOnTarget
  signature: void WarriorAI::BuildThreatOnTarget(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Adds threat to the specified target unit for the warrior AI.
  description: The BuildThreatOnTarget method is used by the WarriorAI class to generate
    threat against a specific target unit. This method is typically invoked when the
    warrior needs to establish or increase its aggro level on a particular enemy.
    It directly influences the AI's behavior by ensuring that the warrior focuses
    its attacks on the designated target, which is essential for maintaining proper
    combat mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The method operates
    within the context of the warrior's current combat state and may interact with
    other threat-related systems such as taunt mechanics or threat distribution algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that will receive threat from this warrior
      AI. Must be a valid unit instance; passing nullptr will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Building Example
    code: "void SomeWarriorAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    BuildThreatOnTarget(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Threat Management with Conditional Logic
    code: "void AdvancedWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim()\
      \ && me->GetVictim()->IsAlive())\n    {\n        BuildThreatOnTarget(me->GetVictim());\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Find a new target and build threat on it\n\
      \        Unit* newTarget = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM, 0, 100.0f, true);\n\
      \        if (newTarget)\n        {\n            BuildThreatOnTarget(newTarget);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard warrior AI threat management system and
    integrates with TrinityCore's core threat engine. It should be called carefully
    to avoid excessive or unintended threat generation that could disrupt combat balance.
    The method does not perform any validation on the target parameter, so callers
    must ensure the target is valid before invoking this function.
  warnings: Calling BuildThreatOnTarget with a null pointer will lead to undefined
    behavior and likely crash the server. Additionally, frequent calls without proper
    cooldowns may cause performance issues or unexpected combat behavior in high-density
    encounters.
