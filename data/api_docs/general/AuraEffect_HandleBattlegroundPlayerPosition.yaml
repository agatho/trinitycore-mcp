  method: HandleBattlegroundPlayerPosition
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleBattlegroundPlayerPosition(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles player position updates in battlegrounds for aura effects.
  description: The HandleBattlegroundPlayerPosition method is responsible for managing
    how player positions are updated within battleground environments when specific
    aura effects are applied or removed. This method ensures that the game state accurately
    reflects a player's location and status during battleground events, such as capturing
    objectives or entering restricted zones. It interacts with the AuraApplication
    system to determine whether to apply or remove positional modifiers based on the
    mode parameter and the current state of the aura. The method is typically invoked
    internally by the TrinityCore framework during aura application or removal processes.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter provides context for the current
      aura effect and its associated target.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation. This
      value typically determines how the player position should be handled, such as
      applying a positional restriction or updating a flag state.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag that indicates whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This parameter controls the direction of the operation and
      affects how the player's position is modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura effect handler
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleBattlegroundPlayerPosition(const AuraApplication*\
      \ aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    // Implementation logic here\n\
      \    if (apply) {\n        // Apply position restrictions or flags\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Remove position restrictions or reset flags\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground handling system and should
    not be called directly by external code. It relies on proper initialization of
    the AuraApplication context and assumes valid parameters. The method may perform
    operations that affect player movement, visibility, or interaction with battleground
    elements.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the mode parameter can lead to unexpected behavior
    in battleground mechanics. Ensure that all aura effects that use this method are
    properly configured to avoid conflicts with other battleground systems.
