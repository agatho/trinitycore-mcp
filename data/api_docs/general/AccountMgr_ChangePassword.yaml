    newPassword)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the password for a specified account ID
  description: The ChangePassword method updates the password associated with a given
    account identifier in the TrinityCore database. This function performs validation
    on the new password to ensure it meets security requirements and updates the corresponding
    account record. The operation is typically used during account management or when
    users request a password reset through the game interface or admin tools. It returns
    an AccountOpResult indicating success or failure of the operation, which can be
    used to provide appropriate feedback to the user or log the outcome for administrative
    purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account for which the password needs to
      be changed. Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: newPassword
    description: The new password to set for the specified account. Should follow
      game-defined security policies such as minimum length and character requirements.
  returns: An AccountOpResult enum value indicating whether the password change was
    successful or if an error occurred. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED_ALREADY_EXIST,
    FAILED_NOT_FOUND, FAILED_INVALID_PASSWORD, etc., depending on the outcome of the
    operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Password Change Example
    code: "AccountOpResult result = AccountMgr::ChangePassword(12345, \"NewSecurePass123\"\
      );\nif (result == AccountOpResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Password changed successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Password updated for account 12345\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error based on result code\n    printf(\"Failed to change password: %d\\n\"\
      , result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database transactions and may involve hashing
    the new password before storage. Ensure that the input parameters are sanitized
    to prevent injection attacks or invalid data corruption. The method should be
    called from a context where account access permissions are properly validated.
  warnings: Never expose raw password values in logs or error messages. Always validate
    that the new password meets game security standards (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
    Be cautious of race conditions if multiple threads attempt to modify the same
    account's password simultaneously.
