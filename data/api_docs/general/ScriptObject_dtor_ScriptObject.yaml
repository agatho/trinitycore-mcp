documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ScriptObject instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ScriptObject class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. In the context
    of TrinityCore's scripting system, this typically involves releasing references
    to game objects, unregistering callbacks, or performing other necessary cleanup
    operations. Since ScriptObject serves as a base class for various scripted components
    in the game world, its destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur and that
    the scripting environment remains stable when objects are destroyed. This method
    is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ScriptObject
    code: "class MyScript : public ScriptObject {\npublic:\n    MyScript() {}\n  \
      \  ~MyScript() override {\n        // Cleanup code here\n    }\n};\n\nvoid Function()\
      \ {\n    MyScript* script = new MyScript();\n    // ... use script ...\n   \
      \ delete script; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically virtual in scripting base classes to ensure proper
    cleanup of derived class members. Developers should avoid calling the destructor
    directly unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
