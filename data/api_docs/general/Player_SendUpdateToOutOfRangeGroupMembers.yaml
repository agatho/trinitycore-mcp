documentation:
  brief: Sends updated player data to group members who are currently out of range.
  description: The SendUpdateToOutOfRangeGroupMembers method ensures that player information
    is synchronized with group members who are currently outside the normal update
    range. This method is typically invoked when a player's state changes in a way
    that requires notification to distant group members, such as health updates, buff/debuff
    changes, or other visual state modifications. It handles the logic of identifying
    which group members are out of range and sending appropriate update packets to
    maintain synchronization across the group.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player state change
    code: "void Player::OnHealthChange()\n{\n    // ... health update logic ...\n\
      \    SendUpdateToOutOfRangeGroupMembers();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group synchronization system in TrinityCore. It
    only affects players who are in the same group but currently out of range for
    normal updates. The method does not send updates to players within normal range,
    as those would be handled by regular update mechanisms.
