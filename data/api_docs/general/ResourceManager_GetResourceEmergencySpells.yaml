  method: GetResourceEmergencySpells
  signature: int ResourceManager::GetResourceEmergencySpells()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of emergency spells associated with the resource manager.
  description: The GetResourceEmergencySpells method returns an integer value representing
    the number of emergency spells currently registered within the ResourceManager.
    This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to manage special spell behaviors that activate under specific resource conditions,
    such as when a player's mana or rage reaches critical levels. The method does
    not take any parameters and provides a straightforward count of these emergency
    spells, which may be utilized by the game engine for spell activation logic or
    UI display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of emergency spells managed
    by this ResourceManager instance. Returns zero if no emergency spells are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int emergencySpellsCount = resourceManager->GetResourceEmergencySpells();\n\
      if (emergencySpellsCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle the presence of emergency spells\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d emergency spells\\n\", emergencySpellsCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger resource management system in TrinityCore
    that handles special spell behaviors. It's important to note that the actual implementation
    details may vary depending on how emergency spells are defined and stored within
    the ResourceManager class.
