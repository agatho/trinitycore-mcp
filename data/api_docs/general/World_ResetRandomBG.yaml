  brief: Resets the random battleground queue status for all players in the world.
  description: The ResetRandomBG method clears the random battleground queue state
    for all connected players, effectively removing them from any pending random battleground
    matches. This function is typically invoked during server maintenance or when
    resetting battleground systems to ensure a clean state. It does not affect player
    characters directly but rather manages the internal queue system that handles
    random battleground matchmaking. The method ensures that no stale or invalid queue
    entries remain in the system.

    ongoing matchmaking processes.
