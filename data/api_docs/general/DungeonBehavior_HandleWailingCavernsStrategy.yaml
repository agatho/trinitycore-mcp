  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleWailingCavernsStrategy(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles encounter logic for Wailing Caverns dungeon strategy.
  description: The HandleWailingCavernsStrategy method manages the AI behavior and
    encounter handling specific to the Wailing Caverns dungeon instance. This method
    processes group-based encounters, applies appropriate strategies based on encounter
    ID, and ensures proper mob AI execution within the dungeon environment. It coordinates
    with the group's members to execute combat tactics, manage loot distribution,
    and handle encounter progression according to the dungeon's scripted mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players participating in the
      Wailing Caverns instance. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current encounter within Wailing Caverns.
      Determines which specific strategy and behavior should be applied to handle
      the encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    HandleWailingCavernsStrategy(group, encounterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom dungeon AI
    code: "class WailingCavernsAI : public DungeonBehavior\n{\npublic:\n    void ProcessEncounter(Group*\
      \ group, uint32 encounterId) override\n    {\n        if (encounterId == ENCOUNTER_MORPHAZ)\n\
      \        {\n            HandleWailingCavernsStrategy(group, encounterId);\n\
      \            // Additional custom logic for Morphaz encounter\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the dungeon's AI manager when an encounter
    begins. The method assumes that the group has already been validated and contains
    valid players. It may modify group member states and should be called from a context
    where group synchronization is maintained.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. The encounterId must correspond to known Wailing Caverns
    encounters, otherwise behavior is undefined.
