  class: Unit
  method: TriggerAurasProcOnEvent
  signature: void Unit::TriggerAurasProcOnEvent(ProcEventInfo & eventInfo, AuraApplicationProcContainer
    & procAuras)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers aura proc events based on specified event information and aura applications.
  description: This method processes aura proc events by evaluating the provided ProcEventInfo
    against the AuraApplicationProcContainer. It handles the execution of aura effects
    that are triggered by specific game events, such as damage dealt, healing received,
    or combat actions. The method ensures proper application of aura proc mechanisms
    based on event conditions and can be used in conjunction with other aura-related
    methods for comprehensive event handling.
  parameters:
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Contains information about the event that triggered the aura proc,
      including event type, damage type, and other relevant parameters. This data
      is essential for determining how the aura should be processed.
  - name: procAuras
    description: Represents the container holding aura applications that are eligible
      to trigger based on the event information. This container typically includes
      all active auras that can proc in response to the specified event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      ProcEventInfo eventInfo;

      AuraApplicationProcContainer procAuras;


      // Initialize eventInfo and procAuras with relevant data

      target->TriggerAurasProcOnEvent(eventInfo, procAuras);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      ProcEventInfo eventInfo;

      AuraApplicationProcContainer procAuras;


      // Setup eventInfo with damage type and other parameters

      eventInfo.SetEventType(ProcEventType::DAMAGE);


      // Initialize procAuras with specific aura applications

      procAuras.push_back(_AURA_APPLICATION);


      // Trigger the aura proc event

      target->TriggerAurasProcOnEvent(eventInfo, procAuras);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related methods
    and should be called during specific game events such as damage dealt or received.
    Performance considerations include processing time for event evaluation and aura
    application handling.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect aura proc behavior,
    potentially causing unexpected effects or missing proc triggers. Ensure that eventInfo
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
