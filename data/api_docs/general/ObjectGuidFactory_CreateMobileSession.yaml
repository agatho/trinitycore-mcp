  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateMobileSession
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateMobileSession(uint32 realmId, uint16
    arg1, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a mobile session identifier used in TrinityCore's
    networking and session management.
  description: The CreateMobileSession method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for identifying mobile sessions within the TrinityCore framework. This
    GUID is typically used to track player sessions, client connections, or other
    dynamic entities that require a globally unique identifier across the game world.
    The generated GUID incorporates realm ID, session-specific arguments, and a counter
    value to ensure uniqueness. This method is commonly invoked during client authentication,
    session creation, or when establishing new network connections in the World of
    Warcraft server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the session will be active.
      This value typically corresponds to the realm's ID in the database and helps
      distinguish sessions across different realms.
  - name: arg1
    description: A session-specific argument that provides additional context or identification
      for the mobile session. The exact meaning of this parameter depends on the calling
      code but often represents a client-specific value or connection type identifier.
  - name: counter
    description: A monotonically increasing counter value used to ensure GUID uniqueness.
      This typically increments with each new session creation and helps prevent collisions
      in GUID generation.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies the mobile session.
    The returned GUID contains encoded information about the realm, session arguments,
    and counter to provide a globally unique identifier suitable for use in TrinityCore's
    session management system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for creating a mobile session GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateMobileSession(1, 0x1234, 56789);

      // Creates a unique session GUID for realm ID 1 with argument 0x1234 and counter
      56789'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating mobile session GUID during client connection handling
    code: 'uint32 realmId = sWorld->GetRealmID();

      uint16 sessionId = GetNextSessionId();

      uint64 counter = sObjectMgr->GetNextSessionCounter();

      ObjectGuid sessionGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateMobileSession(realmId, sessionId,
      counter);

      // Used to assign a unique identifier to a new player session'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the authentication process when establishing
    new client connections. The generated GUIDs are designed to be globally unique
    across all realms and sessions. Developers should ensure that the counter parameter
    is properly managed to prevent collisions, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of the counter value can lead to GUID collisions which
    may cause session management issues or unexpected behavior in network communication.
    The realmId should always correspond to a valid realm in the database to avoid
    invalid session identifiers.
