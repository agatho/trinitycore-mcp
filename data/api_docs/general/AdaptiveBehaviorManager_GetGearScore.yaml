  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetGearScore
  signature: float AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetGearScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the gear score of the adaptive behavior manager's
    associated unit.
  description: The GetGearScore method computes the overall item level (gear score)
    for the unit managed by this AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance. This value represents
    the average item level of all equipped items and is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft to determine a character's relative power and progression. The method
    aggregates the item levels from all equipped slots, taking into account enchantments,
    gems, and other modifiers that contribute to the final gear score calculation.
    It provides a single float value that reflects the unit's current equipment strength
    for use in AI decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the computed gear score of the associated unit.
    This value typically ranges from 0.0 (no equipped items) to several hundred depending
    on the item levels and modifiers present on the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float gearScore = behaviorManager.GetGearScore();\nif (gearScore > 500.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is considered high-level\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Gear Scores
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* playerBehavior = GetPlayerBehavior();\nAdaptiveBehaviorManager*\
      \ npcBehavior = GetNPCBehavior();\nfloat playerScore = playerBehavior->GetGearScore();\n\
      float npcScore = npcBehavior->GetGearScore();\n\nif (playerScore > npcScore\
      \ * 1.2f)\n{\n    // Player has significantly better gear\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance considerations when called frequently,
    as it requires iterating through all equipped items and calculating their combined
    item level. The implementation likely caches the result to avoid redundant calculations
    unless equipment changes. This method should only be called on units that have
    valid equipment.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit without any equipped items will return 0.0,
    which may not be the intended behavior in all contexts. Ensure that the unit has
    been properly initialized with equipment before calling this method to avoid misleading
    gear score values.
