documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all quest relations associated with a game object entry.
  description: The GetGOQuestInvolvedRelations method fetches all quest relations
    linked to a specific game object entry from the database. This is used primarily
    in the context of quest system integration where game objects (such as quest givers
    or quest objectives) are tied to specific quests. The returned result set contains
    information about which quests are involved with which game objects, enabling
    proper quest tracking and interaction logic within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during quest initialization or when processing
    quest-related events involving game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestRelationResult object containing all quest relations for the specified
    game object entry. The result set includes mappings between game object entries
    and their associated quest IDs, allowing the system to determine which quests
    are triggered or affected by interactions with that particular game object.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve quest relations for a specific game object
    code: "QuestRelationResult relations = sObjectMgr->GetGOQuestInvolvedRelations(176345);\n\
      for (auto& relation : relations)\n{\n    uint32 questId = relation.questId;\n\
      \    uint32 entry = relation.entry;\n    // Process the quest relation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses database tables that store quest-object relationships.
    It's recommended to cache results when frequently accessed to improve performance.
    The returned QuestRelationResult should be treated as read-only and not modified
    directly.
  warnings: The method may return an empty result set if no quests are associated
    with the given game object entry. Ensure proper error handling when processing
    the returned data, especially in cases where quest relations might be missing
    or invalid.
