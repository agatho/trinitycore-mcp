  class: SpellClickInfo
  method: IsFitToRequirements
  signature: bool SpellClickInfo::IsFitToRequirements(const Unit * clicker, const
    Unit * clickee) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell click requirement is satisfied between two units.
  description: The IsFitToRequirements method evaluates if the conditions specified
    in a SpellClickInfo structure are met for a given pair of units. This typically
    checks if a player can interact with an NPC using a spell click event, considering
    factors such as faction, creature type, and other contextual requirements. The
    method is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to validate spell click
    interactions before allowing them to proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: clicker
    description: The Unit initiating the spell click interaction (typically a player).
  - name: clickee
    description: The Unit being clicked (typically an NPC) that may respond to the
      spell click.
  returns: Returns true if the spell click requirements are satisfied for both units;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Click Validation
    code: "if (spellClickInfo.IsFitToRequirements(playerUnit, npcUnit)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with spell click logic\n    playerUnit->CastSpell(npcUnit, SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Requirements Before Interaction
    code: "if (spellClickInfo.IsFitToRequirements(player, targetNpc)) {\n    // Validate\
      \ that the player and NPC meet all criteria\n    if (player->IsInMap(targetNpc)\
      \ && player->IsWithinDist(targetNpc, 5.0f)) {\n        // Perform spell click\
      \ action\n        targetNpc->CastSpell(player, SPELL_ID, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell click system in TrinityCore and is typically
    invoked during spell click events. It does not perform any direct spell casting
    but validates whether the interaction should be allowed based on defined requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that both units are valid pointers before calling this method,
    as passing null values may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
