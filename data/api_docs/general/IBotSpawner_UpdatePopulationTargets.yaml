  brief: Updates the population targets for bot spawning in the game world
  description: The UpdatePopulationTargets method recalculates and sets the desired
    population levels for different bot types within the game world. This method is
    typically invoked during server initialization or when adjusting bot behavior
    dynamically. It ensures that the number of active bots matches the configured
    target populations for various categories such as players, NPCs, or specific bot
    types. The method may interact with internal data structures that track current
    bot counts and desired ratios to maintain balanced gameplay environments.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: botSpawner->UpdatePopulationTargets();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any changes to bot configuration settings
    or when the server needs to rebalance bot populations. It may trigger internal
    recalculations that affect performance, especially in large-scale environments
    with many bot types.
