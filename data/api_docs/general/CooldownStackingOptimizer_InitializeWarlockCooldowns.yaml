  method: InitializeWarlockCooldowns
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializeWarlockCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for warlock class abilities.
  description: The InitializeWarlockCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and state management for tracking cooldowns specific to warlock spells and abilities.
    This includes initializing cooldown timers, setting up ability mappings, and preparing
    the optimizer to manage stacking behavior for warlock-specific effects such as
    Soulstone, Shadowfury, and other class mechanics. The method ensures that all
    warlock cooldowns are properly registered with the cooldown stacking system before
    any gameplay occurs.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeWarlockCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the initialization phase of a warlock's
    character setup or when a new cooldown tracking session begins. It prepares the
    internal state but does not actually start any timers or begin tracking cooldowns
    until subsequent calls to UpdateCooldowns or similar methods.
