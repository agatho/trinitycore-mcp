  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool AuraEventBus::ValidateEvent(const AuraEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether an aura event is properly initialized and conforms to expected
    constraints.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given AuraEvent object has been
    correctly initialized and meets all necessary conditions for processing within
    the TrinityCore framework. This includes verifying that required fields are set,
    data types are correct, and internal state is consistent. The method ensures that
    events are safe to process without causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior
    in the aura system. It serves as a sanity check before event handling logic executes,
    helping maintain system stability and preventing invalid operations on aura-related
    data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AuraEvent is valid and can be safely processed; returns
    false if the event contains invalid or incomplete data that would cause issues
    during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "AuraEvent event;\n// ... initialize event fields ...\nif (auraEventBus.ValidateEvent(event))\
      \ {\n    // Event is valid, proceed with processing\n    auraEventBus.ProcessEvent(event);\n\
      } else {\n    // Invalid event, log error or discard\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid aura event detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AuraEventBus before dispatching
    events to handlers. It's important for developers to understand that validation
    failures should not be ignored as they may indicate deeper issues in the aura
    system or incorrect event creation logic.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or partially constructed AuraEvent
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all required fields are properly
    set before calling ValidateEvent.
