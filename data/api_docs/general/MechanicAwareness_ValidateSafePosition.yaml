  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: ValidateSafePosition
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::ValidateSafePosition(const int & pos, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given position is safe for the bot to move to, considering
    mechanical awareness constraints.
  description: The ValidateSafePosition method checks if a specified position is considered
    safe for a bot player to navigate to. It evaluates various mechanical factors
    such as terrain, obstacles, and game-defined safety zones to determine if movement
    to that location would be acceptable. This method is typically used in AI pathfinding
    and decision-making logic to prevent bots from moving into dangerous or invalid
    positions. The validation considers the bot's current state, environment constraints,
    and any applied mechanics that might affect safe navigation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position index or identifier
      to validate. This value typically corresponds to a specific location in the
      game world's coordinate system or navigation mesh.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to validate
      the position. The method uses this player's state, mechanics, and current context
      to perform the validation check.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is deemed safe for the bot to move
    to, considering all relevant mechanical constraints and game rules; otherwise
    returns false if the position is unsafe or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "int targetPos = 12345;\nPlayer* myBot = ...; // bot player instance\nbool\
      \ isValid = mechanicAwareness.ValidateSafePosition(targetPos, myBot);\nif (isValid)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with movement to target position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Decision Making
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool ChooseNextMove(Player* bot, int potentialPosition)\
      \ {\n        if (mechanicAwareness.ValidateSafePosition(potentialPosition, bot))\
      \ {\n            // Safe to move\n            return true;\n        } else {\n\
      \            // Find alternative position\n            return false;\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the game's navigation mesh, terrain
    data, and mechanical constraints. It may be called frequently during AI pathfinding
    operations, so performance is important. The method assumes that both parameters
    are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is not null before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The position value should represent a valid location
    within the game world's navigation system for meaningful results.
