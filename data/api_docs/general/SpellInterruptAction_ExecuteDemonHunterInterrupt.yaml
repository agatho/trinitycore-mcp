  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteDemonHunterInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDemonHunterInterrupt(BotAI
    * ai, ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the bot is a Demon Hunter and
    the spell can be interrupted.
  description: The ExecuteDemonHunterInterrupt method checks whether the provided
    BotAI instance represents a Demon Hunter character and attempts to interrupt the
    specified target unit's current spell cast. It evaluates if the spell being cast
    is interruptible and if the conditions for interruption are met, such as proximity
    and spell type. This method is typically used in AI logic to control when a Demon
    Hunter should use its interrupt ability during combat. The method returns an ActionResult
    indicating success or failure of the interruption attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance representing the Demon Hunter character
      performing the interrupt action.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is currently casting a spell and
      may be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast by the target unit, used to determine
      if it can be interrupted.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating whether the interrupt was successful
    or failed. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Demon Hunter Interrupt Usage
    code: "if (SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDemonHunterInterrupt(ai, target, spellId)\
      \ == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Handle successful interrupt\n    ai->GetBot()->AddText(\"\
      Interrupted enemy spell!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt with Condition Check
    code: "if (ai->GetBot()->GetClass() == CLASS_DEMON_HUNTER && target && target->IsCasting())\n\
      {\n    uint32 currentSpellId = target->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_CHANNELED_SPELL)->m_spellInfo->Id;\n\
      \    ActionResult result = SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDemonHunterInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, currentSpellId);\n    if (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n    {\n\
      \        ai->GetBot()->AddText(\"Successfully interrupted spell.\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the AI is operating in a combat context where spell interruption
    makes sense. It relies on the underlying TrinityCore spell system to determine
    if a spell can be interrupted, and it respects the Demon Hunter's specific abilities
    such as Disrupt or other interrupt mechanics. The method does not perform any
    direct spell casting but rather acts as a control flow mechanism.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and actively casting a spell before
    calling this method. Calling with an invalid or null target may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes in the AI system. Also, be aware that not all spells can be
    interrupted; only those marked as interruptible will be processed.
