  method: GetDuration
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the duration in seconds of the item template's temporary enchantment
    or aura effect.
  description: The GetDuration method retrieves the duration value associated with
    an item template's temporary enchantment or aura effect. This duration is typically
    used for items that have time-limited effects such as temporary stat boosts, enchantments,
    or consumable items. The returned value represents the number of seconds the effect
    will remain active before expiring. For items without a defined duration, this
    method may return zero or a default value depending on the item's template configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the duration in seconds of the item's temporary
    enchantment or aura effect. Returns 0 if no duration is specified or if the item
    has no time-limited effects.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Duration of an Item Template
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ duration = itemTemplate->GetDuration();\nif (duration > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"\
      This item has a duration of %u seconds.\\n\", duration);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      This item has no time-limited effect.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The duration value is typically set in the item's template data within the
    database, specifically in fields related to enchantments or spell effects. This
    method should only be called on valid ItemTemplate objects that have been properly
    loaded from the database.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned duration represents
    a meaningful effect. It simply returns the value stored in the item template.
    If an item has no time-limited effects, this may return zero, which could lead
    to unexpected behavior if not checked properly.
