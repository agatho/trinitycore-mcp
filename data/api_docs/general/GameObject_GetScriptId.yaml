  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the GameObject.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique script identifier that
    is assigned to a GameObject instance. This identifier corresponds to the script
    name defined in the game object's script table, which determines how the GameObject
    interacts with the server's scripting system. The method is typically used during
    runtime to identify or reference specific game object behaviors or events. It
    returns a uint32 value representing the script ID, which can be used for various
    purposes including but not limited to triggering specific scripts or identifying
    objects in database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the unique script identifier assigned to the
    GameObject instance. This uint32 value corresponds to the script ID defined in
    the game object's script table and can be used for various purposes such as identifying
    specific behaviors, triggering events, or referencing in database queries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 scriptId = gameObject->GetScriptId();\nif (scriptId == 12345)\n\
      {\n    // Perform specific action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance
    considerations are minimal since it simply retrieves a stored value. Implementation
    details include that the script ID is typically set during object initialization
    or through database queries.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the returned script ID corresponds
    to an actual script defined in the server's script table. It is possible for the
    method to return zero if no script has been assigned, which may lead to confusion
    in logic handling.
