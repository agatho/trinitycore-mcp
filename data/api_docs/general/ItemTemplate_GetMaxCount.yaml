  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetMaxCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum stack count allowed for this item type.
  description: The GetMaxCount method retrieves the maximum number of items that can
    be stacked in a single inventory slot for the given item template. This value
    is defined in the item's database entry and determines how many copies of the
    item can coexist in one stack. For items that are not stackable, this value is
    typically 1. The returned value represents the upper limit for stacking behavior
    in World of Warcraft's inventory system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum stack count allowed for this item
    type. Returns 1 for non-stackable items, or higher values for items that can be
    stacked (e.g., 20 for a typical potion, 999 for quest items).
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is stackable
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ maxCount = itemTemplate->GetMaxCount();\nif (maxCount > 1)\n{\n    // Item\
      \ can be stacked\n    printf(\"This item supports stacking up to %u items per\
      \ stack.\\n\", maxCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item is not stackable\n    printf(\"\
      This item cannot be stacked.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine maximum possible quantity in inventory
    code: "ItemTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32 maxStackCount\
      \ = template->GetMaxCount();\nuint32 totalItems = 1000;\nuint32 maxPossibleStacks\
      \ = totalItems / maxStackCount;\nuint32 remainingItems = totalItems % maxStackCount;\n\
      printf(\"With %u items, you can have %u full stacks of %u and %u remaining.\\\
      n\", \n       totalItems, maxPossibleStacks, maxStackCount, remainingItems);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses the item template's MaxCount field which is
    loaded from the database at server startup. The value is cached and does not change
    during runtime for a given item type. For items with MaxCount = 0, it typically
    means the item has special stacking behavior or is handled differently by the
    game engine.
  warnings: Be aware that some items may have MaxCount = 0 in the database but are
    still stackable through other mechanisms (like quest items). Always validate the
    returned value if your code depends on specific stacking behavior. Also note that
    this method does not account for temporary modifications to item properties during
    runtime.
