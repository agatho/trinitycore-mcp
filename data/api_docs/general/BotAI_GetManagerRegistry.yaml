  signature: const ManagerRegistry * BotAI::GetManagerRegistry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant pointer to the ManagerRegistry instance associated with
    this BotAI object.
  description: The GetManagerRegistry method provides access to the ManagerRegistry
    that contains various managers used by the BotAI system. This registry typically
    holds references to different subsystems such as behavior managers, action handlers,
    or state controllers that are essential for bot decision-making and execution.
    The returned pointer is constant, meaning the registry itself cannot be modified
    through this interface. This method serves as a central access point for retrieving
    all manager instances needed by the AI logic within the bot framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the ManagerRegistry object associated with this BotAI
    instance. Returns nullptr if no registry has been initialized or assigned to the
    BotAI object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...;\nconst ManagerRegistry* registry = botAI->GetManagerRegistry();\n\
      if (registry)\n{\n    // Use the registry to access managers\n    // Example:\
      \ auto behaviorManager = registry->GetBehaviorManager();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Specific Managers
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...;\nconst ManagerRegistry* registry = botAI->GetManagerRegistry();\n\
      if (registry)\n{\n    auto actionManager = registry->GetActionManager();\n \
      \   auto behaviorManager = registry->GetBehaviorManager();\n    // Perform operations\
      \ using the managers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ManagerRegistry pointer is valid only as long as the BotAI object
    remains alive. Accessing the registry after the BotAI has been destroyed leads
    to undefined behavior. The method is thread-safe if the underlying BotAI instance
    is properly synchronized, but direct access to managers from multiple threads
    should be handled carefully.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the ManagerRegistry through the returned pointer
    as it's marked const. If the BotAI object hasn't been fully initialized, this
    method may return nullptr, so always check for null before using the returned
    value.
