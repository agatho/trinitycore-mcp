documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask for selected azerite essences, resetting tracking
    of modified entries.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes tracking mask
    within the SelectedAzeriteEssences class. This operation is typically used to
    indicate that any previously tracked modifications to the set of selected azerite
    essences have been processed or committed. The method ensures that subsequent
    calls to change detection functions will not report previously modified entries
    as changed, effectively synchronizing the internal state with the current data.
    This is commonly invoked after saving changes to the player's azerite essence
    selections or when preparing to process a new set of updates.

    code: 'SelectedAzeriteEssences essences;

      // ... modify some essences ...

      essences.ClearChangesMask(); // Reset change tracking'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not alter the actual selected azerite essence data, only
    the internal tracking mechanism for changes. It's typically called after applying
    or acknowledging changes to prevent redundant processing.
