  class: MetricStatistics
  method: GetAverage
  signature: double MetricStatistics::GetAverage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average value of all recorded metrics in the statistics
    object.
  description: 'The GetAverage method computes the arithmetic mean of all metric values
    that have been added to the MetricStatistics object. This method is typically
    used for performance monitoring, logging, or statistical analysis within the TrinityCore
    framework. It aggregates all stored data points and divides their sum by the count
    of entries to determine the average. The method does not modify any internal state
    and can be called multiple times without affecting the recorded metrics. Precondition:
    At least one metric value must have been added using the AddValue() method; otherwise,
    the result may be undefined or zero depending on implementation details.'
  parameters: []
  returns: A double-precision floating-point number representing the calculated average
    of all stored metric values. If no values are present, the behavior is implementation-defined
    but typically returns zero or a special NaN value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'MetricStatistics stats;

      stats.AddValue(10.5);

      stats.AddValue(20.3);

      stats.AddValue(15.7);

      double avg = stats.GetAverage(); // Returns 15.5

      std::cout << "Average: " << avg << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Average in Game Server Metrics
    code: "void LogServerMetrics() {\n    MetricStatistics packetLatency;\n    //\
      \ ... add various latency measurements ...\n    double avgLatency = packetLatency.GetAverage();\n\
      \    if (avgLatency > 100.0) {\n        sLog->outError(\"High average packet\
      \ latency detected: %f ms\", avgLatency);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple arithmetic mean calculation and does not account
    for weighted averages or outliers. It assumes all values contribute equally to
    the final result. For large datasets, consider potential floating-point precision
    loss when summing many small values.
  warnings: Calling GetAverage() on an empty MetricStatistics object may lead to undefined
    behavior or return zero depending on implementation. Always ensure that at least
    one value has been added before calling this method for reliable results.
