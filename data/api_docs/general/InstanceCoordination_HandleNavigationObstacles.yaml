    int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Updates navigation obstacles for a group within an instance coordination
    context.
  description: The HandleNavigationObstacles method manages the state of navigation
    obstacles for a specified group in the instance coordination system. This method
    is typically invoked when dynamic environmental changes occur that affect player
    movement, such as doors opening or closing, platforms shifting, or other interactive
    elements in dungeon or raid instances. It ensures that the group's pathfinding
    algorithms are aware of current obstacle configurations to prevent players from
    walking through invalid areas or getting stuck. The method operates within the
    TrinityCore framework's instance management system and integrates with the group's
    movement and positioning logic.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which navigation obstacles are being
      handled. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group
      currently participating in an instance.
  - name: obstacles
    description: Integer value representing the current state or count of navigation
      obstacles. The exact meaning depends on implementation, but typically indicates
      how many obstacles are active or their configuration flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance update
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnDoorStateChanged(Group* group, int obstacleCount)\n\
      {\n    instanceCoordination.HandleNavigationObstacles(group, obstacleCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating obstacles based on event trigger
    code: "void InstanceCoordination::HandleDoorOpenEvent()\n{\n    Group* group =\
      \ GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        int newObstacleCount = GetActiveObstacles();\n\
      \        HandleNavigationObstacles(group, newObstacleCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and should only be
    called when group movement or pathfinding needs to be updated due to environmental
    changes. It does not directly modify obstacle data but rather communicates state
    changes to the underlying navigation system.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and that the obstacle count
    reflects actual current conditions. Passing incorrect obstacle values may lead
    to unexpected player behavior or movement issues within instances.
