  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 CooldownEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending cooldown events in the CooldownEventBus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the current count of cooldown
    events that are queued for processing within the CooldownEventBus. This method
    is typically used to monitor or debug the state of active cooldowns, particularly
    in scenarios where multiple abilities or spells may be on cooldown simultaneously.
    The returned value represents how many events are waiting to be executed or processed
    by the event bus. This count can be useful for performance monitoring, ensuring
    cooldowns are properly managed, and identifying potential issues with event handling
    or timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of pending cooldown events
    currently queued in the CooldownEventBus. Returns zero if there are no pending
    events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Pending Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = cooldownEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"There are %u pending cooldown events\\n\", pendingCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Cooldown Event Queue Size
    code: "void MonitorCooldownEvents()\n{\n    uint32 count = cooldownEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 100)\n    {\n        // Log warning or take action for excessive\
      \ pending events\n        sLog->outError(\"High number of pending cooldown events:\
      \ %u\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a read-only operation and should not modify any
    internal state. It's important to note that the returned value may change between
    calls if other parts of the system are adding or removing events from the CooldownEventBus.
    The implementation likely uses atomic operations or thread-safe mechanisms to
    ensure consistency in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: This method does not provide information about which specific events are
    pending, only their count. If you need detailed event information, additional
    methods or data structures may be required. Be cautious when using this in performance-critical
    code paths as frequent calls could impact performance if the internal tracking
    mechanism is complex.
