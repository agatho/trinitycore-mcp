  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveTargetedHome
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveTargetedHome()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action for the unit to return to its targeted home position.
  description: The MoveTargetedHome method instructs the MotionMaster to begin moving
    the unit back to its designated home position, typically used for creatures that
    have been aggroed or moved away from their spawn point. This method is commonly
    invoked during AI behavior when a creature needs to return to its original location
    after pursuing or engaging targets. The movement is handled through the motion
    system and respects pathfinding constraints. It does not immediately teleport
    the unit but rather starts a gradual movement sequence towards the target home
    position.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature AI
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Return to home position after combat\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveTargetedHome();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the unit's stored home position which is typically
    set during spawn or when the creature is initialized. The actual movement behavior
    depends on the motion type and pathfinding system in use. It is recommended to
    call this method only when necessary to avoid unnecessary movement overhead.
  warnings: Calling MoveTargetedHome without a valid home position may result in undefined
    behavior or failed movement attempts. Ensure that the unit's home position has
    been properly initialized before invoking this method.
