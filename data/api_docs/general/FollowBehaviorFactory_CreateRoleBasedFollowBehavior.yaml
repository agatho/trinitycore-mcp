  method: CreateRoleBasedFollowBehavior
  signature: int FollowBehaviorFactory::CreateRoleBasedFollowBehavior(int role)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a follow behavior based on the specified role for AI-controlled
    NPCs in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CreateRoleBasedFollowBehavior method is responsible for generating
    appropriate follow behaviors for NPC units within the TrinityCore framework. It
    takes an integer role parameter that determines how the NPC should behave when
    following a target, such as a player or another unit. This method integrates with
    the AI system to assign specific movement and action patterns based on predefined
    roles like 'tank', 'healer', or 'damage dealer'. The returned integer value typically
    represents a unique identifier or handle for the created behavior, which can be
    used later to manage or modify the behavior. This functionality is essential for
    creating organized group dynamics in instances, raids, and player encounters where
    NPCs need to follow specific roles.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: An integer value representing the role type for the follow behavior.
      Valid values typically correspond to predefined roles such as 0 (default), 1
      (tank), 2 (healer), or 3 (damage dealer). The exact mapping depends on internal
      constants defined in the TrinityCore AI system.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the created follow behavior.
    A positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative value may indicate
    an error or invalid role parameter was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int behaviorId = factory->CreateRoleBasedFollowBehavior(1); // Creates\
      \ tank role behavior\nif (behaviorId >= 0)\n{\n    // Behavior successfully\
      \ created and can be used\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "int result = factory->CreateRoleBasedFollowBehavior(99);\nif (result <\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Handle invalid role case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create\
      \ follow behavior for invalid role: %d\", 99);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and relies on internal role
    mappings defined in the TrinityCore codebase. The returned behavior ID should
    be stored for later reference when managing or modifying the behavior. This function
    may involve memory allocation for behavior objects and should be called sparingly
    to avoid performance issues in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid role parameter may result in undefined
    behavior or error codes. Ensure that only valid role values are passed to prevent
    system instability. The returned behavior ID must be properly managed to avoid
    memory leaks or dangling references.
