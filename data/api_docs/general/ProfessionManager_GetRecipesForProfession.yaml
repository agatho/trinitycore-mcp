  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetRecipesForProfession
  signature: int ProfessionManager::GetRecipesForProfession(ProfessionType profession)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of recipes available for a specified profession.
  description: The GetRecipesForProfession method returns the count of recipes that
    are known or accessible to the player for the given profession. This method is
    typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation,
    where professions such as Engineering, Alchemy, or Blacksmithing have associated
    recipe data stored in the database. The returned integer represents how many distinct
    recipes the player has learned or can learn for that specific profession. It does
    not return the actual recipe data itself, but rather a count of available recipes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of recipes available for the specified
    profession. Returns 0 if no recipes are found or if the profession is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int recipeCount = professionManager.GetRecipesForProfession(PROFESSION_ENGINEERING);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Recipe Availability
    code: "if (professionManager.GetRecipesForProfession(PROFESSION_ALCHEMY) > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player has at least one alchemy recipe\n    printf(\"Player knows\
      \ %d alchemy recipes\\n\", professionManager.GetRecipesForProfession(PROFESSION_ALCHEMY));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely queries internal data structures or database tables that
    store player profession and recipe information. It may be used in UI rendering
    to display the number of available recipes or for conditional logic based on recipe
    availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the ProfessionType parameter is valid; passing an invalid
    profession type might result in unexpected behavior or a return value of zero.
    This method does not perform any permission checks, so it should only be called
    when appropriate access rights are confirmed.
