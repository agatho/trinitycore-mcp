  signature: bool HavocDemonHunterRefactored::IsGroupTakingHeavyDamage() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's group is currently taking heavy damage.
  description: This method evaluates the current health status of all group members
    within the player's party or raid to determine if they are experiencing significant
    damage. It typically checks for low health percentages or high damage taken over
    a recent time period. The method is used by the Havoc Demon Hunter AI to make
    tactical decisions, such as when to use defensive abilities or repositioning strategies.
    This check helps the AI prioritize healing or damage mitigation actions based
    on group survivability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is taking heavy damage (defined by internal thresholds),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->IsGroupTakingHeavyDamage()) {\n    // Use defensive\
      \ ability\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_DEMONSPAWN, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Damage Monitoring System
    code: "class HavocDemonHunterAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (IsGroupTakingHeavyDamage()) {\n            //\
      \ Prioritize healing over damage output\n            DoCast(SPELL_FEL_BARRAGE);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method uses internal group health tracking and may cache results for
    performance. It's designed to be called frequently during AI updates but should
    not be used in high-frequency loops without consideration of performance impact.
  warnings: This method relies on accurate group member health tracking, which may
    not always reflect real-time damage if the game state is not properly synchronized.
    Avoid calling this method in contexts where it might cause unnecessary computational
    overhead.
