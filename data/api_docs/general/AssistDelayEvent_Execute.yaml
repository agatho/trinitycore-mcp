  class: AssistDelayEvent
  method: Execute
  signature: bool AssistDelayEvent::Execute(uint64 e_time, uint32 p_time)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the assist delay event logic to determine if a creature can assist
    its target.
  description: The Execute method is responsible for handling the timing and conditions
    of when a creature may provide assistance to its target during combat. This method
    typically checks whether the required delay period has passed since the last assist
    action, ensuring that creatures do not spam assist behavior too frequently. It
    evaluates internal state variables related to the event's execution time and processing
    time to decide whether the assist action should proceed or be deferred. The method
    is commonly used in AI systems for managing NPC behavior during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the assist delay has elapsed and the creature can perform
    the assist action; returns false otherwise, indicating that the assist is still
    on cooldown or the conditions are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "if (assistEvent->Execute(getMSTime(), 0)) {\n    // Perform assist logic\
      \ here\n    creature->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's event handling system and relies
    on accurate timing mechanisms. It should be called regularly within the creature's
    AI update loop to ensure proper behavior.
