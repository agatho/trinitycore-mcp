  class: BotProfiler
  method: ConfigureSession
  signature: void BotProfiler::ConfigureSession(uint64_t sessionId, ProfilingScope
    scope, uint32_t samplingIntervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Configures a profiling session with specified scope and sampling interval
    for bot performance monitoring.
  description: The ConfigureSession method initializes or modifies a profiling session
    identified by a unique session ID. It sets up the profiling scope which determines
    what aspects of bot behavior are monitored, and defines how frequently samples
    are collected during the profiling period. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with bot management systems to gather performance data for analysis and optimization
    purposes. The session configuration affects how subsequent profiling data is recorded
    and processed within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the profiling session. This value must be
      a valid 64-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies the session across
      the system.
  - name: scope
    description: Defines the profiling scope which determines what aspects of bot
      behavior are monitored. Valid values are typically enum constants representing
      different profiling categories like AI behavior, movement patterns, or resource
      usage.
  - name: samplingIntervalMs
    description: Specifies the interval in milliseconds between each sampling point
      during profiling. Must be a positive integer value; smaller intervals provide
      more granular data but increase overhead.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Configuration
    code: 'uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;

      ProfilingScope scope = ProfilingScope::AI_BEHAVIOR;

      uint32_t interval = 100;

      botProfiler.ConfigureSession(sessionId, scope, interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Session Setup with Multiple Parameters
    code: 'uint64_t sessionId = GetNextSessionId();

      ProfilingScope scope = static_cast<ProfilingScope>(0x01 | 0x02); // Combine
      multiple scopes

      uint32_t interval = 50;

      botProfiler.ConfigureSession(sessionId, scope, interval);

      // Subsequent profiling will capture both AI and movement data at 50ms intervals'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot profiling infrastructure in TrinityCore. The
    session ID should be unique to avoid conflicts with other active profiling sessions.
    The sampling interval directly impacts performance overhead, so values should
    be chosen carefully based on monitoring requirements and system resources.
  warnings: Modifying an existing session configuration while profiling is in progress
    may lead to inconsistent data collection. Ensure that all profiling sessions are
    properly terminated before reconfiguring them. Using very small sampling intervals
    (less than 10ms) can cause significant performance degradation.
