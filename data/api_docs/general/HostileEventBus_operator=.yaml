    param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one HostileEventBus object to another
  description: The assignment operator for HostileEventBus performs a deep copy of
    all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This method
    is typically used when duplicating event bus instances or reassigning existing
    buses to new states. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and event handling system,
    this operation ensures that all registered hostile events, callbacks, and state
    information are properly transferred between instances. The assignment maintains
    the integrity of event subscriptions and prevents dangling references by properly
    managing internal resource allocation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source HostileEventBus object to copy from. This parameter must
      be a valid, initialized instance of HostileEventBus.
  returns: A reference to the current HostileEventBus object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'HostileEventBus bus1;

      HostileEventBus bus2 = bus1; // Uses copy constructor

      // or

      bus2 = bus1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'HostileEventBus bus1, bus2, bus3;

      bus3 = bus2 = bus1; // Chained assignment

      // All three buses now contain identical data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    event handlers and state information are properly duplicated. The implementation
    should handle potential memory management concerns for dynamically allocated resources
    within the event bus.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large HostileEventBus objects as it may involve
    significant memory allocation and copying operations. Ensure that both source
    and target objects are in a valid state before assignment to avoid undefined behavior.
