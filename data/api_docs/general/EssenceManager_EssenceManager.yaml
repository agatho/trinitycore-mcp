  class: EssenceManager
  method: EssenceManager
  signature: void EssenceManager::EssenceManager(EvokerAI * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the EssenceManager with the provided EvokerAI owner instance.
  description: The EssenceManager constructor initializes the manager with a reference
    to an EvokerAI object, which serves as the owner of this essence management system.
    This setup allows the manager to interact with and control the evoker's essence-related
    abilities and states. The method establishes necessary internal references and
    configurations required for essence tracking, cooldowns, and ability usage within
    the context of the evoker's AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = new EvokerAI();

      EssenceManager manager(evoker);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method and should only be called during object initialization.
    The owner parameter must not be null, as it's used extensively throughout the
    essence management logic.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the owner parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the EvokerAI instance is properly initialized
    before passing it to this constructor.
