  class: BeastMasteryPetManager
  method: CommandPetAttack
  signature: void BeastMasteryPetManager::CommandPetAttack(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Orders the beast mastery pet to attack a specified target.
  description: The CommandPetAttack method instructs a beast mastery pet to initiate
    an attack against a given target. This method is typically used in the context
    of hunter pet management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The
    function likely sends a command packet to the client to update the pet's behavior
    and target selection. It operates on a pointer to an integer representing the
    target's identifier, which could be a GUID or similar reference. The method does
    not return any value but modifies the pet's current state and action queue.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer that represents the target identifier for
      the pet to attack. This is typically a GUID or unique object identifier used
      by the TrinityCore server to reference units in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Attack Command
    code: 'BeastMasteryPetManager petManager;

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      petManager.CommandPetAttack(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the beast mastery hunter pet system and should only
    be called when a valid pet exists and has been assigned to the hunter. The target
    must be a valid unit in the game world, otherwise the behavior may be undefined
    or result in no action being taken.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, verify that the target
    unit is within the pet's attack range and visibility to prevent invalid command
    execution.
