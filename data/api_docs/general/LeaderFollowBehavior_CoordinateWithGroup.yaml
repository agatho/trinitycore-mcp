  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::CoordinateWithGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates the behavior of a leader with their group members for follow
    mechanics.
  description: The CoordinateWithGroup method manages the interaction between a leader
    and their group members in the context of following behavior. It ensures that
    group members properly respond to the leader's movements and maintain appropriate
    positioning within the group. This method is typically invoked during group movement
    scenarios where synchronization of player actions is required. The implementation
    likely handles pathfinding, positioning updates, and state management for all
    group members relative to the leader.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group movement
    code: "void HandleGroupMovement(Player* leader)\n{\n    Group* group = leader->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;\n        behavior.CoordinateWithGroup(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables related to group positioning
    and movement synchronization. It may trigger AI updates for all group members
    to ensure they follow the leader correctly.
