documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the game teleport locations database table into memory
    for fast lookup.
  description: The LoadGameTele method is responsible for loading all teleport location
    entries from the 'game_tele' database table into an internal in-memory data structure.
    This allows the server to quickly retrieve teleport coordinates and names without
    repeatedly querying the database. The method is typically called during server
    startup or when the game teleports database is modified and needs to be reloaded.
    It processes each entry in the table, validates the data, and stores it in a map
    for efficient retrieval by name or ID. This ensures that players can use commands
    like .tele or .goto to instantly teleport to predefined locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGameTele();\n    // Continue with other initialization\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during server startup and again when
    the 'game_tele' table is updated while the server is running. The loaded data
    is stored in a std::map for O(log n) lookup performance. The method does not return
    any error codes, but it will silently skip invalid entries in the database.
  warnings: Modifying the 'game_tele' table while the server is running without reloading
    can cause inconsistencies. The method assumes all database entries are valid and
    properly formatted. If the database connection fails or the table doesn't exist,
    the method may produce unexpected behavior or crash.
