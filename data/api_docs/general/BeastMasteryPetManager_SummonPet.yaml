  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for creating and summoning a beast
    companion pet for a player who has the Beast Mastery talent specialization. This
    method typically handles the logic for pet creation, including setting up the
    pet's properties, linking it to the player, and displaying the pet in the game
    world. The summoned pet will follow the player's commands and can be controlled
    through the UI or via game mechanics associated with Beast Mastery abilities.

    the player to have a valid Beast Mastery talent tree. The actual pet summoned
    depends on the player's selected pet type and level.
