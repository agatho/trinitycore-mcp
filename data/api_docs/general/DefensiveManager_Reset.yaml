  class: DefensiveManager
  method: Reset
  signature: void DefensiveManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the defensive manager's state to its initial conditions.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the DefensiveManager's
    internal state, typically clearing any active defensive abilities, cooldowns,
    or tracking data. This method is commonly invoked when a creature or player enters
    a new phase of combat, transitions between different battle states, or when the
    system requires a clean slate for defensive behavior. It ensures that all defensive
    mechanisms are properly reset before resuming normal operation.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'DefensiveManager* defManager = new DefensiveManager();

      // ... perform some defensive actions ...

      defManager->Reset(); // Reset all defensive states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during state transitions to avoid
    unintended side effects. The exact internal behavior may vary depending on the
    subclass or implementation of DefensiveManager.
