  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordMemoryUsage
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordMemoryUsage(uint32 botCount, uint64
    totalMemoryBytes)
documentation:
  brief: Records memory usage statistics for a specified number of bots.
  description: 'The RecordMemoryUsage method is used to log or store memory consumption
    data associated with a given number of AI-controlled bots in the TrinityCore framework.
    This method allows performance monitoring systems to track how much memory is
    being utilized by bot instances, which is crucial for maintaining server stability
    and identifying potential memory leaks or performance bottlenecks. The method
    accepts two parameters: the count of active bots and the total memory consumed
    in bytes. It is typically invoked during periodic performance checks or when bot
    states change significantly.'
  parameters:
  - name: botCount
    description: The number of AI-controlled bots whose memory usage is being recorded.
      This value must be a non-negative integer representing the current active bot
      count.
  - name: totalMemoryBytes
    description: The total amount of memory consumed by all active bots, measured
      in bytes. This value should reflect the cumulative memory footprint of bot-related
      data structures and resources.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = sObjectMgr->GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      uint32 activeBots = 10;

      uint64 memoryUsed = 512000; // 512 KB

      monitor->RecordMemoryUsage(activeBots, memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "void UpdateBotPerformance()\n{\n    IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = sObjectMgr->GetBotPerformanceMonitor();\n\
      \    uint32 botCount = sObjectMgr->GetActiveBotCount();\n    uint64 totalMemory\
      \ = 0;\n    \n    // Calculate total memory used by bots\n    for (auto& bot\
      \ : sObjectMgr->GetAllBots())\n    {\n        totalMemory += bot->GetMemoryFootprint();\n\
      \    }\n    \n    monitor->RecordMemoryUsage(botCount, totalMemory);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a performance monitoring interface and may be called
    from multiple threads. Ensure thread safety if custom implementations are used.
    The recorded data can be used for profiling, debugging, or generating reports
    on bot resource consumption.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing negative values for botCount or excessively large
    values for totalMemoryBytes could lead to unexpected behavior or overflow issues
    in performance tracking systems.
