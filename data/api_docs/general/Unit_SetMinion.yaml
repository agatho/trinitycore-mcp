  class: Unit
  method: SetMinion
  signature: void Unit::SetMinion(Minion * minion, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a minion to be controlled by this unit.
  description: The SetMinion method allows a Unit (such as a player or creature) to
    control a Minion, typically a summoned creature. This method manages the relationship
    between the controlling unit and the minion, establishing or removing the control
    based on the apply parameter. When applied, the minion becomes bound to the unit's
    control, allowing for direct command of the minion's actions. This is commonly
    used in player-controlled summons or AI-controlled creatures where the unit needs
    to manage its summoned minions.
  parameters:
  - name: minion
    description: Pointer to the Minion object that will be controlled by this unit.
      Must be a valid pointer to a Minion instance.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove control of the
      minion. True applies control, false removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetAI();

      Minion* minion = new Minion();

      unit->SetMinion(minion, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = creature->GetAI();

      Minion* minion = creature->GetMinion();

      unit->SetMinion(minion, false);

      // This removes control from the minion'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that manage
    summoning or control of creatures. It requires careful handling to ensure proper
    memory management and avoid dangling pointers. The apply parameter determines
    whether the minion is actively controlled or not.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory leaks or crashes if the
    minion pointer is invalid or if the minion is deleted without properly removing
    control. Care must be taken when applying control to ensure that the minion remains
    valid throughout its control period.
