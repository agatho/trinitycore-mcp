  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void WarriorAI::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the warrior's buff states and applies appropriate combat abilities
    based on current game conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating the
    warrior AI's active buffs and debuffs during combat. It evaluates the current
    state of the warrior, including health, mana, and enemy proximity, to determine
    which buffs should be applied or maintained. This method typically handles the
    logic for activating abilities like Battle Shout, Berserker Rage, or other class-specific
    enhancements that improve combat effectiveness. The function is called regularly
    during the AI update cycle and ensures that the warrior maintains optimal buff
    states throughout encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be called manually unless implementing custom behavior. The implementation
    may vary between different warrior specializations (Arms, Fury, Protection) and
    could involve complex state management for multiple buffs simultaneously.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI update loop without
    understanding its internal dependencies. Improper usage might lead to inconsistent
    buff states or unexpected combat behavior.
