  class: BotProfiler
  method: CollectSample
  signature: void BotProfiler::CollectSample()
documentation:
  brief: Collects a profiling sample from the bot system for performance analysis.
  description: The CollectSample method gathers performance data from the bot system,
    including CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time metrics. This method
    is typically invoked during profiling sessions to capture real-time statistics
    about bot behavior and resource utilization. The collected samples are used to
    identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and monitor the efficiency of AI-driven
    bots within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not require any specific
    preconditions but should be called periodically during active bot operations for
    meaningful data collection.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Sample Collection
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.CollectSample();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Sampling for Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorBots()\n{\n    BotProfiler profiler;\n    for (int i = 0; i\
      \ < 100; ++i)\n    {\n        profiler.CollectSample();\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking. It should not
    significantly impact bot performance during execution. The collected data is typically
    stored in internal buffers for later analysis or reporting.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper sampling intervals may
    lead to excessive overhead. Ensure that profiling samples are collected at appropriate
    intervals to maintain system stability.
