  signature: size_t Map::DespawnAll(SpawnObjectType type, int spawnId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all game objects and creatures entries of a specified type from the
    map.
  description: The DespawnAll method removes all game objects and creature entries
    of a specified type from the map, effectively clearing the map of all entities
    that match the given spawn type. This method is commonly used during map loading
    or cleanup operations to ensure that no stale entries remain in memory. The method
    operates on a per-type basis, allowing for precise control over which entity types
    are removed from the map. It returns the count of entities successfully removed,
    making it useful for tracking and debugging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The spawn type to remove from the map. Valid values include SpawnObjectType::Creature,
      SpawnObjectType::GameObject, and potentially others depending on the implementation.
  - name: spawnId
    description: The specific spawn ID to target for removal. This parameter allows
      for selective removal of entities matching a particular spawn ID within the
      specified type.
  returns: Returns the number of entities successfully removed from the map. A value
    of zero indicates no entities matched the specified criteria, while positive values
    indicate successful removal of entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      size_t removedCount = map->DespawnAll(SpawnObjectType::Creature, 12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      size_t removedCount = map->DespawnAll(SpawnObjectType::GameObject, -1);

      // This removes all game objects regardless of spawn ID

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during map loading or cleanup operations
    as it can affect performance if large numbers of entities are removed. The method
    is thread-safe and operates on the map's internal data structures, making it suitable
    for use in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may lead to removal of unintended entities
    if spawnId is not properly specified. Additionally, removing all entities from
    a map can cause performance issues if the map contains many entities, particularly
    in high-traffic zones.
