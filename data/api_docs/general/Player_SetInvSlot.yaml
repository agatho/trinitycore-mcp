documentation:
  brief: Sets the inventory slot for a player's item
  description: The SetInvSlot method assigns an item to a specific inventory slot
    for a player, allowing control over item placement within the player's inventory.
    This method is typically used during item creation or modification processes where
    items need to be positioned in specific slots. The operation affects the player's
    inventory structure and can influence gameplay mechanics such as item equip/unequip
    behavior. It requires proper handling of GUIDs and slot validation to ensure correct
    functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index where the item should be placed. Valid values
      range from 0 to 36, representing different inventory slots including backpack,
      equipped items, and other specific positions.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item being assigned to the slot.
      This GUID represents the item's identity within the game world and must be valid
      for proper assignment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int guid = 12345;

      uint32 slot = 0;

      player->SetInvSlot(slot, guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int guid = 12345;

      uint32 slot = 10;

      player->SetInvSlot(slot, guid);

      // This sets a specific item in slot 10, which might be an equipped item'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of inventory slot validation and
    GUID assignment. Performance considerations arise from frequent slot updates during
    item creation or modification processes. Thread safety is important when multiple
    threads access player inventory simultaneously.
  warnings: Care must be taken to validate slot indices and GUID values before assignment.
    Incorrect slot assignments can lead to game mechanics issues or item loss. Common
    mistakes include using invalid slot numbers or assigning incorrect GUIDs.
