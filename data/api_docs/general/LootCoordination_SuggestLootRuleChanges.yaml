  class: LootCoordination
  method: SuggestLootRuleChanges
  signature: void LootCoordination::SuggestLootRuleChanges(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Suggests loot rule changes for a group based on current loot coordination
    settings.
  description: The SuggestLootRuleChanges method evaluates the current loot distribution
    rules and group composition to propose modifications that could improve fairness
    or efficiency in loot allocation. This method is typically invoked when a group's
    loot settings need adjustment, such as when transitioning from free-for-all to
    need-before-greed systems or when optimizing for specific loot types. It analyzes
    group member roles, loot priorities, and current rule configurations to determine
    if changes would benefit the group's overall loot experience.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Suggest loot rule changes for a group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);

      LootCoordination::SuggestLootRuleChanges(myGroup);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot coordination data structures
    and may modify group settings in-place. It's designed to be called during group
    updates or when significant changes occur in group composition or loot distribution
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it could lead to undefined behavior if used on an invalid group
    reference.
