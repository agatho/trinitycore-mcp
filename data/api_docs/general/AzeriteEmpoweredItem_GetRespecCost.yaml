  signature: int AzeriteEmpoweredItem::GetRespecCost() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cost in copper coins required to reset Azerite
    trait selections on an item.
  description: The GetRespecCost method determines the monetary cost associated with
    resetting all Azerite traits selected on a given Azerite empowered item. This
    cost is typically used when players wish to reassign their Azerite powers after
    making incorrect choices or wanting to experiment with different builds. The returned
    value represents the total copper amount needed for this respec operation, which
    may vary based on factors such as the item's level, the number of unlocked Azerite
    traits, and any applicable server-side modifiers or discounts. This method does
    not perform the actual reset; it only provides the cost information.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total cost in copper coins required to respec
    the Azerite traits on the item. Returns zero if no respec is needed or if the
    item has no Azerite traits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n\
      {\n    int cost = item->GetRespecCost();\n    if (cost > 0)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Display cost to player\n        player->SendNotification(\"Respec cost:\
      \ %d copper\", cost);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before initiating an Azerite respec transaction.
    The actual implementation may consider item quality, level, and server configuration
    settings for determining the final cost.
  warnings: Ensure that the AzeriteEmpoweredItem pointer is valid before calling this
    method to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. The returned value
    should be validated against player's available funds before proceeding with any
    monetary transaction.
