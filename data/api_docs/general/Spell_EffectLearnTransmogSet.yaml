  brief: Learn transmog set from spell effect
  description: This method processes a spell effect that allows players to learn transmogrification
    sets. It typically occurs when a player uses a transmogrification item or spell
    that grants access to specific transmog sets. The method handles the logic of
    adding the transmog set to the player's collection, enabling them to apply those
    items for transmogrification purposes. This function is part of the broader spell
    handling system and may involve checking prerequisites such as player level requirements
    or specific item conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectLearnTransmogSet();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking if the player has already learned
    the transmog set, ensuring proper item requirements are met, and possibly updating
    the player's transmog collection. Performance considerations involve minimal overhead
    since this is typically a simple operation.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the spell effect is properly initialized
    and valid. Improper use may lead to incorrect transmog set learning or failure
    to update player's collection.
