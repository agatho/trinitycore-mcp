  signature: void MechanicAwareness::HandleGroundEffect(const int & center, float
    radius, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes ground effect mechanics for a bot player within a specified radius.
  description: The HandleGroundEffect method is responsible for managing and applying
    ground-based effects or mechanics to a bot player within a defined circular area.
    This method likely interacts with the game's environmental triggers, terrain effects,
    or spell mechanics that are tied to specific ground locations. It evaluates the
    center point and radius to determine which ground effects should be activated
    or modified for the given player. The implementation may involve checking for
    active spells, environmental hazards, or other world objects that influence player
    behavior when within the specified area.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the ground effect area, represented as an integer
      coordinate value. This typically corresponds to a position in the game world
      where the effect originates.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area affected by the ground effect, specified
      as a floating-point value. Determines how far the effect extends from the center
      point.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be affected
      by the ground effect. This parameter identifies which player instance the mechanics
      should be applied to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int center = 12345;

      float radius = 10.0f;

      Player* bot = playerBot;

      mechanicAwareness->HandleGroundEffect(center, radius, bot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Center
    code: 'Position pos;

      playerBot->GetPosition(&pos);

      int center = static_cast<int>(pos.GetPositionX() * 100 + pos.GetPositionY()
      * 100);

      float radius = playerBot->GetMap()->GetHeight(pos.GetPositionX(), pos.GetPositionY())
      > 0 ? 5.0f : 15.0f;

      mechanicAwareness->HandleGroundEffect(center, radius, playerBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an AI system that handles environmental awareness
    for bot players. The integer center value may represent a packed coordinate or
    hash of position data. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls
    to this method during high-frequency updates, as it might involve multiple checks
    against world objects or spell effects.
  warnings: Ensure the center parameter is valid and within expected bounds to prevent
    undefined behavior. The bot pointer must not be null when passed to this method,
    otherwise it will result in a crash or access violation.
