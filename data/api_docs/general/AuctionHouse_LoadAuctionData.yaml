  method: LoadAuctionData
  signature: void AuctionHouse::LoadAuctionData()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all auction house data from the database into memory for active auctions
    and auction items.
  description: The LoadAuctionData method initializes the auction house system by
    retrieving all active auction records from the database and populating internal
    data structures. This includes loading auction items, their bids, time limits,
    and associated metadata required for the auction house functionality. The method
    is typically called during server startup or when the auction house system needs
    to be refreshed with current data. It ensures that all auctions are properly loaded
    and ready for player interaction, including handling of expired auctions and bid
    processing. This method does not directly interact with players but prepares the
    underlying data structures necessary for auction operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAuctionHouse()\n{\n    AuctionHouse* auctionHouse = sAuctionHouseMgr;\n\
      \    auctionHouse->LoadAuctionData();\n    // Auction data is now loaded and\
      \ ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries and should only be called during server
    initialization or when a complete refresh of auction data is required. It may
    cause temporary performance degradation due to database loading operations. The
    method assumes that the database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly during runtime can lead to memory leaks
    or duplicate auction entries. It should only be invoked once during server startup
    or when explicitly needed to refresh auction data. Improper use may result in
    inconsistent auction states or corrupted auction house data.
