  method: CanAlwaysSee
  signature: bool WorldObject::CanAlwaysSee(const WorldObject * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object can always see another object regardless of
    distance or obstruction.
  description: The CanAlwaysSee method checks if a WorldObject can always see another
    WorldObject, meaning it has no restrictions on visibility due to distance, line
    of sight, or other factors. This method is typically used in game mechanics where
    visibility needs to be evaluated without normal constraints. It's commonly employed
    for checking whether an object (like a player or NPC) can see another object even
    when they are far apart or separated by terrain or obstacles. The method is particularly
    useful in scenarios involving world events, quest triggers, or when evaluating
    visibility for certain spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object can always see the target object, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether visibility is unrestricted between the two objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanAlwaysSee(targetNPC))\n{\n    // Player can see NPC without\
      \ restrictions\n    // Do something with NPC\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other visibility-related methods
    to determine if an object has unrestricted visibility. Performance considerations
    may arise when checking many objects simultaneously, especially in large groups
    or during combat situations.
  warnings: This method does not account for normal visibility restrictions such as
    line of sight or distance; it assumes all visibility constraints are bypassed.
    Care should be taken when using this method in contexts where normal visibility
    rules apply, as it may lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly.
