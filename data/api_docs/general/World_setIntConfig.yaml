  class: World
  method: setIntConfig
  signature: void World::setIntConfig(WorldIntConfigs index, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets an integer configuration value for the world based on the provided index.
  description: The setIntConfig method is used to update a specific integer configuration
    setting within the World object. This method accepts a WorldIntConfigs enumeration
    index and a uint32 value to assign to that configuration. It is typically used
    during server initialization or runtime to modify various game settings such as
    maximum player count, PvP ranking thresholds, or other numeric game parameters.
    The method performs no validation on the input value, so it's important to ensure
    that the provided value is appropriate for the given configuration index. This
    method directly modifies internal world state and may affect gameplay mechanics
    depending on which configuration is being changed.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: A WorldIntConfigs enumeration value specifying which integer configuration
      to modify. This determines the type of setting being updated (e.g., maximum
      players, PvP thresholds, etc.).
  - name: value
    description: The uint32 value to assign to the specified configuration index.
      Must be a valid positive integer appropriate for the target configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Player Count
    code: World::instance()->setIntConfig(WORLD_MAX_PLAYERS, 1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating PvP Ranking Threshold
    code: World::instance()->setIntConfig(WORLD_PVP_RANKING_THRESHOLD, 5000);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies global server state and should be used carefully. Changes
    made through this method may not persist across server restarts unless explicitly
    saved to configuration files. The method is likely thread-safe in the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, but direct manipulation of world configurations
    during active gameplay sessions might cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect values for the configuration index could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the value being set is appropriate for the target configuration.
    Modifying critical game settings at runtime without proper validation may affect
    server stability or player experience.
