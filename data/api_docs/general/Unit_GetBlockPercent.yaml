documentation:
  brief: Returns the block chance percentage for the specified weapon type.
  description: This method retrieves the block chance percentage for a given weapon
    type, which is used in combat calculations to determine the likelihood of successfully
    blocking an attack. The method is typically used to check the block chance of
    off-hand weapons or to calculate block chance for specific weapon types. It can
    be used in conjunction with other combat-related methods to determine overall
    block effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the block chance percentage for the
    specified weapon type, ranging from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no chance
    of blocking and 100.0 indicates maximum chance of blocking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float blockChance = unit->GetBlockPercent(0);

      // Returns the block chance for main hand weapons'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is typically used in combat calculations.
    It should be noted that the parameter value represents weapon type, which can
    be 0 (main hand), 1 (off-hand), or 2 ( ranged). The method may return different
    values based on player's equipment and skill level.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in combat calculations without
    considering other factors such as player's weapon skill and block chance modifiers.
    Also, the returned value might be affected by various buffs and debuffs that can
    influence block chance.
