  class: Minion
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Minion::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information string for the minion including its type, GUID,
    and current state.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method generates a formatted string containing diagnostic
    information about the minion instance. This includes the minion's type identifier,
    its unique game object GUID, and its current operational state such as whether
    it is active, summoned, or despawned. The returned debug string is primarily intended
    for logging, debugging, and development purposes to help developers track minion
    behavior during runtime. The method does not modify any internal state of the
    minion and is safe to call at any time during the minion's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the minion including
    its type, GUID, and current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Minion* myMinion = ...; // Assume minion is initialized

      std::string debugInfo = myMinion->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("entities.minion", "Minion debug info: {}", debugInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Debug Info in Game Log for Troubleshooting
    code: "void HandleMinionCommand(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Creature* minion =\
      \ player->GetMiniPet())\n    {\n        std::string debugInfo = minion->GetDebugInfo();\n\
      \        player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Minion Debug: %s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for debugging and development purposes. The
    returned string format may change between TrinityCore versions, so relying on
    exact string parsing should be avoided in production code. The method performs
    minimal computation and is thread-safe as it only reads existing member variables.
  warnings: The debug information string contains internal identifiers that may not
    be suitable for end-user display. Additionally, calling this method on a destroyed
    or invalid minion pointer will result in undefined behavior, so callers should
    ensure the minion object is valid before invoking this method.
