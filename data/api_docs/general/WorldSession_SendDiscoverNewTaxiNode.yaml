  class: WorldSession
  method: SendDiscoverNewTaxiNode
  signature: void WorldSession::SendDiscoverNewTaxiNode(uint32 nodeid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the client indicating that a new taxi node has been discovered.
  description: The SendDiscoverNewTaxiNode method is used to notify the player's client
    that a previously unknown taxi node has been discovered. This typically occurs
    when a player learns a new flight path or discovers a previously hidden taxi location.
    The method sends an update packet to the client which will visually mark the new
    node on the flight map and potentially update the player's known flight paths.
    This functionality is integral to the World of Warcraft taxi system, allowing
    players to unlock new travel options as they progress through the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: nodeid
    description: The unique identifier of the taxi node that has been discovered.
      This ID corresponds to a specific location in the game's flight path database
      and typically maps to a known taxi node in the DBC files.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Discovering a New Taxi Node
    code: "void Player::LearnTaxiPath(uint32 nodeId)\n{\n    // ... other logic to\
      \ learn the path ...\n    GetSession()->SendDiscoverNewTaxiNode(nodeId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatically Discovering Taxi Nodes on Quest Completion
    code: "void QuestHandler::OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n\
      \    // ... quest completion logic ...\n    if (questId == 12345) // Example\
      \ quest that unlocks a taxi node\n    {\n        player->GetSession()->SendDiscoverNewTaxiNode(5678);\
      \ // Unlock specific taxi node\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player actually discovers a new
    taxi node. The client will automatically update its UI to reflect the newly discovered
    node. Ensure that the nodeid parameter corresponds to an actual taxi node in the
    game's database, otherwise the packet may not display correctly or could cause
    client-side issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid node ID may result in client-side
    errors or visual glitches. Always validate that the node exists before sending
    the discovery notification. This method should not be called repeatedly for the
    same node as it will cause unnecessary network traffic and potential UI flickering.
