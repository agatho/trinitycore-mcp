  class: AuctionManager
  method: RegisterBotAuction
  signature: void AuctionManager::RegisterBotAuction(Player * bot, uint32 auctionId,
    const BotAuctionData & data)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot auction with the specified auction data for the given player.
  description: The RegisterBotAuction method is used to register an auction created
    by a bot player within the TrinityCore AuctionHouse system. This function associates
    the auction ID with the provided bot player and auction data, allowing the auction
    to be properly managed and tracked in the game's auction system. The method likely
    updates internal data structures to maintain consistency between the bot's auction
    records and the global auction house database. It is typically invoked when a
    bot player places an item for auction, ensuring that the auction is correctly
    registered with all necessary metadata.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is creating
      the auction. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier for the auction being registered. This ID should
      correspond to an existing auction in the system and must be a positive integer.
  - name: data
    description: Reference to BotAuctionData structure containing all relevant information
      about the auction, including item details, bid amounts, and other metadata required
      for bot auctions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Auction Registration
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player

      uint32 auctionId = 12345;

      BotAuctionData auctionData;

      auctionData.itemEntry = 12345;

      auctionData.startBid = 1000;

      auctionData.buyoutPrice = 5000;

      AuctionManager::instance()->RegisterBotAuction(myBot, auctionId, auctionData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of the provided auction data
    and ensures that the bot player has proper permissions to create auctions. It
    may also trigger additional system events or callbacks related to auction creation.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also verify that the
    auction ID is unique and not already in use by another auction.
