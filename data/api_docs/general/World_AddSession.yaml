  class: World
  method: AddSession
  signature: void World::AddSession(WorldSession * s)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new WorldSession to the active sessions list for handling client connections.
  description: The AddSession method is responsible for registering a new WorldSession
    object within the World class, allowing it to manage and process network communications
    with a connected client. This method typically gets invoked during the login process
    when a player successfully authenticates and establishes a connection to the server.
    It ensures that the session is properly tracked and integrated into the server's
    session management system, enabling further interaction such as sending packets,
    handling commands, and maintaining game state synchronization. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input session pointer; it assumes the provided
    pointer is valid and properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: s
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object that needs to be added to the
      active sessions list. This parameter must not be null and should represent a
      valid, initialized session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a new session after successful authentication
    code: "WorldSession* newSession = new WorldSession(0, \"127.0.0.1\", 8085);\n\
      // ... perform authentication logic ...\nif (authenticationSuccessful)\n{\n\
      \    sWorld->AddSession(newSession);\n    // Session is now registered and ready\
      \ to handle packets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the login handling code path.
    It's important to note that while this method adds a session to the internal tracking
    list, it does not automatically start processing incoming data for that session
    - additional setup may be required depending on the implementation details of
    the WorldSession class.
