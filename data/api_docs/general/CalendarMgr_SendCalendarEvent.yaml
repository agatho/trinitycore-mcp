  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarEvent(int guid, const CalendarEvent & calendarEvent,
    CalendarSendEventType sendType) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event to the specified player with the given send type.
  description: The SendCalendarEvent method is responsible for transmitting calendar
    event data to a specific player client in the World of Warcraft game. It takes
    a player's GUID, a CalendarEvent object containing the event details, and a CalendarSendEventType
    enum value that determines how the event should be sent (e.g., invite, update,
    etc.). This method is typically used by the server to notify players about calendar
    events such as raids, dungeons, or other group activities. The method operates
    on the calendar manager instance and does not return any value. It's part of the
    TrinityCore's calendar system implementation which allows for event management
    within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to whom the calendar event
      will be sent. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's object
      ID in the game world.
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A constant reference to a CalendarEvent object containing all the
      details of the calendar event to be sent, including title, description, time,
      type, and other relevant metadata.
  - name: sendType
    description: An enum value of type CalendarSendEventType that specifies how the
      event should be handled by the client. This determines whether it's an invitation,
      update, or another type of calendar notification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a raid event to a player
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      event.title = "Raid: Blackwing Descent";

      event.description = "Weekly raid for new content";

      event.eventType = CALENDAR_EVENT_TYPE_RAID;

      CalendarMgr::instance()->SendCalendarEvent(playerGuid, event, CALENDAR_SEND_TYPE_INVITE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves network communication to send data to the client.
    It may be called from various parts of the game logic when calendar events need
    to be communicated to players. The CalendarSendEventType enum values are important
    for proper client-side handling of event notifications.
