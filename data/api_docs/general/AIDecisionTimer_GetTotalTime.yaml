  class: AIDecisionTimer
  method: GetTotalTime
  signature: uint64_t AIDecisionTimer::GetTotalTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total elapsed time since the AI decision timer was started.
  description: The GetTotalTime method retrieves the cumulative time in milliseconds
    that has passed since this AIDecisionTimer instance was initialized or last reset.
    This timer is typically used within AI behavior systems to track timing for decision-making
    processes, such as when an NPC should perform a specific action based on time
    intervals. The returned value represents the total duration and does not include
    any paused or inactive periods unless explicitly handled by the internal implementation.
    This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where the timer
    instance is accessible.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the total elapsed time in milliseconds since
    the timer was started or last reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check AI Decision Timeout
    code: "AIDecisionTimer timer;\n// ... some logic ...\nuint64_t totalTime = timer.GetTotalTime();\n\
      if (totalTime > 5000) // 5 seconds\n{\n    // Perform AI decision\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Total Time for Conditional Behavior
    code: "AIDecisionTimer timer;\nuint64_t elapsed = timer.GetTotalTime();\nif (elapsed\
      \ > 3000 && elapsed < 6000)\n{\n    // Execute specific behavior during mid-time\
      \ window\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the timer has been properly initialized and started.
    The internal implementation may use high-resolution timing functions for accuracy,
    typically relying on system clocks or game tick counters in TrinityCore environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the AIDecisionTimer instance is valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. If the timer was never started or has been
    reset, the returned value will reflect only the time since the last reset point.
