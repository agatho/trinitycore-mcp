  brief: Triggers celebration events for guild achievements.
  description: The CelebrateGuildAchievements method is responsible for handling the
    visual and functional celebration of guild achievements within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method likely manages the display of achievement rewards, updates
    guild member statistics, and may trigger related in-game events such as announcements
    or cosmetic effects. The method operates on a per-guild basis and typically requires
    that the guild has recently earned an achievement that qualifies for celebration.
    It does not take any parameters and is designed to be called internally by the
    game's achievement system when appropriate.

    achievements. It may interact with database systems to update achievement records
    and communicate with the client to display celebration effects.
