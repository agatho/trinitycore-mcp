  signature: void Player::SetTraitConfigUseStarterBuild(int32 traitConfigId, bool
    useStarterBuild)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the trait configuration to use starter build for the player.
  description: This method configures the player's trait system to utilize a starter
    build for the specified trait configuration ID. It allows developers to control
    which trait build is active for the player, typically used during character creation
    or when setting up initial trait configurations. The method modifies internal
    player state and may affect gameplay mechanics related to trait points and specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: traitConfigId
    description: The unique identifier of the trait configuration to set. This represents
      a specific trait tree configuration that can be used for the player's starter
      build.
  - name: useStarterBuild
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to activate the starter build for
      the specified trait configuration. True enables the starter build, false disables
      it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting up a starter build for a specific trait configuration
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetTraitConfigUseStarterBuild(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state related to trait points
    and specialization. It should be used carefully during character creation or when
    setting up initial configurations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect trait configurations,
    potentially affecting gameplay mechanics related to trait points allocation and
    specialization.
