  signature: void SmoothPhasing::SetSingleInfo(const SmoothPhasingInfo & info)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the single phasing information for a smooth phasing operation
  description: The SetSingleInfo method configures the phasing parameters for a single
    object or entity within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with phasing systems that manage visibility and interaction between
    players, creatures, and game objects in different phases. It allows developers
    to define specific phasing behaviors for individual entities, ensuring proper
    synchronization of visual and gameplay elements during phase transitions. The
    method operates on a provided SmoothPhasingInfo structure which contains all necessary
    configuration data for the phasing operation.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: A constant reference to a SmoothPhasingInfo structure containing
      the phasing configuration parameters for the single entity
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetSingleInfo
    code: 'SmoothPhasingInfo info;

      info.phaseId = 12345;

      info.flags = PHASE_FLAG_NORMAL;

      info.duration = 5000;

      smoothPhasing.SetSingleInfo(info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting up phased visibility for a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      SmoothPhasingInfo info;

      info.phaseId = creature->GetPhaseMask();

      info.flags = PHASE_FLAG_VISIBLE;

      info.duration = 3000;

      smoothPhasing.SetSingleInfo(info);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any phasing operations. The
    SmoothPhasingInfo structure must contain valid configuration data, otherwise the
    phasing behavior may not work as expected. The method does not perform validation
    on the input parameters and assumes that all required fields are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the SmoothPhasingInfo
    structure can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect phasing results. Ensure
    that phase IDs and flags are valid for the current game context, as invalid values
    may cause visual glitches or gameplay inconsistencies.
