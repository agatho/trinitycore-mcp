documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LocationInfo class with default values.
  description: The LocationInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the LocationInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new LocationInfo object to ensure all member
    variables are properly initialized before use. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, LocationInfo objects are commonly used to represent
    spatial coordinates and associated metadata within the game world. The constructor
    ensures that all location-related properties are in a valid initial state, preventing
    undefined behavior when accessing location data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic LocationInfo Construction
    code: 'LocationInfo info;

      // Creates a new LocationInfo object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using LocationInfo in World Object Context
    code: "class GameObject : public WorldObject\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdatePosition()\n\
      \    {\n        LocationInfo newLocation;\n        // Use newLocation for position\
      \ calculations\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs basic initialization of member variables but does
    not set specific location coordinates. Developers should ensure that any required
    coordinate data is set after construction using appropriate setter methods or
    assignment operations. This class likely forms part of a larger system for managing
    object positions in the game world.
