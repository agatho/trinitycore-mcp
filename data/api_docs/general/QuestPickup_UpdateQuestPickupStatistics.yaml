  class: QuestPickup
  method: UpdateQuestPickupStatistics
  signature: void QuestPickup::UpdateQuestPickupStatistics(uint32 botGuid, bool wasSuccessful,
    uint32 timeSpent)
documentation:
  brief: Updates quest pickup statistics for a bot based on pickup success and time
    spent.
  description: The UpdateQuestPickupStatistics method records and updates statistical
    data related to quest pickups performed by a bot character. It tracks whether
    a quest pickup was successful and the amount of time spent during the process.
    This method is typically used in automated questing systems or botting frameworks
    within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The statistics collected may
    be used for performance analysis, bot behavior optimization, or administrative
    monitoring purposes. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    tracking structures to reflect the latest pickup event.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character performing the
      quest pickup operation.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the quest pickup was successful (true)
      or failed (false).
  - name: timeSpent
    description: The amount of time (in milliseconds) spent performing the quest pickup
      operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.UpdateQuestPickupStatistics(12345, true, 2500);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Pickup Tracking
    code: 'QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.UpdateQuestPickupStatistics(67890, false, 1500);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest automation or botting framework.
    It assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing bot character in
    the system. The internal statistics tracking mechanism may involve database writes
    or in-memory data structures depending on the implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to a valid bot character to avoid
    unintended behavior or errors. Incorrect timeSpent values could skew statistical
    analysis results.
