api:
  class: ArenaTeam
  method: SetCaptain
  signature: void ArenaTeam::SetCaptain(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the captain of the arena team to the player with the specified GUID.
  description: The SetCaptain method assigns a new captain to the arena team by updating
    the team's captain GUID. This operation typically occurs when promoting or demoting
    a team member to the role of captain, which grants them special privileges such
    as managing team members and setting team disband status. The method does not
    validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to an actual team member, so it
    is expected that the caller ensures the GUID refers to a valid player within the
    arena team. This change is usually persisted in the database and propagated to
    all online team members.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become the new
      captain of the arena team.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Promote Player to Captain
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->SetCaptain(56789);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal team state and should be called only when appropriate
    permissions are verified. Changes made by this function may trigger synchronization
    updates across the server to reflect the new captain status.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-team member GUID can lead to
    undefined behavior or inconsistencies in team management. Ensure that the GUID
    corresponds to a valid player currently in the arena team before invoking this
    method.
