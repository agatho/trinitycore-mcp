documentation:
  brief: Initiates the casting of the Obsidian Scales ability for an Evoker AI.
  description: The CastObsidianScales method is responsible for executing the casting
    behavior of the Obsidian Scales spell within the EvokerAI class. This method likely
    handles the logic required to trigger the spell's effects, including any necessary
    cooldown management, target selection, and animation playback. The ability is
    a key defensive mechanism for Evokers in World of Warcraft, providing damage reduction
    and other beneficial effects. It is typically called during combat when the AI
    determines it is appropriate to use this ability based on current health status
    or threat levels.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f)\n\
      \    {\n        CastObsidianScales();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Evoker is in combat and has sufficient
    mana to cast the spell. The AI logic should ensure that Obsidian Scales is not
    cast too frequently to avoid spamming the ability.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or without proper conditions may
    result in unexpected behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that the target and
    casting conditions are properly validated before invoking this method.
