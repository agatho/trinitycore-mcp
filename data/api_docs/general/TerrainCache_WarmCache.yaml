documentation:
  brief: Preloads terrain data into memory for specified positions and phase shifts
    to improve performance during world updates.
  description: The WarmCache method is designed to pre-load terrain data for specific
    positions and phase shifts within the TrinityCore world system. This optimization
    technique helps reduce latency during dynamic world updates by ensuring that required
    terrain information is already resident in memory. The method takes two integer
    parameters representing position coordinates and phase shift values, which determine
    the scope of terrain data to be cached. It's typically used during server initialization
    or when preparing for high-traffic events where rapid access to terrain information
    is critical. The caching mechanism improves overall world update performance by
    minimizing disk I/O operations and memory allocation overhead during active gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: positions
    description: An integer value representing the position coordinates or identifier
      used to determine which terrain data should be pre-loaded into cache. This parameter
      likely corresponds to specific map tile positions or grid coordinates within
      the game world.
  - name: phaseShift
    description: An integer value indicating the phase shift context for terrain caching.
      This parameter may control which phase of terrain data (such as different environmental
      states, seasonal variations, or dynamic changes) should be loaded into memory
      for optimal performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Terrain Cache Warming
    code: 'TerrainCache* cache = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainCache();

      cache->WarmCache(100, 2);

      // Pre-loads terrain data for position 100 with phase shift 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Bulk Terrain Cache Warming for Multiple Positions
    code: "TerrainCache* cache = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainCache();\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 1000; ++i)\n{\n    cache->WarmCache(i, i % 4);\n}\n// Warms cache for\
      \ 1000 positions with varying phase shifts"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during server startup or maintenance periods
    to optimize performance. The caching process may block execution until completion,
    so it's recommended to call this method asynchronously or during low-traffic periods.
    The effectiveness of terrain caching depends on the specific map configurations
    and the frequency of terrain data access patterns in the game world.
  warnings: Calling WarmCache with invalid position values or excessive phase shift
    parameters may result in unnecessary memory allocation or performance degradation.
    This method should not be called excessively during normal gameplay operations
    as it can cause temporary performance spikes due to memory management overhead.
