documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's phase based on spell effects and triggers phase-related
    events.
  description: The EffectUpdatePlayerPhase method is responsible for updating a player's
    current phase in response to spell effects. This method typically handles phase
    changes that occur during spell casting or application, ensuring that the player's
    visual and gameplay state aligns with the spell's intended phase behavior. It
    may modify the player's phase mask, trigger phase-related events, and update client-side
    visibility settings. The method is usually invoked as part of a spell's effect
    execution sequence within the TrinityCore spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Handler
    code: "void Spell::EffectUpdatePlayerPhase()\n{\n    if (GetCaster() && GetCaster()->IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        Player* player = GetCaster()->ToPlayer();\n        // Update\
      \ player phase based on spell effects\n        player->UpdatePhase();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during effect
    application. Developers should ensure that any custom phase logic is properly
    integrated with the core TrinityCore phase management system to avoid conflicts
    or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method may lead to visual inconsistencies
    for players, such as incorrect visibility of objects or NPCs in different phases.
    Ensure that all phase changes are consistent with the spell's intended gameplay
    effect and do not break existing phase-based mechanics.
