  class: InstanceLock
  method: GetInstanceId
  signature: uint32 InstanceLock::GetInstanceId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique instance identifier associated with this instance lock.
  description: The GetInstanceId method returns the uint32 identifier that uniquely
    represents a specific instance within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier
    is typically used to distinguish between different instances of the same map or
    dungeon, especially in scenarios involving multiple concurrent runs such as raids
    or heroic dungeons. The returned value corresponds to the instance ID stored internally
    by the server and is essential for managing player access, tracking instance state,
    and ensuring proper synchronization of game objects and events within a specific
    instance context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the instance associated
    with this InstanceLock object. This identifier is used internally by the server
    to manage instance-specific data and player access.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();

      uint32 instanceId = lock->GetInstanceId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Player is in instance %u", instanceId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Validity
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nif (lock && lock->GetInstanceId()\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Valid instance ID: %u\", lock->GetInstanceId());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"No valid instance lock found\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called on an InstanceLock object that has already
    been initialized with a valid instance context. The returned instance ID should
    not be modified directly, as it's managed by the server's instance management
    system. Performance-wise, this is a fast operation as it simply returns a cached
    value.
  warnings: Ensure that the InstanceLock object is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that an instance ID of 0 may indicate either no active instance or an uninitialized
    lock state.
