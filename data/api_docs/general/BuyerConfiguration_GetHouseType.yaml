documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house type associated with the buyer configuration.
  description: The GetHouseType method returns the AuctionHouseType enumeration value
    that represents the specific type of auction house this buyer configuration is
    associated with. This is commonly used in auction house-related systems to determine
    the behavior and rules applicable to a particular auction house, such as whether
    it's for items, glyphs, or other specific categories. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AuctionHouseType enumeration value indicating the type of auction house
    this configuration represents. Possible values may include AH_TYPE_ITEM, AH_TYPE_GLYPH,
    etc., depending on the implementation and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BuyerConfiguration config;\nAuctionHouseType type = config.GetHouseType();\n\
      if (type == AH_TYPE_ITEM)\n{\n    // Handle item auction house logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other buyer configuration
    methods to fully define the behavior of an auction house buyer. It's a read-only
    accessor and should not be called in performance-critical sections without consideration
    for caching.
