documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the UnitAssistActionData object.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the UnitAssistActionData instance. This mask is typically used to track which
    properties or fields of the assist action data have been modified since the last
    update or synchronization. Clearing the mask effectively marks all fields as unmodified,
    allowing for clean state management in AI decision-making processes within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method does not take any parameters and has no return
    value.

    code: 'UnitAssistActionData assistData;

      assistData.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI behavior systems where tracking state
    changes is important for performance optimization and ensuring that only relevant
    data is processed or sent to clients. It's typically called after applying changes
    or before starting a new cycle of action evaluation.
