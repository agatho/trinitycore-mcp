  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns for the Death Knight AI.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for activating and
    managing defensive abilities and cooldowns within the Death Knight's AI behavior.
    This method evaluates the current combat situation and applies appropriate defensive
    measures such as Death Strike, Bone Shield, or other cooldowns that help mitigate
    incoming damage or sustain the Death Knight during intense fights. It typically
    integrates with the overall AI decision-making loop to ensure optimal use of defensive
    resources based on health status, threat level, and available cooldowns.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n\
      \    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f)\n        UseDefensiveCooldowns();\n   \
      \ // Continue with other logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during the AI update cycle when certain conditions
    are met, such as low health or high threat level. It's important to ensure that
    defensive cooldowns are not used unnecessarily to preserve their effectiveness
    in critical moments.
