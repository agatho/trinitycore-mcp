  class: Guild
  method: _GetRankRights
  signature: uint32 Guild::_GetRankRights(GuildRankId rankId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the rights bitmask associated with a specified guild rank.
  description: The _GetRankRights method returns the rights bitmask for a given guild
    rank ID. This bitmask defines what actions a guild member with that rank is permitted
    to perform within the guild, such as inviting members, removing members, or modifying
    guild information. The returned value is a packed set of flags that correspond
    to specific guild permissions. This method is typically used internally by the
    TrinityCore server to validate guild operations and ensure proper access control
    based on player rank.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask representing the rights granted to the specified guild
    rank. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific permission, such as the ability
    to invite members, remove members, or manage guild banks. The exact meaning of
    each bit is defined by the GuildRankFlags enum within the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve rights for the guild leader rank
    code: 'uint32 rights = guild->_GetRankRights(GUILD_RANK_ID_LEADER);

      // Returns a bitmask with all permissions enabled for the guild leader rank'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a rank has the ability to invite members
    code: 'uint32 rights = guild->_GetRankRights(GUILD_RANK_ID_OFFICER);

      bool canInvite = (rights & GUILD_RANK_RIGHT_INVITE) != 0;

      // Evaluates to true if the officer rank allows inviting new members'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the TrinityCore server and
    should not be called directly from external modules. The bitmask values are defined
    by the GuildRankFlags enumeration, which may vary between different versions of
    the core. Performance-wise, this method performs a simple lookup in an internal
    data structure and is therefore very fast.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned bitmask directly as it represents internal
    state. Modifications to guild rank rights should be performed through appropriate
    guild management functions. Incorrectly interpreting the bitmask bits may lead
    to unexpected behavior or security issues in guild operations.
