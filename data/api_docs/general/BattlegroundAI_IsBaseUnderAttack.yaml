documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified base location in a battleground is currently under
    attack.
  description: The IsBaseUnderAttack method determines whether a specific base location
    within a battleground is currently being attacked by enemy players or NPCs. This
    method is typically used by battleground AI systems to make strategic decisions
    regarding resource allocation, defense priorities, and tactical responses. The
    method takes a base location identifier as input and returns true if that base
    is under active attack, false otherwise. It's commonly utilized in battleground
    scripts to trigger defensive mechanisms, alert players, or modify game state based
    on the current combat situation at different base locations.
  parameters:
  - name: baseLocation
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific base location within
      the battleground. Valid values typically correspond to predefined base indices
      (e.g., 0 for Alliance base, 1 for Horde base, or other location-specific identifiers
      depending on the battleground type). The exact range and meaning of these identifiers
      are determined by the specific battleground implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the specified base location is currently under attack by
    enemy forces, false if it is not under attack. This boolean value indicates the
    immediate combat state of the base for strategic decision-making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI
    code: "if (bgAI->IsBaseUnderAttack(0)) {\n    // Handle Alliance base under attack\n\
      \    bgAI->CallForHelp(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategic Response Based on Base Attack Status
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsBaseUnderAttack(BASE_HALL))\
      \ {\n        // Prioritize defense of the hall\n        SetPriorityDefense(BASE_HALL);\n\
      \    } else if (IsBaseUnderAttack(BASE_MINES)) {\n        // Send reinforcements\
      \ to mines\n        SendReinforcements(BASE_MINES);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal battleground state tracking and may
    be updated during the battleground's update cycle. The baseLocation parameter
    should correspond to valid base identifiers defined within the specific battleground
    type. Implementation details may vary between different battleground types (e.g.,
    Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin) as each has its own set of base locations.
  warnings: Ensure that the baseLocation parameter corresponds to a valid base identifier
    for the current battleground type, as invalid values may cause undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. This method should only be called during active battleground
    sessions when base states are being tracked.
