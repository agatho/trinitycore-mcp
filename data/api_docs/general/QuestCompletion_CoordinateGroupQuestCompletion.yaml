  class: QuestCompletion
  method: CoordinateGroupQuestCompletion
  signature: void QuestCompletion::CoordinateGroupQuestCompletion(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates quest completion for all members of a group.
  description: The CoordinateGroupQuestCompletion method ensures that all players
    within a specified group are marked as having completed a given quest. This is
    typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to synchronize quest
    progress across multiple players in a party or raid. The method iterates through
    each group member and triggers the appropriate quest completion logic for the
    provided quest ID. It handles cases where players may be in different zones or
    instances, ensuring consistent quest state updates throughout the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest progress
      needs to be updated. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with
      at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to be marked as completed for all
      group members. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Completion
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::CoordinateGroupQuestCompletion(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Quest Completion
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    uint32 questId = sObjectMgr->GetQuestForPlayer(player, \"SomeQuestName\"\
      );\n    if (questId != 0)\n    {\n        QuestCompletion::CoordinateGroupQuestCompletion(group,\
      \ questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are within the same instance or
    zone where the quest completion should take effect. It does not handle cross-instance
    synchronization automatically. The method internally uses TrinityCore's quest
    system to update player states and may trigger related quest events such as objective
    updates or reward distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash. Also, verify that the questId
    exists in the database; otherwise, the method might not perform any meaningful
    actions. This function should only be called when the group is fully formed and
    all members are accounted for.
