  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleAutoLoot(Group * group, const LootItem &
    item)
documentation:
  brief: Processes automatic loot distribution for a group member when looting an
    item.
  description: The HandleAutoLoot method manages the automatic distribution of loot
    items to group members in a World of Warcraft instance. It is typically invoked
    during group loot scenarios where items are distributed according to the group's
    loot rules, such as round-robin or free-for-all. This method ensures that the
    correct player receives the item based on the current loot distribution settings
    and group composition. The function operates within the TrinityCore framework
    and integrates with the broader loot management system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that is looting.
      Must be a valid group instance; null pointer will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being distributed. The item must have valid loot data and be part of
      the group's current loot pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a loot handler
    code: "void MyLootHandler::ProcessLoot(Group* group, LootItem const& item)\n{\n\
      \    LootDistribution::HandleAutoLoot(group, item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom loot rules
    code: "void CustomLootSystem::DistributeItem(Group* group, LootItem const& item)\n\
      {\n    if (group && item.is_looted)\n    {\n        LootDistribution::HandleAutoLoot(group,\
      \ item);\n        // Additional logic for custom distribution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot distribution system and should not
    be called directly from outside the core loot management classes. It assumes that
    the group and item parameters are valid and properly initialized. The method may
    modify internal state variables related to loot tracking and player assignment.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null parameters can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group object is active and contains valid
    members before invoking this function. This method does not perform any validation
    on the item's looting status, so callers should verify item validity beforehand.
