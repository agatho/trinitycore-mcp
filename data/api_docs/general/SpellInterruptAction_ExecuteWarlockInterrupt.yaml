  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteWarlockInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteWarlockInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the bot is a warlock and the
    spell can be interrupted.
  description: The ExecuteWarlockInterrupt method attempts to interrupt an enemy unit's
    ongoing spell cast by a warlock bot. It checks whether the specified spell ID
    is interruptible, verifies that the target is currently casting a spell, and then
    applies the appropriate interrupt mechanics. This method is typically used in
    AI decision-making logic to respond to enemy spell casts. The method returns an
    ActionResult indicating success or failure of the interruption attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the warlock bot performing
      the interrupt.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      is to be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast by the target that should be interrupted.
      Must correspond to a valid spell in the game database.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating whether the interrupt was successful,
    failed, or had no effect. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or NO_TARGET.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warlock Interrupt Usage
    code: "BotAI* ai = bot->GetBotAI();\nUnit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nuint32 spellId\
      \ = 12345; // Example spell ID\nActionResult result = SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteWarlockInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, spellId);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    ai->GetBot()->GetAI()->Talk(\"\
      Interrupted!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is a warlock and has appropriate permissions
    to interrupt spells. It does not validate whether the target unit is actually
    casting a spell; it relies on the caller to ensure this condition. The spellId
    must be valid for the game's spell system.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is actively casting a spell before calling
    this method, as attempting to interrupt a non-casting unit may lead to undefined
    behavior or errors. Also, make sure that the bot AI has sufficient permissions
    and resources to perform the interrupt action.
