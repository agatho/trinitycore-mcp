  signature: void GameObjectTypeBase::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the game object's state based on the time delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing the game object's behavior
    and state changes during each update cycle. It typically handles animations, AI
    logic, interaction handling, and other time-dependent operations. This method
    is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that the GameObject remains synchronized
    with the current game state. The diff parameter represents the time elapsed since
    the last update in milliseconds, which is used to calculate smooth transitions
    and timing-based events.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to determine how much time has passed for interpolation, animation timing,
      and event scheduling.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic GameObject Update Usage
    code: "void MyGameObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Perform basic update\
      \ logic\n    GameObjectTypeBase::Update(diff);\n    \n    // Custom update code\
      \ here\n    if (m_timer > 0)\n        m_timer -= diff;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void AdvancedGameObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    GameObjectTypeBase::Update(diff);\n\
      \    \n    // Handle different update states\n    switch (m_state)\n    {\n\
      \        case STATE_IDLE:\n            if (CheckActivationCondition())\n   \
      \             m_state = STATE_ACTIVE;\n            break;\n        case STATE_ACTIVE:\n\
      \            ProcessActiveLogic(diff);\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should not block
    or perform heavy computations. It's important to keep update logic efficient to
    maintain good performance. The diff parameter ensures that updates are frame-rate
    independent, allowing for consistent behavior across different hardware configurations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand its implications
    in the context of the game loop. Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead
    to inconsistent timing and visual artifacts. Avoid performing long-running operations
    within this method as it may cause frame drops or game lag.
