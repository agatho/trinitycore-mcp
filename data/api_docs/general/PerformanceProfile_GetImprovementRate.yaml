documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the improvement rate for performance profiling metrics
  description: The GetImprovementRate method computes the rate at which performance
    metrics have improved over a specified period or interval. This value is typically
    used in profiling systems to determine how effectively optimizations are reducing
    performance bottlenecks or improving execution times. The method does not take
    any parameters and returns a floating-point value representing the improvement
    rate as a percentage or normalized metric. It is commonly invoked within performance
    monitoring tools and diagnostic systems to track progress of optimization efforts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated improvement rate. This value
    typically indicates the percentage change in performance metrics over time, where
    positive values suggest improvements and negative values indicate regressions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      float improvement = profile.GetImprovementRate();

      std::cout << "Improvement rate: " << improvement << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorPerformance()\n{\n    PerformanceProfile profile;\n    float\
      \ rate = profile.GetImprovementRate();\n    if (rate > 0.0f)\n    {\n      \
      \  std::cout << \"Performance improved by \" << rate << \"%\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Performance degraded or unchanged\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance profiling framework and
    may rely on internal tracking mechanisms to calculate improvement rates. The implementation
    might cache previous measurements or use statistical methods to determine trends
    over time.
  warnings: The returned value should be interpreted in context with the measurement
    period and baseline data used for comparison. Without proper initialization or
    historical data, this method may return inaccurate or misleading values.
