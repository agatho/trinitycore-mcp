  method: operator==
  signature: bool ChaseMovementParams::operator==(const ChaseMovementParams & other)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ChaseMovementParams objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    ChaseMovementParams object and another ChaseMovementParams object to determine
    if they are identical. This comparison checks all relevant fields that define
    the movement parameters for chasing behavior in the game AI system. The method
    is typically used to verify whether two chase movement configurations are equivalent,
    which can be important when managing AI behavior states or determining if a change
    in movement parameters has occurred.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The ChaseMovementParams object to compare against this instance.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid chase movement
      configuration.
  returns: Returns true if all members of both ChaseMovementParams objects are equal;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check
    code: 'ChaseMovementParams params1;

      ChaseMovementParams params2;

      bool isEqual = (params1 == params2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking movement parameter changes
    code: "ChaseMovementParams oldParams = GetChaseParameters();\nUpdateChaseParameters();\n\
      ChaseMovementParams newParams = GetChaseParameters();\nif (oldParams != newParams)\
      \ {\n    // Movement parameters have changed, update AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is implemented using member-wise comparison, which means all
    fields in the ChaseMovementParams structure must be comparable for meaningful
    results. The implementation assumes that the class has properly defined equality
    operators for its member types.
