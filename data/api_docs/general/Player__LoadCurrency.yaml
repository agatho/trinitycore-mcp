  brief: Loads currency data for the player from the database
  description: This method initializes and loads currency information for the player
    character from the database. It typically handles the retrieval of currency data
    including coins, reputation items, and other in-game currency types that are stored
    in the database. The method is part of the player's initialization process and
    ensures that currency data is properly loaded before the player can interact with
    currency systems. This method is usually called during player loading or when
    currency data needs to be refreshed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during player initialization.
    It may involve database queries and should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to currency data inconsistencies
    or missing currency items in the player's inventory.
