  method: IsMixedGroup
  signature: bool GroupIntegration::IsMixedGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group contains players from different factions.
  description: The IsMixedGroup method checks if a given Group object contains players
    from more than one faction (typically Horde and Alliance). This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft gameplay logic to enforce faction-based restrictions, such
    as preventing cross-faction grouping in certain scenarios or determining if a
    group can participate in specific quests or instances. The method evaluates the
    faction affiliations of all group members and returns true if mixed factions are
    detected, false otherwise. It's particularly relevant for maintaining game balance
    and enforcing faction-specific rules within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group contains players from different factions (e.g.,
    both Horde and Alliance), false if all members belong to the same faction or if
    the group is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group has mixed factions
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup && GroupIntegration::IsMixedGroup(myGroup))\
      \ {\n    // Handle mixed faction group logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning:\
      \ Mixed faction group detected!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the faction data stored in each player's record within
    the group. Performance is generally low as it iterates through all group members
    to determine faction affiliations. The method may not account for temporary faction
    changes or special game states that could affect faction detection.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths,
    as it may iterate through all group members. Also, ensure the Group pointer is
    valid before calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
