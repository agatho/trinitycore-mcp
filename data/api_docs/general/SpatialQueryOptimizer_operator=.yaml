    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one SpatialQueryOptimizer object to another
  description: The assignment operator for SpatialQueryOptimizer performs a deep copy
    of all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This
    method is essential for managing object state when copying SpatialQueryOptimizer
    instances, particularly in scenarios involving spatial queries and collision detection
    within the TrinityCore framework. The operation ensures that both objects maintain
    independent copies of their data while preserving the same query configuration
    and optimization state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpatialQueryOptimizer object to copy from
  returns: A reference to the current SpatialQueryOptimizer object after assignment,
    enabling chained assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer optimizer1;

      SpatialQueryOptimizer optimizer2 = optimizer1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      optimizer2 = optimizer1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer opt1, opt2, opt3;

      // Perform some operations on opt1...

      opt1 = opt2 = opt3; // Chained assignment

      // All three objects now contain the same data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to ensure that internal spatial
    query structures and optimization data are properly duplicated. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments where spatial queries
    may occur concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large SpatialQueryOptimizer objects as the
    operation may involve significant memory allocation and copying of internal data
    structures. Ensure proper resource management to avoid performance degradation.
