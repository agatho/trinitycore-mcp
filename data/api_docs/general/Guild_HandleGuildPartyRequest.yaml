documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild party request from a player session.
  description: The HandleGuildPartyRequest method is responsible for handling incoming
    guild party requests from players within the World of Warcraft client. This method
    typically receives a WorldSession object containing the requesting player's data
    and processes the request to either join or create a guild party. It validates
    the session, checks player permissions, and manages the party creation or joining
    logic according to guild rules and player status. The method operates within the
    TrinityCore framework's networking and guild management systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Party Request Handling
    code: "void example() {\n    WorldSession* session = new WorldSession();\n   \
      \ Guild* guild = new Guild();\n    guild->HandleGuildPartyRequest(session);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the network packet handling system
    when a player sends a guild party request. It assumes proper session validation
    has already occurred and focuses on business logic for party management within
    guild context.
  warnings: Improper session handling before calling this method may lead to undefined
    behavior or security vulnerabilities. Ensure that all session validations are
    performed prior to invoking this method.
