  brief: Cancels the current spell being cast by the caster
  description: The Spell::cancel method is used to interrupt and cancel the currently
    active spell being cast by a caster. This method typically resets the spell's
    casting state, effectively stopping any ongoing spell animation or effects. It
    is commonly used in scenarios where a spell needs to be interrupted due to player
    movement, combat changes, or other game mechanics that require spell cancellation.
    The method does not necessarily remove the spell from the player's spellbook but
    rather stops the spell's execution process.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellId);

      spell->cancel();

      // This cancels the spell being cast by the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect spell casting states
    and may cause issues if called during certain spell execution phases. It is recommended
    to use this method only when necessary, such as when interrupting a spell due
    to movement or combat changes.
