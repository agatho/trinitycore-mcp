  class: GridInfo
  method: GridInfo
  signature: void GridInfo::GridInfo(time_t expiry, bool unload)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GridInfo object with specified expiry time and unload behavior.
  description: The GridInfo constructor initializes a grid information structure with
    the provided expiry timestamp and unload flag. This method sets up internal state
    for managing grid lifecycle, including when the grid should expire and whether
    it should be unloaded from memory. The expiry parameter determines the time at
    which the grid is considered stale, while the unload flag controls if the grid
    data should be removed from memory upon expiration. This initialization is crucial
    for maintaining efficient memory usage and proper world object management in TrinityCore's
    grid-based world system.
  parameters:
  - name: expiry
    description: The time_t value representing when this grid should expire. This
      timestamp determines the grid's lifetime in the world system.
  - name: unload
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the grid should be unloaded from
      memory when it expires. True enables automatic unloading, false keeps it in
      memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GridInfo Initialization
    code: GridInfo info(time(nullptr) + 3600, true); // Expire in 1 hour and unload
    language: cpp
  - title: GridInfo with Delayed Unload
    code: 'time_t futureTime = time(nullptr) + 7200; // 2 hours from now

      GridInfo info(futureTime, false); // Expire in 2 hours but don''t unload'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the grid management system.
    The expiry time should be set to a future timestamp using standard C time functions
    like time(nullptr). GridInfo objects are usually managed automatically by TrinityCore's
    core systems rather than being instantiated directly by custom code.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of GridInfo objects should generally be avoided in
    favor of using the grid management system's built-in mechanisms. Incorrect expiry
    times or unload flags can lead to memory leaks or premature grid unloading, affecting
    world object visibility and performance.
