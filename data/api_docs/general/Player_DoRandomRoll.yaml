  class: Player
  method: DoRandomRoll
  signature: uint32 Player::DoRandomRoll(uint32 minimum, uint32 maximum)
documentation:
  brief: Rolls a random number between minimum and maximum values for the player.
  description: The DoRandomRoll method generates a random number within a specified
    range for the player character. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as loot rolling, chance calculations, or when determining random outcomes
    for various in-game events. It typically returns a value between the minimum and
    maximum parameters, inclusive of both bounds. The method is often used in conjunction
    with other player-related functions to determine random outcomes in World of Warcraft's
    gameplay systems.
  parameters:
  - name: minimum
    description: The lower bound of the random range. This value represents the minimum
      possible result from the roll.
  - name: maximum
    description: The upper bound of the random range. This value represents the maximum
      possible result from the roll.
  returns: Returns a random integer between minimum and maximum values, inclusive.
    The returned value will be within the specified range and may represent various
    outcomes depending on the context in which it is used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 roll = player->DoRandomRoll(1, 100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot rolling example
    code: "uint32 lootRoll = player->DoRandomRoll(1, 100);\nif (lootRoll <= 50) {\n\
      \    // Player gets item\n} else {\n    // Player doesn't get item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in game mechanics where randomization is required,
    such as loot rolling or chance calculations. It's important to note that the method
    may be used in different contexts depending on the specific implementation within
    TrinityCore. Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple random
    number generation.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method for game mechanics involving
    randomization, as improper use can lead to unbalanced gameplay or unexpected outcomes.
    Ensure that the range values are correctly set to avoid unintended results.
