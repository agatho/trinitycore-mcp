  signature: bool Item::IsBoundAccountWide() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is bound to an account-wide account.
  description: This method checks if the item is bound to an account-wide account,
    meaning it can be used by any character on the same account. This is typically
    used for items that are bound to a specific account rather than to individual
    characters. The method returns true if the item is bound account-wide, false otherwise.
    It's commonly used in game mechanics to determine item ownership and usage restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is bound account-wide, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the item can be used by any character on the same account.
  examples:
  - title: Check Account-Wide Binding
    code: "if (item->IsBoundAccountWide()) {\n    // Item can be used by any character\
      \ on the account\n}\nelse {\n    // Item is bound to a specific character\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal flags or data
    structures within the item object that determine account-wide binding. Performance
    considerations: This method should be fast as it typically involves simple flag
    checking operations.'
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an item is bound to a character,
    as there are separate methods for that. Be careful when using this in conjunction
    with other binding checks as it may lead to incorrect assumptions about item ownership.
