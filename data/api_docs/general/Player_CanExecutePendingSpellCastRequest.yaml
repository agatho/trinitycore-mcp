  class: Player
  method: CanExecutePendingSpellCastRequest
  signature: bool Player::CanExecutePendingSpellCastRequest()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can execute a pending spell cast request.
  description: The CanExecutePendingSpellCastRequest method checks if the player is
    currently in a state where they can proceed with executing a previously requested
    spell cast. This includes verifying that the player has not been interrupted,
    is not in an invalid state such as being dead or stunned, and that the spell cast
    request is still valid. The method is typically used internally by the game engine
    to ensure proper spell casting flow and prevent invalid actions during combat
    or other gameplay states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can execute the pending spell cast request,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the player is in an
    interrupted state, is dead, is stunned, or that the spell cast request has expired
    or become invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell cast eligibility
    code: "if (player->CanExecutePendingSpellCastRequest()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ executing the spell\n    player->ExecutePendingSpellCast();\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle invalid state\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0, SPELL_FAILED_INTERRUPTED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within TrinityCore's internal spell casting
    system and should not typically be called directly by addon developers. It performs
    several checks including player state validation, interrupt status, and spell
    cast request validity.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for custom spell logic as it's designed for
    internal engine use. Calling this method outside of the intended context may lead
    to unexpected behavior or game state corruption.
