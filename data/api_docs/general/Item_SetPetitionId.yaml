api:
  class: Item
  method: SetPetitionId
  signature: void Item::SetPetitionId(uint32 petitionId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the petition ID for the item, typically used for binding items to specific
    petition forms.
  description: This method assigns a unique petition identifier to an item, allowing
    it to be associated with a specific petition form or template. The method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's auction house system and item binding mechanics where
    items need to be linked to specific petition templates. It typically affects the
    item's properties and can influence how the item behaves when used or sold within
    the game context. This method is part of the general item management functionality
    and should be used carefully as it may impact item quality and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: petitionId
    description: The unique identifier for the petition form that the item will be
      bound to. This value typically corresponds to a specific petition template or
      form in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a petition ID on an item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetPetitionId(12345);

      // Item now has a petition ID of 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used in conjunction with other item binding methods
    to ensure proper item functionality. The method may not be available for all item
    types and depends on the item's type and properties.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the item is properly initialized
    and should not be used on items that are already bound or have been sold. Improper
    use can lead to item corruption or invalid behavior.
