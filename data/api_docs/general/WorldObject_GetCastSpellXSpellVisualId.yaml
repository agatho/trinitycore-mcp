  class: WorldObject
  method: GetCastSpellXSpellVisualId
  signature: uint32 WorldObject::GetCastSpellXSpellVisualId(const SpellInfo * spellInfo)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell visual ID associated with a cast spell for the WorldObject.
  description: This method returns the SpellVisualId from the SpellInfo structure
    that corresponds to the cast spell being executed by the WorldObject. It is used
    primarily in determining which visual effect should be displayed when a spell
    is cast, particularly in relation to the spell's visual representation and animation.
    The method is essential for proper spell handling within the TrinityCore framework,
    especially when dealing with visual effects and animations related to spell casting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the SpellVisualId associated with the cast spell, which represents
    the visual effect identifier used in the game's spell visual system. This value
    can be zero if no specific visual is defined for the spell or if the spell does
    not have a visual associated with it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 visualId = object->GetCastSpellXSpellVisualId(spellInfo);\nif (visualId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Handle the visual ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting logic and
    may require access to the SpellInfo structure. The returned value should be used
    carefully as it directly affects how spells are visually represented in-game.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as incorrect handling of visual IDs
    can lead to missing or incorrect visual effects during spell casting. Ensure that
    the spellInfo parameter is valid and properly initialized before calling this
    method.
