  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetTimeSince
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::GetTimeSince(int timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the elapsed time in milliseconds since a given timestamp.
  description: The GetTimeSince method computes the difference between the current
    game time and a provided timestamp, returning the result in milliseconds. This
    utility is commonly used in AI behavior systems to track timing intervals for
    decision-making processes, such as determining when a follower should re-evaluate
    its position relative to the leader or when to perform specific actions based
    on time thresholds. The method relies on the TrinityCore's internal game timer
    system to ensure accurate time measurements across different server environments.
  parameters:
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp in milliseconds representing a point in time from
      which to calculate the elapsed duration. This value should typically be obtained
      using methods like GetMSTime() or similar time retrieval functions available
      in the TrinityCore API.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of milliseconds that have
    passed since the specified timestamp. A negative value indicates that the provided
    timestamp is in the future relative to the current game time, while a zero or
    positive value represents the actual elapsed time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to measure elapsed time
    code: "int startTime = GetMSTime();\n// ... some logic here ...\nint elapsedTime\
      \ = leaderFollowBehavior->GetTimeSince(startTime);\nif (elapsedTime > 5000)\
      \ {\n    // Perform action after 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetTimeSince for AI decision making
    code: "class LeaderFollowBehavior {\npublic:\n    int lastUpdate;\n    \n    void\
      \ Update() {\n        int currentTime = GetMSTime();\n        int timeElapsed\
      \ = GetTimeSince(lastUpdate);\n        \n        if (timeElapsed > 1000) { //\
      \ 1 second\n            // Re-evaluate follower position\n            ReevaluatePosition();\n\
      \            lastUpdate = currentTime;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the timestamp parameter is in milliseconds and uses
    the same time base as TrinityCore's internal timer functions. It is recommended
    to use GetMSTime() or similar methods to obtain accurate timestamps for comparison.
  warnings: Ensure that the timestamp passed to this method is valid and represents
    a meaningful point in time. Passing an invalid or corrupted timestamp may lead
    to incorrect elapsed time calculations, potentially causing unexpected behavior
    in AI logic.
