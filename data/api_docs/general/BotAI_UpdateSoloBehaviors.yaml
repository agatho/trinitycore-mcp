  class: BotAI
  method: UpdateSoloBehaviors
  signature: void BotAI::UpdateSoloBehaviors(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the solo behavior logic for bot characters in the game world.
  description: The UpdateSoloBehaviors method is responsible for managing and executing
    the artificial intelligence behaviors of individual bot characters when they are
    not part of a group. This method processes various AI states such as movement,
    combat, and interaction with environment objects. It typically runs on a regular
    interval determined by the game loop's delta time (diff parameter), ensuring that
    bots maintain appropriate behavior patterns even when alone. The implementation
    likely includes checks for player proximity, threat detection, quest objectives,
    and other solo-specific AI triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update cycle. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed between AI updates and affects
      behavior timing and cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& bot : sBotAI->GetAllBots())\n\
      \    {\n        if (bot && bot->IsInWorld())\n        {\n            bot->UpdateSoloBehaviors(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game loop or AI update
    system. It's important to note that this method only handles solo behaviors; group-based
    behaviors are managed separately through other methods. The diff parameter should
    be passed accurately to ensure proper timing of AI actions.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff value can cause erratic behavior in bot
    AI, such as actions happening too frequently or not at all. This method must not
    be called on bots that are not properly initialized or are in invalid states.
