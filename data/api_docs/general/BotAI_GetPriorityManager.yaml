  class: BotAI
  method: GetPriorityManager
  signature: const BehaviorPriorityManager * BotAI::GetPriorityManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the behavior priority manager associated with this bot
    AI instance.
  description: The GetPriorityManager method provides access to the BehaviorPriorityManager
    object that controls the priority-based decision-making logic for the bot's AI
    behaviors. This manager is responsible for determining which actions should take
    precedence over others based on defined priorities, ensuring that the bot makes
    logical and efficient decisions in various game scenarios. The returned pointer
    is constant, indicating that the method does not modify the priority manager but
    provides read-only access to it. This method is typically used internally by the
    AI system or by external components that need to query or inspect the current
    priority configuration of the bot's behavior system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the BehaviorPriorityManager object associated with
    this BotAI instance. Returns nullptr if no priority manager has been initialized
    for the bot AI, or if the bot AI is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Priority Manager for Inspection
    code: "const BehaviorPriorityManager* priorityMgr = botAI->GetPriorityManager();\n\
      if (priorityMgr != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use priorityMgr to inspect or query behavior\
      \ priorities\n    uint32_t numPriorities = priorityMgr->GetNumPriorities();\n\
      \    // Process priorities...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BehaviorPriorityManager pointer is valid only as long as the
    BotAI instance remains alive and properly initialized. Accessing the manager after
    the bot AI has been destroyed or invalidated may result in undefined behavior.
    This method does not perform any locking or synchronization, so it should be called
    from threads where thread safety is guaranteed.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the BehaviorPriorityManager through the returned
    pointer, as it is marked as const. Modifying the manager directly could lead to
    inconsistent AI behavior and system instability. Always ensure that the BotAI
    instance is in a valid state before calling this method.
