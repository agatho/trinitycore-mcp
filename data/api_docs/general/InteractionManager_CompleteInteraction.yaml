api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: CompleteInteraction
  signature: void InteractionManager::CompleteInteraction(Player * bot, InteractionResult
    result)
documentation:
  brief: Completes an interaction process for a player bot with the specified result.
  description: The CompleteInteraction method finalizes an ongoing interaction within
    the TrinityCore framework, typically used by AI bots to signal the end of an interaction
    sequence. It takes a Player pointer and an InteractionResult enum value to determine
    how the interaction should be concluded. This method is crucial for managing bot
    behavior during quest interactions, vendor transactions, or any other interactive
    events in the game world. The method ensures proper cleanup and state transitions
    for the interacting player and may trigger subsequent actions based on the provided
    result.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is completing
      the interaction. Must not be null.
  - name: result
    description: The InteractionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the interaction.
      This determines how the interaction is finalized and what actions follow.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Completion
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player object

      InteractionResult result = INTERACTION_SUCCESS;

      interactionManager->CompleteInteraction(myBot, result);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Completing Interaction with Failure Result
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Bot player object

      InteractionResult result = INTERACTION_FAILURE;

      interactionManager->CompleteInteraction(bot, result);

      // This might trigger error handling or retry logic in the bot AI'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the interaction system and
    should not be invoked directly unless implementing custom interaction logic. The
    method may perform cleanup operations such as releasing interaction locks, updating
    player state, or triggering follow-up actions based on the result.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. Passing an invalid InteractionResult value may lead to unexpected
    interaction termination or system errors.
