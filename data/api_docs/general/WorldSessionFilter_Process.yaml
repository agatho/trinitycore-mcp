  class: WorldSessionFilter
  method: Process
  signature: bool WorldSessionFilter::Process(WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a WorldPacket through the session filter to determine if it should
    be handled or dropped.
  description: The Process method evaluates incoming WorldPackets within the context
    of a WorldSession, applying various filtering rules and checks to decide whether
    the packet should be allowed through for further processing. This method is crucial
    for maintaining network integrity and security by preventing malformed or unauthorized
    packets from being processed by the game logic. It typically performs validation
    on packet headers, checks for valid session states, and may enforce rate limiting
    or other protocol compliance measures before allowing a packet to proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the packet was successfully processed and should continue
    through the system; returns false if the packet failed validation checks and should
    be dropped or discarded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet filtering
    code: "if (sessionFilter->Process(&incomingPacket)) {\n    // Packet passed filter,\
      \ proceed with normal handling\n    HandlePacket(incomingPacket);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Packet failed filter, discard it\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_PACKETS,\
      \ \"Dropped invalid packet from session %u\", session->GetAccountId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the packet reception phase of the
    WorldSession lifecycle. It's important to note that modifying the packet data
    within this method can have unintended consequences, as it may affect subsequent
    processing steps. The method should not be used for heavy computational tasks
    due to its frequent invocation during active gameplay.
  warnings: Do not assume that a returned true value guarantees the packet is completely
    safe or valid - additional validation may still be required in downstream handlers.
    Avoid performing blocking operations within this method as it can cause network
    lag and affect overall server performance.
