  brief: Handles bot AI logic when a bot respawns in the game world
  description: The OnRespawn method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when a
    bot character completes its respawn cycle after death. This method typically resets
    the bot's state, reinitializes its AI behavior, and ensures proper positioning
    within the game world. It serves as a critical hook for maintaining consistent
    bot behavior across respawn events and may be used to restore health, mana, reset
    combat states, or reassign objectives. The method is automatically called by the
    core system during the respawn process and does not require manual invocation.

  - title: Basic usage in custom bot AI implementation
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void OnRespawn() override\
      \ {\n        // Reset bot's health and mana\n        if (GetBot()->GetHealth()\
      \ < GetBot()->GetMaxHealth()) {\n            GetBot()->SetHealth(GetBot()->GetMaxHealth());\n\
      \        }\n        if (GetBot()->GetPower(POWER_MANA) < GetBot()->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA))\
      \ {\n            GetBot()->SetPower(POWER_MANA, GetBot()->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA));\n\
      \        }\n        // Reinitialize AI behavior\n        BotAI::OnRespawn();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal bot AI lifecycle management and should
    not be called directly unless implementing a custom respawn handler. It is typically
    overridden in derived classes to add specific behavior upon respawn, such as resetting
    quest states or reassigning patrol routes.
