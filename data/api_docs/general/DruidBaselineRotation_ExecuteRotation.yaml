  class: DruidBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool DruidBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline Druid rotation logic for a bot, returning true if the
    rotation was successfully processed.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a Druid bot's combat behavior. It evaluates the current state of the bot and
    target, selects appropriate spells or abilities based on baseline rotation rules,
    and executes them. The method interacts with the BaselineRotationManager to manage
    rotation state and timing. This function is typically called during combat situations
    where the Druid needs to perform automated spell casting according to predefined
    rotation priorities. The method returns true if the rotation was successfully
    executed, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current state
      information such as health, mana, and available abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's player data structure containing target state
      information including health, position, and status effects.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that handles rotation state
      tracking, timing, and coordination between different rotation components.
  returns: Returns true if the rotation was successfully executed with valid actions
    taken; returns false if no valid action could be determined or execution failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rotation Execution
    code: "DruidBaselineRotation rotation;\nint botData[10];\nint targetData[10];\n\
      BaselineRotationManager manager;\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Rotation executed successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void DruidCombatAI::Update() {\n    if (IsInCombat()) {\n        int bot[20];\n\
      \        int target[20];\n        // Fill bot and target data\n        if (!druidRotation.ExecuteRotation(bot,\
      \ target, rotationManager)) {\n            // Handle rotation failure\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager must be correctly configured
    with appropriate timing and state information. Performance is optimized for frequent
    calls during combat, so avoid heavy computations within this method.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations without proper validation,
    as it may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot and target pointers are
    valid before calling to prevent memory access violations.
