documentation:
  brief: Recalculates the delay moment for destination target during spell casting.
  description: This method adjusts the timing of spell execution based on the target's
    position and movement, ensuring accurate spell delivery. It typically occurs when
    a spell is being cast and the target's location changes during the casting process.
    The method recalculates the delay moment to account for potential movement of
    the target or caster, which can affect the spell's timing and effectiveness. This
    is particularly important in combat scenarios where targets may move during spell
    casting, ensuring that spells hit their intended targets at the correct time.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->RecalculateDelayMomentForDst();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during active spell casting when target movement
    occurs. Implementation details may vary based on the specific spell type and game
    mechanics involved. Performance considerations include potential overhead from
    recalculating timing for each movement update.
