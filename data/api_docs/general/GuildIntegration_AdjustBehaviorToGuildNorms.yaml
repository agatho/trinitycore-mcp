documentation:
  brief: Adjusts a player's behavior to align with guild norms and expectations.
  description: The AdjustBehaviorToGuildNorms method modifies a player's actions or
    attributes to ensure compliance with established guild standards and social norms.
    This function likely enforces guild-specific rules, such as participation requirements,
    role-based responsibilities, or behavioral expectations within the guild context.
    The method operates on a provided player reference and adjusts their behavior
    accordingly without returning any value. It is typically invoked during guild
    events, membership updates, or when enforcing guild policies.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or state.
      The method modifies this value to reflect adjusted behavior according to guild
      norms.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AdjustBehaviorToGuildNorms(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild management systems and may
    affect player reputation, permissions, or access to guild features. It is recommended
    to call this function only when necessary to avoid unnecessary processing overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and initialized
    to prevent undefined behavior or memory corruption. This method modifies the input
    parameter directly, so callers should be aware of potential side effects.
