  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransGUID
  signature: ObjectGuid WorldObject::GetTransGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport GUID associated with this WorldObject, if it is mounted
    on a transport.
  description: The GetTransGUID method retrieves the ObjectGuid of the transport vehicle
    that the WorldObject is currently mounted on. This is used primarily for objects
    that are part of a transport system, such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving
    transports in Azeroth. The method returns an empty ObjectGuid if the object is
    not currently on any transport. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    correct positioning and movement logic when objects are transported across maps.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the ObjectGuid of the transport vehicle that this WorldObject is
    currently mounted on, or an empty ObjectGuid if it is not on a transport.
  examples:
  - title: Check if object is on a transport
    code: "if (!player->GetTransGUID().IsEmpty()) {\n    // Player is on a transport\n\
      \    ObjectGuid transportGuid = player->GetTransGUID();\n    // Use transportGuid\
      \ for further logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Get transport information for a creature
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nObjectGuid transGuid = creature->GetTransGUID();\n\
      if (!transGuid.IsEmpty()) {\n    Transport* transport = sObjectMgr->GetTransportById(transGuid.GetEntry());\n\
      \    if (transport) {\n        // Process transport-related logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement and positioning
    updates. The returned GUID can be used to query the transport system for position
    data or to synchronize object movement with the transport's motion.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method on objects that may not have a transport
    set, as it will return an empty ObjectGuid. Always check if the returned GUID
    is valid before attempting to use it in operations.
