documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell area data from the database into memory for spell
    targeting and area effect validation.
  description: The LoadSpellAreas method is responsible for loading spell area restrictions
    and associated data from the database tables into internal memory structures.
    This method processes entries that define where spells can be cast, such as specific
    zones, areas, or maps where a spell is valid. It typically runs during server
    startup or database reload operations to ensure that spell targeting logic has
    access to up-to-date area restriction information. The method iterates through
    the spell area records and populates internal lookup tables used by the spell
    system when validating whether a spell can be cast in a given location.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellAreas();\n\
      \    // Spell areas are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reloads.
    It's important to note that spell area data must be properly indexed in the database
    for this method to function correctly. The method may perform significant database
    queries and memory allocations, so it should not be called frequently during runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal data structures. Ensure that the
    underlying database tables (like `spell_area`) contain valid and consistent data
    before calling this method.
