  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetDistance
  signature: float CombatSpecializationBase::GetDistance(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the melee combat distance to the specified target
    unit.
  description: The GetDistance method computes the actual distance between the calling
    CombatSpecializationBase instance (typically a player or creature) and the provided
    target Unit. This calculation takes into account the combat reach and bounding
    radius of both entities, ensuring accurate melee range determination for combat
    mechanics. The returned value represents the distance in yards, which can be used
    to determine if a target is within melee striking range. This method is essential
    for AI decision-making in combat scenarios where proximity determines attack eligibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated distance in yards between the
    calling unit and the target. Returns 0.0f if either the calling unit or target
    is invalid, or if they are in the same location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check melee range
    code: "if (player->GetDistance(target) <= player->GetMeleeReach()) {\n    // Target\
      \ is within melee range\n    player->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance for combat decision making
    code: "float distance = combatSpecialization->GetDistance(enemy);\nif (distance\
      \ > 5.0f) {\n    // Move closer or use ranged attack\n    combatSpecialization->MoveToTarget(enemy);\n\
      } else if (distance <= 2.5f) {\n    // Within optimal melee range, begin attacking\n\
      \    combatSpecialization->Attack(enemy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses the Unit's GetDistance() function with proper
    combat reach adjustments. It accounts for object bounding radii and combat reach
    values to provide accurate melee distance calculations. The method is optimized
    for performance in combat situations and should be used instead of direct coordinate-based
    distance calculations.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate results if either the calling unit or
    target has invalid positioning data. Always verify that both units are valid before
    calling this method, as it does not perform null checks on internal pointers.
