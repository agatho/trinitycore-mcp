documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the player's guild
  description: This method retrieves the name of the guild that the player currently
    belongs to. It is a fundamental getter method that provides access to the guild
    information within the player's character data. The method returns an empty string
    if the player is not in a guild, making it useful for checking guild membership
    status. This functionality is essential for various game mechanics including guild
    management, communication, and player interaction systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the guild name. If the player is not in
    a guild, an empty string is returned. The string may be empty or contain the actual
    guild name depending on whether the player has joined a guild.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "std::string guildName = player->GetGuildName();\nif (!guildName.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Player is in guild: \" << guildName << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Player is not in any guild\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It does
    not require any special conditions or preconditions to execute. Performance-wise,
    this method is lightweight as it simply accesses stored data without complex computations.
  warnings: This method should not be used for checking guild membership status in
    isolation, as it only returns the name string and not whether the player actually
    belongs to a guild. Consider using additional methods like GetGuildId() or IsInGuild()
    for more comprehensive guild information.
