documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover items and gold from a failed auction transaction.
  description: The RecoverFromAuctionFailure method is responsible for handling the
    cleanup and recovery of auction items and gold when an auction fails. This typically
    occurs when an auction does not complete successfully due to various reasons such
    as timeout, cancellation, or system errors. The method processes the auction data
    associated with the provided session ID to ensure that any items that were being
    auctioned are returned to their original owners and any gold that was placed as
    bid is refunded. It serves as a critical recovery mechanism within the auction
    house system to maintain game economy integrity and player trust.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction session for which recovery is
      being attempted. This ID typically corresponds to an active or recently failed
      auction transaction in the auction house system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recover items from a failed auction
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      ah->RecoverFromAuctionFailure(sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction data structures and may
    involve database operations to update player inventories and gold balances. It
    should be called only when an auction is confirmed to have failed, as calling
    it on successful auctions could result in unintended item loss or refund behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid session IDs can lead to data
    inconsistency or corruption in the auction house system. Always validate that
    the auction has actually failed before invoking this recovery mechanism.
