  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: CalculateEfficiency
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::CalculateEfficiency(const BotLearningData *
    data) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the learning efficiency rating of a bot based on its
    training data.
  description: The CalculateEfficiency method computes a normalized efficiency score
    for a bot's learning performance by analyzing its training data. This score represents
    how effectively the bot has learned and retained skills or behaviors over time.
    The calculation typically considers factors such as skill progression rate, accuracy
    of learned actions, and consistency of performance improvements. The method is
    designed to provide insights into bot learning effectiveness within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly useful for AI optimization and performance monitoring.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the bot's learning efficiency rating, typically
    ranging from 0.0 (inefficient) to 1.0 (optimal). Values may exceed 1.0 in exceptional
    cases where performance surpasses expected benchmarks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      BotLearningData data;

      // Assume data is populated with bot training information

      float efficiency = analytics.CalculateEfficiency(&data);

      std::cout << "Bot efficiency: " << efficiency << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs statistical analysis on the provided BotLearningData
    structure, potentially involving weighted averages or machine learning algorithms
    to determine efficiency. The implementation may cache results for performance
    optimization when called repeatedly with the same data.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input data; passing null or improperly initialized
    BotLearningData structures may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    Ensure that the data is properly populated before calling this method.
