  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: RegisterCleaveMechanic
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::RegisterCleaveMechanic(Unit * source, const CleaveMechanic
    & cleave)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a cleave mechanic for a specified unit, enabling the system to
    track and apply cleave-related game mechanics.
  description: The RegisterCleaveMechanic method is used to register a CleaveMechanic
    structure with a specific Unit in the TrinityCore framework. This allows the game's
    AI and combat system to recognize and properly handle cleave-based abilities or
    effects that target multiple enemies. The method stores the provided cleave data
    associated with the source unit, which can then be referenced during combat calculations
    or triggered events. It is typically invoked when a creature or player gains a
    new cleave mechanic, such as when acquiring a new ability or buff that enables
    cleaving attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that owns or initiates the cleave mechanic.
      This unit will be tracked for cleave-related behaviors and effects.
  - name: cleave
    description: A const reference to a CleaveMechanic structure containing the details
      of the cleave effect, including target requirements, damage calculations, and
      other relevant parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* boss = ...; // Get reference to a boss unit

      CleaveMechanic cleave;

      cleave.damageMultiplier = 1.5f;

      cleave.maxTargets = 3;

      mechanicAwareness->RegisterCleaveMechanic(boss, cleave);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Cleave Data
    code: 'Unit* player = ...; // Player unit

      CleaveMechanic cleave;

      cleave.damageMultiplier = 2.0f;

      cleave.maxTargets = 5;

      cleave.targetType = TARGET_TYPE_ENEMY;

      mechanicAwareness->RegisterCleaveMechanic(player, cleave);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Unit pointer is valid and not null. The CleaveMechanic
    object must be properly initialized before being passed to this function. Internally,
    this method likely stores the mechanic in a container or map indexed by the source
    unit for quick lookup during combat events.
  warnings: Ensure that the source Unit is fully initialized and alive when calling
    this method, as passing an invalid or destroyed unit pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, avoid registering duplicate cleave mechanics without proper cleanup,
    which could cause unexpected interactions in combat.
