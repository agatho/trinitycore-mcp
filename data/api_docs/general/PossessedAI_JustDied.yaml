documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a possessed creature dies, performing cleanup and
    AI-related actions.
  description: The JustDied method in the PossessedAI class is invoked when a creature
    that is under possession (controlled by an AI) dies. This method typically handles
    necessary cleanup operations such as releasing the possessed unit from control,
    notifying the controlling player or system, and potentially triggering additional
    events or logic related to the death of the possessed entity. It ensures proper
    state management for possessed creatures within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyPossessedAI : public PossessedAI {\npublic:\n    void JustDied(int*\
      \ param0) override {\n        // Custom logic when possessed creature dies\n\
      \        PossessedAI::JustDied(param0);\n        // Additional cleanup or event\
      \ handling\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system for creatures that are possessed by
    players or other entities. It's important to call the base class implementation
    if overriding to maintain proper AI behavior and state transitions.
  warnings: When overriding this method, ensure that any custom logic does not interfere
    with the core functionality of releasing possession or managing the creature's
    death state. Improper handling may lead to dangling references or incorrect AI
    behavior.
