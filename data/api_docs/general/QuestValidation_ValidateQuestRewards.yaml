api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestRewards
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestRewards(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the rewards for a specified quest and player, ensuring they meet
    game requirements.
  description: The ValidateQuestRewards method checks whether the rewards associated
    with a given quest are valid for a specific player. This validation includes checking
    if the player meets prerequisites such as level requirements, required items,
    and other conditions necessary to claim the quest rewards. The method is typically
    used in quest completion logic to ensure that players can only receive rewards
    they are eligible for based on their current game state and progress. It returns
    true if all reward validations pass, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose rewards need to be validated.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player for whom the
      quest rewards are being validated.
  returns: Returns true if all reward validations for the specified quest pass for
    the given player; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ValidateQuestRewards
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->ValidateQuestRewards(12345, player)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with reward distribution\n    player->AddQuestReward(12345);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle invalid rewards\n    player->SendNotification(\"Invalid quest\
      \ rewards.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database lookups and checks against the player's
    inventory, quest log, and other game state elements. It is recommended to call
    this method before awarding any quest rewards to prevent exploitation or incorrect
    reward distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId corresponds to a valid quest in the database;
    otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or cause errors. Also, be
    cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections of code due to
    potential database queries and validation logic.
