  method: InventoryManager
  signature: void InventoryManager::InventoryManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the inventory manager for a player bot, setting up internal data
    structures and references.
  description: The InventoryManager constructor initializes the inventory management
    system for a specified player bot. This method sets up necessary internal references
    to the player object, configures inventory-related data structures, and prepares
    the system for managing the bot's items, bags, and equipment. The initialization
    process ensures that all subsequent inventory operations can be performed correctly
    by establishing proper connections between the inventory manager and the player's
    inventory state. This constructor is typically called during the creation or setup
    phase of a bot character within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose inventory
      will be managed. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inventory Manager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      InventoryManager inventoryMgr(myBot);

      // The inventory manager is now initialized and ready to manage the bot''s inventory'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate inventory operations or loading
    of item data. It merely establishes the necessary references and prepares the
    internal state for future inventory management tasks. The actual inventory data
    loading may occur later during gameplay or when specific inventory operations
    are requested.
