documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation reward rate data for a specified faction ID
  description: The GetRepRewardRate method fetches the reputation reward rate configuration
    for a given faction ID from the object manager's internal data structures. This
    function is used to determine how reputation gains are modified for specific factions,
    typically in the context of quest rewards or other game mechanics that scale reputation
    gains based on faction standing. The returned pointer points to a constant RepRewardRate
    structure which contains multipliers and modifiers affecting reputation rewards
    for that particular faction. If no matching faction ID is found, the method returns
    a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a RepRewardRate structure containing the reputation
    reward rate configuration for the specified faction, or nullptr if no such faction
    exists in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve reputation reward rate for a faction
    code: "const RepRewardRate* rate = sObjectMgr->GetRepRewardRate(1234);\nif (rate\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use rate->questRate, rate->creatureRate, etc.\n   \
      \ printf(\"Quest rate: %f\\n\", rate->questRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are typically loaded during
    server startup from database tables. The returned RepRewardRate structure is immutable
    and should not be modified directly. Performance is optimized through internal
    caching mechanisms.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the returned
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. The faction ID must correspond to an existing
    faction in the game database, otherwise the method will return nullptr.
