  class: SoulShardSystem
  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 SoulShardSystem::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of soul shards available in the player's inventory.
  description: The GetAvailable method returns the count of soul shards that are currently
    available for use by the player. In World of Warcraft's context, soul shards are
    a resource used primarily by warlocks to cast certain spells and abilities. This
    method provides access to the player's current soul shard inventory without modifying
    it. The returned value represents the total number of soul shards that can be
    consumed in the next spell or ability activation, assuming no other systems are
    affecting the shard count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of soul shards currently available
    to the player. This value is typically between 0 and 5, as players can accumulate
    up to 5 soul shards before reaching the maximum capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 shards = player->GetSoulShardSystem()->GetAvailable();\nif (shards\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player has available soul shards\n    // Proceed with spell\
      \ casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Availability Before Casting
    code: "SoulShardSystem* shardSystem = player->GetSoulShardSystem();\nuint32 available\
      \ = shardSystem->GetAvailable();\nif (available >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast a spell\
      \ that requires 3 soul shards\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CONSUME_SHARDS,\
      \ true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough shards, handle accordingly\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough soul shards available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any side effects or modify the shard count.
    It simply reads and returns the current value. The soul shard system in TrinityCore
    typically updates through events such as spell casting, item usage, or periodic
    regeneration. This method should be used when checking resource availability before
    performing actions that consume soul shards.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value may change between the time you call
    this method and when you use it, especially if other systems (like spell effects
    or item usage) are modifying the shard count concurrently. For critical operations
    where shard count must remain constant, consider locking or caching the value.
