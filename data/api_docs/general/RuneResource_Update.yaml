  class: RuneResource
  method: Update
  signature: void RuneResource::Update(uint32 diff, bool inCombat, float hasteModifier)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the rune resource state based on elapsed time, combat status, and
    haste modifier.
  description: The Update method manages the internal state of a RuneResource object
    by processing the passage of time, adjusting for combat status, and applying haste
    modifiers to determine when runes regenerate. This method is typically called
    during game loop updates to maintain accurate rune resource tracking for player
    characters. It ensures that runes are properly replenished according to game mechanics,
    taking into account whether the player is in combat and how haste affects regeneration
    speed.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has passed for rune regeneration calculations.
  - name: inCombat
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player is currently in combat.
      Rune regeneration rates may differ based on combat status, with some runes regenerating
      slower or faster depending on this state.
  - name: hasteModifier
    description: A floating-point value representing the haste modifier that affects
      rune regeneration speed. Values greater than 1.0 increase regeneration speed,
      while values less than 1.0 decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second

      bool inCombat = false;

      float hasteModifier = 1.0f;

      runeResource.Update(diff, inCombat, hasteModifier);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Haste Modifier
    code: 'uint32 diff = 500; // 0.5 seconds

      bool inCombat = true;

      float hasteModifier = 1.2f; // 20% haste bonus

      runeResource.Update(diff, inCombat, hasteModifier);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure accurate
    rune resource tracking. The implementation likely involves internal timers and
    state management for each rune type within the resource pool.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect time differences or invalid haste modifiers
    may cause unexpected behavior in rune regeneration timing. Ensure that diff values
    are positive and hasteModifier is greater than zero.
