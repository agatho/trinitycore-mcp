  method: HandlePositioning
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandlePositioning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if the hunter should reposition based on target distance and combat
    state
  description: The HandlePositioning method evaluates whether the hunter AI should
    adjust its positioning relative to the current target. It checks the distance
    between the hunter and target, considering combat state, weapon range, and positioning
    requirements for optimal damage output. The method returns true if repositioning
    is needed, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    ranged combat positioning in the HunterAI system.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index. Used
      to determine positioning requirements based on target distance and combat state.
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should reposition to optimize combat effectiveness,
    false if current positioning is acceptable or if positioning is not required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic positioning check
    code: "int targetId = 42;\nbool needsRepositioning = hunterAI->HandlePositioning(&targetId);\n\
      if (needsRepositioning) {\n    // Execute repositioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to maintain optimal
    positioning. The decision-making process considers both melee and ranged weapon
    requirements, as well as the hunter's current combat stance.
  warnings: The target parameter must be a valid pointer to an integer representing
    a valid target ID; otherwise, behavior is undefined. This method should not be
    called outside of AI update contexts.
