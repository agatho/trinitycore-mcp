documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff effects on the enhancement shaman character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buff effects that are currently affecting the enhancement shaman. This
    includes buffs from items, talents, spells, and other game mechanics that provide
    stat enhancements or special abilities. The method typically iterates through
    the shaman's active buff list, checks their duration and effectiveness, and applies
    any necessary updates to the character's stats or abilities. It ensures that the
    shaman maintains proper buff states during gameplay, particularly important for
    maintaining optimal performance in combat situations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EnhancementShamanRefactored* shaman = ...;

      shaman->UpdateBuffs();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    EnhancementShamanRefactored* shaman = GetPlayerShaman();\n\
      \    if (shaman)\n    {\n        shaman->UpdateBuffs();\n        // Continue\
      \ with combat logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the game's update cycle or when buff
    states need to be refreshed. It may trigger additional internal updates such as
    stat recalculations or visual effect updates. The implementation likely involves
    checking for expired buffs and applying new ones based on current talent levels,
    equipment, and spell effects.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal game update cycle may cause
    unexpected behavior or performance issues. Ensure that buff states are properly
    synchronized with the game's timing system to avoid inconsistencies in character
    abilities or stats.
