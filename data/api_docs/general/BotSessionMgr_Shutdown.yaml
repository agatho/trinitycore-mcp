  brief: Shuts down all active bot sessions managed by the BotSessionMgr instance
  description: The Shutdown method terminates and cleans up all currently active bot
    sessions within the BotSessionMgr. This method ensures proper cleanup of resources
    associated with each bot session, including releasing memory, closing connections,
    and notifying relevant systems about the session termination. It is typically
    called during server shutdown or when deactivating bot functionality to prevent
    resource leaks and ensure clean system state. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSessionMgr* sessionMgr = BotSessionMgr::Instance();

      sessionMgr->Shutdown();'

  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the bot sessions to avoid race conditions. It is recommended to call this method
    before destroying the BotSessionMgr instance to ensure proper cleanup of all managed
    resources.
