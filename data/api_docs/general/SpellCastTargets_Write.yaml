documentation:
  brief: Writes spell cast target data to a packet structure for network transmission.
  description: The Write method serializes the spell cast targets information into
    a WorldPackets::Spells::SpellTargetData packet structure. This method is typically
    used when sending spell cast information over the network to clients, ensuring
    that all relevant targeting data such as unit targets, item targets, and destination
    coordinates are properly encoded and transmitted. The method operates on the internal
    state of the SpellCastTargets object and prepares it for network serialization
    without modifying the original target data. It's an integral part of the spell
    casting system in TrinityCore, facilitating communication between server and client
    regarding spell targeting mechanics.

    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.setUnitTarget(targetUnit);

      WorldPackets::Spells::SpellTargetData data;

      targets.Write(data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SpellCastTargets object has been properly initialized
    with valid target data before calling. The method does not perform any validation
    of the internal state and relies on the caller to ensure data integrity. It's
    commonly used in conjunction with spell packet construction for network synchronization.
