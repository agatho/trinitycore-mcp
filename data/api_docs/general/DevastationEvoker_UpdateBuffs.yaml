  brief: Updates the buff states and application logic for the Devastation Evoker
    AI.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the application, removal, and state
    updates of buffs specific to the DevastationEvoker class. This method is typically
    called during the AI update cycle to ensure that the evoker maintains appropriate
    buff statuses based on combat conditions, spell cooldowns, and target states.
    It handles both internal buff tracking and communicates with the core game engine
    to apply or remove visual and functional effects associated with these buffs.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DevastationEvoker::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be invoked regularly as part of the creature's
    AI update cycle. It may internally check for buff expiration, reapplication conditions,
    and target validity before modifying any buff states.
