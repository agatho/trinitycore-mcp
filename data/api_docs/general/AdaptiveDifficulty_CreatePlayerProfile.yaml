documentation:
  brief: Creates a player profile for adaptive difficulty calculations
  description: The CreatePlayerProfile method initializes and stores player-specific
    data required for adaptive difficulty adjustments in World of Warcraft. This method
    is typically invoked when a player character is created or loaded into the game
    world, ensuring that the adaptive difficulty system has access to necessary player
    statistics such as level, gear score, and progression data. The profile contains
    information used by the adaptive difficulty system to dynamically adjust encounter
    difficulty based on player capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::CreatePlayerProfile(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the player object is fully initialized
    and contains valid character data. The profile creation process may involve database
    operations that could impact performance during high-concurrency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized player profile may result
    in data overwrites or inconsistencies. Ensure proper synchronization when multiple
    threads access player data simultaneously.
