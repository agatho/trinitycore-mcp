  class: ObjectMgr
  method: AddLocaleString
  signature: void ObjectMgr::AddLocaleString(std::string_view value, LocaleConstant
    localeConstant, int & data)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a localized string value to the provided data reference based on the
    specified locale constant.
  description: The AddLocaleString method is used within the ObjectMgr class to store
    or update a localized string value in a data structure, typically for handling
    multilingual game content. It takes a string view representing the value to be
    stored, a LocaleConstant indicating the language or region, and an integer reference
    that likely serves as a storage index or identifier for the locale-specific data.
    This method is crucial for supporting localization features in TrinityCore, allowing
    game objects, NPCs, items, and other entities to have different string representations
    depending on the player's locale settings. The method modifies the data parameter
    in-place, suggesting it may be used to build up a collection of localized strings
    or update an existing entry.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: A std::string_view containing the localized string value to be added
      or updated.
  - name: localeConstant
    description: A LocaleConstant enum value specifying the language or region for
      which the string is intended (e.g., LOCALE_en, LOCALE_fr).
  - name: data
    description: An integer reference that acts as a storage index or identifier where
      the localized string data will be stored or updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a localized greeting for English locale
    code: 'std::string_view greeting = "Hello, World!";

      LocaleConstant locale = LOCALE_en;

      int greetingId = 12345;

      ObjectMgr::AddLocaleString(greeting, locale, greetingId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the localization system in TrinityCore and is typically
    used internally by the core when loading database entries that support multiple
    languages. The 'data' parameter likely refers to an index within a larger array
    or map structure that holds locale-specific data for various game elements.
