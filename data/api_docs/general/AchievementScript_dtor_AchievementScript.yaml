documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AchievementScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AchievementScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the achievement script instance. This method is automatically invoked when
    an AchievementScript object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's achievement system, this ensures proper cleanup of script-related
    data structures and prevents memory leaks. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no special operations beyond standard object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    AchievementScript* script = new AchievementScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocated Script
    code: "void AnotherFunction() {\n    AchievementScript script; // Constructor\
      \ called\n    // ... use the script ...\n    // Destructor called automatically\
      \ when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived class objects. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless explicitly managing object lifetime through placement new or similar techniques.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. The destructor should only be called by the C++
    runtime during normal object destruction.
