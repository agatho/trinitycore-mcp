documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the internal store of calendar event invites
    managed by the CalendarMgr.
  description: The GetInvites method provides access to the internal data structure
    that holds all calendar event invitations within the TrinityCore system. This
    method returns a const reference to a CalendarEventInviteStore, which contains
    all invite records for calendar events. The returned reference allows read-only
    access to the collection of invites without modifying the underlying data. This
    is typically used by the game's calendar system to retrieve and display pending
    invitations for players. The method does not perform any operations on the data;
    it simply provides a view into the existing invite storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the CalendarEventInviteStore, which contains all
    calendar event invites currently stored in the system. This allows read-only access
    to the collection of calendar event invitations.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Calendar Invites
    code: "const CalendarEventInviteStore& invites = calendarMgr.GetInvites();\nfor\
      \ (const auto& invite : invites)\n{\n    // Process each calendar invite\n \
      \   uint64 inviteId = invite->GetId();\n    uint64 eventId = invite->GetEventId();\n\
      \    // ... handle invite data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal storage managed by CalendarMgr.
    Modifications to the invite store should be done through appropriate CalendarMgr
    methods rather than direct manipulation of the returned reference. This method
    is thread-safe as long as no other threads are modifying the invite store concurrently.
