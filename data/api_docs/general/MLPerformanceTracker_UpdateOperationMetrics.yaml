documentation:
  brief: Updates performance metrics for machine learning operations with provided
    sample data.
  description: The UpdateOperationMetrics method is responsible for processing and
    storing performance-related data from machine learning operation samples. This
    method typically collects timing information, resource usage statistics, and other
    operational metrics to help monitor and optimize the performance of ML systems
    within the TrinityCore environment. It accepts a const reference to an MLPerformanceSample
    object which contains the relevant metric data for updating internal tracking
    structures. The method is designed to be called periodically or after specific
    ML operations complete, enabling real-time performance monitoring and analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: sample
    description: A constant reference to an MLPerformanceSample object containing
      the performance metrics and data points to be processed and stored for tracking
      purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceSample sample;

      // Populate sample with performance data

      tracker.UpdateOperationMetrics(sample);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with ML Operation Tracking
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // Perform ML operation

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      MLPerformanceSample sample;

      sample.duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      sample.memory_usage = GetCurrentMemoryUsage();

      tracker.UpdateOperationMetrics(sample);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system and
    may internally use thread-safe data structures to handle concurrent updates. The
    MLPerformanceSample parameter should be properly initialized before being passed
    to ensure meaningful metrics are recorded.
  warnings: Ensure that the MLPerformanceSample object passed to this method contains
    valid data, as invalid or uninitialized values could lead to incorrect performance
    tracking results. This method may be called frequently during ML operations, so
    performance considerations should be taken into account for high-frequency usage
    scenarios.
