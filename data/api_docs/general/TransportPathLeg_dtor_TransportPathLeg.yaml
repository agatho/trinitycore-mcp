  class: TransportPathLeg
  method: ~TransportPathLeg
  signature: void TransportPathLeg::~TransportPathLeg()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TransportPathLeg object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~TransportPathLeg destructor is automatically invoked when a TransportPathLeg
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources associated with the transport
    path leg, such as waypoints or animation data. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, TransportPathLeg represents a segment of a transport's movement path,
    and this destructor guarantees that no memory leaks occur when these segments
    are discarded during map loading, transport updates, or server shutdowns.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    TransportPathLeg leg;\n    // ... use leg\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when leg goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'TransportPathLeg* leg = new TransportPathLeg();

      // ... use leg ...

      delete leg; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to note that TransportPathLeg objects are typically
    managed through smart pointers or container classes in TrinityCore, which handle
    destruction automatically.
