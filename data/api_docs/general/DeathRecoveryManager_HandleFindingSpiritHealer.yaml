documentation:
  brief: Processes the logic for finding and interacting with a spirit healer after
    player death.
  description: The HandleFindingSpiritHealer method manages the game mechanics involved
    in locating and communicating with a spirit healer when a player dies. This typically
    occurs during the death recovery process, where the system identifies an appropriate
    spirit healer NPC near the player's death location. The method likely handles
    the timing and state transitions required to initiate the spirit healer interaction,
    potentially including checking for valid healer availability, triggering the appropriate
    UI elements, or managing the transition from death state back to life. This method
    is part of the broader Death Recovery system that governs how players are handled
    after dying in World of Warcraft.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    m_deathRecoveryManager.HandleFindingSpiritHealer(diff);\n    // ... other\
      \ updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within a periodic update loop as part of
    the Death Recovery system. It may involve checking for nearby spirit healer NPCs,
    validating their state, and potentially triggering visual or audio effects to
    guide the player toward recovery. The 'diff' parameter suggests it's designed
    to work with game tick timing for proper scheduling.
  warnings: This method is part of a critical gameplay flow that affects player experience
    during death states. Improper implementation could lead to players being unable
    to recover from death or experiencing incorrect healer interactions. Ensure proper
    state management when calling this method.
