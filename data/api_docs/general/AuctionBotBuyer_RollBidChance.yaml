api:
  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: RollBidChance
  signature: bool AuctionBotBuyer::RollBidChance(const BuyerItemInfo * ahInfo, const
    int * auction, uint32 bidPrice)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the auction bot should place a bid on an auction item
    based on configured buyer rules and current auction conditions.
  description: The RollBidChance method evaluates if the AuctionBotBuyer should submit
    a bid for a given auction item. It takes into account various buyer configuration
    parameters such as price thresholds, item quality requirements, and bidding strategies.
    The method uses the provided auction information and current bid price to calculate
    the probability or decision of placing a bid. This function is typically called
    during the auction bot's scanning process when it encounters items that match
    its configured buyer criteria. It ensures that bids are only placed when they
    align with the buyer's defined rules, preventing unnecessary bidding and optimizing
    resource usage.
  parameters:
  - name: ahInfo
    description: Pointer to BuyerItemInfo structure containing information about the
      auction item being evaluated for bidding.
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing auction data including
      item ID, owner, and other auction-specific details.
  - name: bidPrice
    description: The current bid price for the auction item that would be used if
      a bid is placed.
  returns: Returns true if the auction bot should place a bid on the specified auction
    item, false otherwise. This indicates whether the calculated chance or decision
    meets the buyer's configured conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in auction scanning
    code: "if (buyer.RollBidChance(&itemInfo, auctionData, currentBid)) {\n    //\
      \ Place bid logic here\n    bidder.PlaceBid(auctionId, currentBid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with auction bot bidding system
    code: "void AuctionBot::ProcessAuction(const AuctionEntry* auction) {\n    BuyerItemInfo\
      \ itemInfo;\n    // ... populate itemInfo from auction data\n    if (buyer.RollBidChance(&itemInfo,\
      \ auction->GetAuctionData(), auction->GetBid())) {\n        uint32 bidAmount\
      \ = CalculateBidAmount(auction);\n        bidder.PlaceBid(auction->GetId(),\
      \ bidAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the auction bot's decision-making process and relies
    heavily on buyer configuration settings. The implementation likely involves complex
    probability calculations or rule-based evaluations that consider item value, market
    trends, and bot-specific strategies. Performance is important as this method may
    be called frequently during auction scanning operations.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are properly validated before calling
    this method to prevent undefined behavior. The method assumes valid auction data
    structures and buyer configurations; incorrect data could lead to unexpected bidding
    decisions or errors.
