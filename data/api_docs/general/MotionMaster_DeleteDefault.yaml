  class: MotionMaster
  method: DeleteDefault
  signature: void MotionMaster::DeleteDefault(bool active, bool movementInform)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the default movement generator from the motion master's active movement
    list.
  description: The DeleteDefault method is responsible for removing the default movement
    generator from the MotionMaster's internal list of active movements. This typically
    occurs when a creature or unit needs to stop following its default movement behavior,
    such as when it is engaged in combat or when a custom movement is initiated. The
    method accepts two boolean parameters that control whether the removal should
    be applied to the active movement state and whether a movement inform callback
    should be triggered. This method is crucial for managing unit behavior transitions
    within the TrinityCore AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: If true, removes the default movement from the active movement list.
      If false, only performs cleanup without affecting the active state.
  - name: movementInform
    description: If true, triggers a movement inform callback to notify any listeners
      that the default movement has been deleted. If false, no notification is sent.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DeleteDefault
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->DeleteDefault(true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional deletion with movement inform
    code: "if (creature->IsInCombat()) {\n    MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();\n\
      \    mm->DeleteDefault(false, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the AI system when transitioning
    between different movement states. It's important to understand that calling this
    method may affect the unit's current behavior and should be done with consideration
    of the broader AI state machine.
  warnings: Improper use of DeleteDefault can lead to inconsistent movement behavior
    or unexpected AI transitions. Ensure that any movement inform callbacks are properly
    handled to avoid breaking the AI flow.
