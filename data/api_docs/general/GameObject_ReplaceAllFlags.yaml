  class: GameObject
  method: ReplaceAllFlags
  signature: void GameObject::ReplaceAllFlags(int flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all flags of the GameObject with the specified integer value.
  description: This method replaces all existing flags of the GameObject with a new
    integer value, effectively resetting the flag state. It is commonly used in game
    mechanics to modify object behavior or status during runtime operations. The method
    operates on the GameObject's internal flag system and can be used to set or clear
    specific flags based on the provided integer value.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The new integer value to replace all current flags with. This value
      represents the new flag state of the GameObject, where each bit corresponds
      to a different flag type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting flags for a GameObject
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->ReplaceAllFlags(128);

      // This sets the GameObject''s flags to 128, which may represent a specific
      state or behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly modifies the GameObject's
    flag state without any validation. It is typically used in conjunction with other
    flag-related methods for complete control over object states. Performance considerations
    include potential impact on object update routines if used frequently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior or game state
    corruption, especially when flags are not properly managed. Care should be taken
    to ensure that the replacement flags value is valid and consistent with expected
    game mechanics.
