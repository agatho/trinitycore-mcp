  class: HealerPositioning
  method: IsPositionSafeForHealing
  signature: bool HealerPositioning::IsPositionSafeForHealing(const int & pos, const
    CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified position is safe for performing healing actions
    based on combat context.
  description: The IsPositionSafeForHealing method evaluates if a given position within
    the game world is considered safe for a healer to perform healing operations without
    being immediately threatened by enemy units. This function takes into account
    various factors such as proximity to hostile targets, line of sight, and potential
    threat levels from nearby enemies. It is typically used by AI systems or scripted
    behaviors to make decisions about where to position healers during combat encounters.
    The method requires a valid combat context that defines the current state of the
    battlefield and enemy positions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing the position to evaluate for healing
      safety. This value usually corresponds to a specific location in the game world,
      potentially encoded as a coordinate or index within a predefined positioning
      system.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object that provides contextual information
      about the current combat situation, including enemy positions, threat levels,
      and other relevant battlefield data needed to determine safety.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is deemed safe for healing operations;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that the position may
    expose the healer to immediate danger or violate safety constraints defined in
    the combat context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check healing position safety
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\n// ... populate context with current enemy\
      \ positions and threat data ...\nint healPosition = 12345;\nbool isSafe = healerPositioning.IsPositionSafeForHealing(healPosition,\
      \ context);\nif (isSafe) {\n    // Proceed with healing at this position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to make strategic decisions
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\n// ... populate context ...\nfor (int i\
      \ = 0; i < totalPositions; ++i) {\n    if (healerPositioning.IsPositionSafeForHealing(i,\
      \ context)) {\n        // Select this position for healing\n        currentHealPosition\
      \ = i;\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving distance checks,
    line-of-sight determinations, and threat assessments. It may utilize internal
    caching or optimization techniques to improve performance during frequent calls
    in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatPositionContext passed to this method is up-to-date
    with current battlefield conditions; stale data can lead to incorrect safety evaluations
    and potentially dangerous healing positions.
