  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: UpdatePetSpeed
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::UpdatePetSpeed(Unit * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the speed of a pet based on its owner's movement state.
  description: The UpdatePetSpeed method adjusts the movement speed of a pet unit
    to match or synchronize with its owner's current movement state. This is typically
    used in conjunction with follow behavior where the pet should maintain a consistent
    distance and speed relative to the owner. The method ensures that the pet's speed
    parameters are correctly set according to the owner's movement type, whether walking,
    running, or standing still.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the owner of the pet. This
      parameter must not be null and should represent a valid unit that has movement
      properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pet AI Update
    code: "void PetAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_owner)\n        m_movementGenerator->UpdatePetSpeed(m_owner);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing Pet Speed with Owner During Movement
    code: "void FollowMovementGenerator::Update(Unit* owner, uint32 diff)\n{\n   \
      \ if (owner && owner->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        UpdatePetSpeed(owner);\n\
      \        // Continue with movement logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to ensure that pet
    movement remains synchronized with the owner. It may modify internal speed parameters
    of the pet unit and should be invoked only when the owner's movement state is
    valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'owner' parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The method assumes that the owner has valid movement properties set.
