  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::HasSituationChanged() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat state has changed since the last evaluation.
  description: The HasSituationChanged method evaluates the current combat state against
    a previously stored state to determine if any significant changes have occurred.
    This is commonly used in AI systems and combat logic to trigger actions or updates
    when the battle conditions shift. The method typically compares factors such as
    player position, target status, health levels, or environmental modifiers that
    affect combat dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat situation has changed since the last check;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates that the state of combat (e.g., engaged
    targets, health status, positioning) has been altered in a way that may require
    action or update.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.HasSituationChanged()) {\n    // React to changed combat situation\n\
      \    player->UpdateCombatState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains an internal state cache and performs a comparison
    operation. It's designed for performance-critical scenarios where frequent checks
    are needed but full state recomputation is expensive.
