documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object model is currently spawned and active
    in the world.
  description: The IsSpawned method checks the current state of a GameObjectModelOwnerBase
    instance to determine if its associated game object model has been spawned and
    is actively present in the game world. This method typically evaluates internal
    flags or state variables that indicate whether the object is initialized, loaded,
    and visible to players. The result is used by the TrinityCore server to manage
    object lifecycle, visibility, and interaction logic. This check is essential for
    determining if a game object can be interacted with, queried, or modified safely.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object model is currently spawned and active in
    the world; otherwise returns false if it is not spawned or has been removed from
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject is Spawned Before Interaction
    code: "if (gameObjectModelOwner->IsSpawned()) {\n    // Safe to interact with\
      \ the object\n    gameObjectModelOwner->Interact();\n} else {\n    // Object\
      \ not spawned, skip interaction\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"GameObject\
      \ not spawned, skipping interaction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game object update loops and event handling
    to ensure that operations on a GameObjectModelOwnerBase are only performed when
    the object is valid and active. It's important to note that this check does not
    validate the object's physical presence in a specific map or grid cell, but rather
    its overall spawning state within the server.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees the object will remain
    spawned during subsequent operations. Objects may be despawned between the time
    of the IsSpawned check and when an action is taken on the object. Always validate
    object state in critical sections where race conditions might occur.
