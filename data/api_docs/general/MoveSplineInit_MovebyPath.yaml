  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: MovebyPath
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::MovebyPath(const PointsArray & path, int32 pointId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spline movement along a specified path for an object.
  description: The MovebyPath method sets up a spline-based movement trajectory for
    an object using a predefined sequence of waypoints. This function is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to handle smooth character or creature
    movement along complex paths, such as flight paths, scripted sequences, or custom
    AI behaviors. The method configures the internal spline state with the provided
    path data and starting point identifier, preparing the object for execution of
    the movement animation. It does not immediately begin movement but rather initializes
    the necessary data structures for subsequent spline execution.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: A constant reference to a PointsArray containing the sequence of
      waypoints that define the movement path. Each point represents a coordinate
      in 3D space (X, Y, Z) that the object should traverse during the spline movement.
  - name: pointId
    description: An integer identifier specifying the starting point index within
      the provided path array. This value determines where along the path the movement
      should begin, with valid values typically ranging from 0 to the size of the
      path array minus one.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for initializing a creature's path movement
    code: 'PointsArray waypoints;

      waypoints.push_back(G3D::Vector3(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f));

      waypoints.push_back(G3D::Vector3(150.0f, 250.0f, 350.0f));

      waypoints.push_back(G3D::Vector3(200.0f, 300.0f, 400.0f));

      MoveSplineInit init;

      init.MovebyPath(waypoints, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MovebyPath with a dynamic path and custom starting point
    code: 'std::vector<G3D::Vector3> dynamicPath;

      dynamicPath.push_back(G3D::Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));

      dynamicPath.push_back(G3D::Vector3(10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f));

      dynamicPath.push_back(G3D::Vector3(20.0f, 20.0f, 20.0f));

      MoveSplineInit init;

      init.MovebyPath(dynamicPath, 1); // Start from second point'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method prepares the internal spline data structure but does not execute
    movement immediately. Movement execution typically occurs after calling MoveSplineInit::Move()
    or similar execution methods. The path array should be valid and contain at least
    one point, otherwise behavior is undefined. This function is commonly used in
    conjunction with other spline-related APIs for implementing complex AI behaviors
    or scripted events.
  warnings: Passing an invalid pointId that exceeds the path size may result in undefined
    behavior or runtime errors. Ensure all points in the path are valid and within
    acceptable coordinate ranges to prevent movement glitches or client-side issues.
    This method should not be called during active movement execution as it will overwrite
    existing spline data.
