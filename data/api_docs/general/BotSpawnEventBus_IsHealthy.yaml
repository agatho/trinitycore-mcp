documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot spawn event bus is in a healthy state and ready to process
    events
  description: The IsHealthy method evaluates the internal state of the BotSpawnEventBus
    to determine whether it is functioning correctly and capable of handling bot spawn-related
    events. This method typically checks for valid internal data structures, active
    connections, or other prerequisites necessary for the event bus to operate properly.
    It serves as a health check mechanism that can be used before attempting to dispatch
    events or perform operations on the bus. The method returns true if all internal
    conditions are met and false otherwise, indicating potential issues such as uninitialized
    components or failed system states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotSpawnEventBus is in a healthy state and ready to
    process events; returns false if the bus is unhealthy or has encountered an error
    condition that prevents normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Check
    code: "if (botSpawnEventBus.IsHealthy()) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawn operations\n\
      \    botSpawnEventBus.SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle unhealthy state\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"BotSpawnEventBus is not healthy\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Health Check in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player) {\n    if (botSpawnEventBus.IsHealthy())\
      \ {\n        // Trigger bot spawn logic\n        botSpawnEventBus.DispatchSpawnEvent(player);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Log error and potentially retry or notify admin\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Cannot spawn bots: event bus unhealthy\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and should not block execution for extended
    periods. It's recommended to cache the result of this check if it's being called
    frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Do not assume that a healthy state guarantees successful event dispatching;
    additional validation may be required depending on specific event types or system
    configurations.
