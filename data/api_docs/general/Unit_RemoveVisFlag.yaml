  class: Unit
  method: RemoveVisFlag
  signature: void Unit::RemoveVisFlag(UnitVisFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a visibility flag from the unit, affecting how the unit appears to
    other players.
  description: This method removes a specific visibility flag from the Unit's visibility
    flags, which determines how the unit is displayed to other players in the game
    world. The visibility flags control whether the unit is visible or hidden to observers,
    and this method specifically removes one or more flags from the unit's current
    set of visibility flags. This functionality is commonly used during stealth operations,
    invisibility effects, or when managing unit visibility in various game scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitVisFlags value to remove from the unit's visibility flags.
      This parameter specifies which visibility flag(s) should be removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a single visibility flag
    code: Unit::RemoveVisFlag(UnitVisFlags::VIS_FLAG_SNEAK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple visibility flags
    code: Unit::RemoveVisFlag(UnitVisFlags::VIS_FLAG_SNEAK | UnitVisFlags::VIS_FLAG_HIDE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddVisFlag to manage visibility
    states. The implementation may involve bitwise operations on the unit's visibility
    flags, and it should be noted that removing a flag does not necessarily mean the
    unit becomes visible to all players - it depends on other factors such as stealth
    or invisibility effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visibility states for
    units, potentially causing issues with gameplay mechanics such as stealth detection
    or player visibility. Care should be taken when removing flags to ensure that
    the intended visibility state is maintained.
