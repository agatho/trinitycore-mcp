documentation:
  brief: Populates internal GUID mappings for player data processing
  description: The PopulateGuids method initializes and fills internal data structures
    with unique identifier (GUID) information for player entities. This method is
    typically invoked during player data serialization or dump operations to ensure
    all GUID references are properly resolved and stored. It prepares the PlayerDumpWriter
    instance for subsequent operations that require accurate GUID tracking. The method
    likely processes player-related data to establish consistent mapping between various
    identifiers used within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player dump context
    code: 'PlayerDumpWriter writer;

      writer.PopulateGuids(12345);

      // Prepares internal GUID mappings for player with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger player data serialization pipeline
    and may be called internally by other methods in the PlayerDumpWriter class. The
    exact implementation details depend on how GUIDs are stored and managed within
    the TrinityCore database structure.
