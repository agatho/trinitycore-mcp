  method: SetModHaste
  signature: void Unit::SetModHaste(float haste)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the haste modifier for the unit, affecting spell casting speed and attack
    speed.
  description: This method modifies the haste value of a Unit, which influences how
    quickly spells are cast and how fast attacks occur. Haste affects both melee and
    spell attack speeds, making the unit perform actions faster. The parameter represents
    a percentage change in haste, where positive values increase haste while negative
    values decrease it. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to adjust combat
    performance or apply buffs/debuffs.
  parameters:
  - name: haste
    description: The haste modifier value to be applied to the unit. Positive values
      increase haste, negative values decrease it. The value is typically expressed
      as a percentage change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Haste Setting Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetPlayer();

      target->SetModHaste(10.0f); // Apply 10% haste'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal haste calculations and may affect the
    unit's attack speed and spell casting time. It should be used carefully as it
    can impact combat performance and game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or incorrect
    combat mechanics. The value should be within reasonable limits to avoid causing
    performance issues or game-breaking effects.
