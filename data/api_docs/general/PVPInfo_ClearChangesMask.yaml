documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the PVPInfo object, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask within
    a PVPInfo object. This mask is typically used to track which properties or states
    of the player's PvP information have been modified since the last update or synchronization.
    By clearing this mask, the object transitions back to a clean state where no changes
    are marked as pending. This method is commonly invoked after synchronizing PvP
    data with clients or when resetting the PvP state for a player. The operation
    does not affect the actual PvP statistics or data stored in the object, only the
    tracking mechanism for changes.

  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Sync
    code: 'PVPInfo* pvpInfo = player->GetPVPInfo();

      pvpInfo->ClearChangesMask();

      // PVP data is now considered synchronized with client'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with PvP data synchronization
    routines. It's important to understand that clearing the mask does not alter the
    underlying PvP statistics or achievements; it only resets the change tracking
    mechanism.
