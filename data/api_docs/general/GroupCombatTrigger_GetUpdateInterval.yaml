  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 GroupCombatTrigger::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds for the group combat trigger.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval, measured
    in milliseconds, at which the GroupCombatTrigger performs its periodic checks
    or updates. This interval determines how frequently the trigger evaluates group
    combat conditions, such as detecting when players enter or leave combat zones,
    or assessing group member statuses. The value is typically set during object initialization
    and remains constant throughout the object's lifetime. This method is crucial
    for maintaining performance by ensuring that combat-related logic doesn't run
    too frequently, while still providing timely responses to group combat events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the group combat trigger should perform its periodic updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      uint32 interval = trigger->GetUpdateInterval();

      // interval now contains the update frequency in milliseconds

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interval for Timing Logic
    code: "void ProcessGroupCombat(GroupCombatTrigger* trigger) {\n    uint32 interval\
      \ = trigger->GetUpdateInterval();\n    // Use interval to schedule next update\
      \ or log timing info\n    printf(\"Combat trigger update interval: %u ms\\n\"\
      , interval);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any computation. The
    returned value should be treated as read-only and is typically configured during
    the initialization of the GroupCombatTrigger object. Performance considerations
    include ensuring that the update interval is not too short to avoid excessive
    CPU usage, but also not too long to maintain responsive combat detection.
