documentation:
  brief: Moves the ownership of an OPvPCapturePoint object to another instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for OPvPCapturePoint transfers all resources
    and state from the right-hand side object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where an OPvPCapturePoint needs to be reassigned
    or relocated within the game's PvP capture system. The method ensures that any
    existing resources held by the current object are properly cleaned up before acquiring
    resources from the source object. This is particularly relevant in dynamic PvP
    environments where capture points may be repositioned or replaced during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current OPvPCapturePoint object after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'OPvPCapturePoint point1;

      OPvPCapturePoint point2 = std::move(point1); // Move assignment

      // point1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation, which means it transfers ownership
    of resources rather than copying them. The source object (right-hand side) will
    be left in a valid but unspecified state after the operation.
  warnings: Be cautious when using move assignment with objects that are currently
    in use or referenced elsewhere, as the source object may become invalid or unusable
    after the operation.
