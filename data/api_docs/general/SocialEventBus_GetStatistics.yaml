documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics for social event handling within the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a structured set of performance
    and operational metrics related to social events in the game. These statistics
    typically include counts of processed events, average processing times, and other
    relevant data that helps monitor the health and efficiency of the social event
    system. The returned Statistics object is immutable, ensuring thread safety when
    accessed from multiple threads. This method does not modify any internal state
    and can be called at any time during server operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics structure containing various metrics
    about social event processing, such as total events handled, average latency,
    error counts, and other relevant operational data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Social Event Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = sSocialEventBus->GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Events: " << stats.totalEvents << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average Latency: " << stats.averageLatencyMs << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Statistics object returned by this method is read-only and should not
    be modified. It's designed to be thread-safe for concurrent access, making it
    suitable for monitoring from various parts of the server without locking concerns.
