  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsJunkItem(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item is classified as junk within the NPC interaction
    system.
  description: The IsJunkItem method evaluates whether a given Item object is considered
    junk by the NPC interaction manager. This classification typically determines
    how the item is handled during vendor interactions, loot distribution, or other
    NPC-related transactions. The method checks various item properties such as quality,
    item level, and category to make this determination. It's commonly used in the
    context of vendor systems where certain items should be automatically sold or
    ignored.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as junk; otherwise returns false.
    Junk items are typically low-value items that do not provide significant benefit
    to players and may be automatically sold by vendors.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an item is junk before selling
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, slot);\nif (item\
      \ && npcInteractionManager->IsJunkItem(item)) {\n    // Handle junk item logic\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"This item is considered junk and\
      \ will be sold automatically.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely uses internal item classification tables or rules
    based on item quality, level, and type. This method may be called frequently during
    vendor interactions, so performance optimization is important for large inventories.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an item can be sold in
    general, as it specifically checks for 'junk' classification which is distinct
    from sellable items. Items classified as junk might still have value in certain
    contexts like crafting or trading.
