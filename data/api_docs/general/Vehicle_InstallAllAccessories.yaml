  signature: void Vehicle::InstallAllAccessories(bool evading)
documentation:
  brief: Installs all vehicle accessories for the current vehicle instance.
  description: The InstallAllAccessories method is responsible for equipping all registered
    accessories to a vehicle. This method typically handles the placement and activation
    of passenger seats, weapon mounts, and other vehicle-specific enhancements. It
    ensures that all accessory objects associated with the vehicle are properly installed
    and configured within the game world. The method may also handle the synchronization
    of accessory states with the vehicle's overall functionality, including any evading
    behavior if specified.
  parameters:
  - name: evading
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether the accessories should be installed
      with evading behavior enabled. When true, accessories may be configured to respond
      to combat situations or evade certain interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Accessory Installation
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->InstallAllAccessories(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Accessory Installation with Evading Behavior
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->InstallAllAccessories(true);\n\
      \    // Accessories will now respond to combat evasive actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid vehicle instances. It is typically
    invoked during vehicle creation or activation sequences. The method may trigger
    additional events related to accessory installation, such as seat placement or
    weapon mounting notifications.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null vehicle pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the vehicle instance is valid before invoking this method.
    Improper use of the evading parameter may cause unexpected accessory behavior
    during combat scenarios.
