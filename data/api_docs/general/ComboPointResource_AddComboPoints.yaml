  class: ComboPointResource
  method: AddComboPoints
  signature: void ComboPointResource::AddComboPoints(uint32 points)
documentation:
  brief: Adds combo points to the player's combo point resource.
  description: The AddComboPoints method increases the current number of combo points
    for a player character. This is typically used in combat scenarios where abilities
    or attacks grant additional combo points, such as when using finisher moves or
    specific rogue abilities. The method directly modifies the internal combo point
    counter without any validation checks on the input value. Combo points are a core
    resource in World of Warcraft's rogue class gameplay, used to fuel powerful abilities
    like Slice and Dice, Eviscerate, and other finishers.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The number of combo points to add to the current resource. Must be
      a non-negative integer representing the amount of combo points to increase by.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage adding combo points
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ComboPointResource* comboResource = player->GetComboPointResource();

      comboResource->AddComboPoints(1); // Adds one combo point'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple combo points in a combat scenario
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ComboPointResource* comboResource = player->GetComboPointResource();

      comboResource->AddComboPoints(3); // Adds three combo points, useful for burst
      damage abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal combo point counter and does not
    perform any checks to ensure that the resulting value does not exceed the maximum
    allowed combo points (typically 5). It is expected that higher-level systems or
    game logic will handle such validation. The method operates on the player's combo
    point resource, which is managed separately from other resources like mana or
    energy.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may cause undefined behavior
    if not handled properly by the calling code. Additionally, since combo points
    are capped at 5 in most cases, adding more than 5 points without resetting or
    clamping could lead to unexpected gameplay behavior. Ensure that combo point management
    logic properly handles overflow conditions.
