  brief: Handles combat logic when the Monk AI encounters multiple enemies.
  description: The HandleMultipleEnemies method is responsible for managing the behavior
    of a Monk AI character when it engages with more than one enemy target. This method
    typically adjusts the AI's strategy, such as selecting optimal abilities, prioritizing
    targets, or switching between different combat states based on the number of enemies
    present. It ensures that the Monk AI effectively utilizes its abilities in multi-target
    scenarios while maintaining proper threat management and resource allocation.

    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Get number of enemies\n        int enemyCount = GetEnemiesInRange();\n\
      \        HandleMultipleEnemies(enemyCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when the Monk is
    in combat. It may modify internal state variables such as target selection priority
    or ability usage patterns based on enemy count.
