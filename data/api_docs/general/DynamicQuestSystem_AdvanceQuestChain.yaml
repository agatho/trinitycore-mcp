  method: AdvanceQuestChain
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AdvanceQuestChain(Player * bot, uint32 completedQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Advances a player's quest chain by completing the specified quest and triggering
    any associated follow-up quests.
  description: The AdvanceQuestChain method is used to progress a player's quest chain
    in the Dynamic Quest System. When invoked, it marks the specified quest as completed
    for the given player and automatically advances the quest state to the next available
    quest in the chain, if one exists. This method handles the internal logic of quest
    progression, including updating quest status, awarding experience or rewards,
    and potentially spawning new quest givers or objects related to the next quest
    in the sequence. It is typically called when a player has successfully completed
    a quest objective and the system needs to move them forward in their quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      chain will be advanced.
  - name: completedQuestId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that has been completed by
      the player. This ID must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Chain Advancement
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      DynamicQuestSystem::AdvanceQuestChain(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advancing Quest Chain with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif (player->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::AdvanceQuestChain(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest being completed is valid and exists in
    the database. It also relies on proper quest chain definitions within the game's
    quest system to determine which quests follow the completed one. The method does
    not perform any checks for quest prerequisites or player eligibility beyond ensuring
    the quest ID is valid.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior
    or errors within the quest system. Ensure that the quest ID corresponds to a real,
    active quest before calling this function. Additionally, avoid calling this method
    during critical quest events where state changes might conflict with other systems.
