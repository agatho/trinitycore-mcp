  class: Unit
  method: SetExtraUnitMovementFlags2
  signature: void Unit::SetExtraUnitMovementFlags2(uint32 f)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extra movement flags for a unit, enabling specific game mechanics
    behaviors.
  description: This method allows developers to set additional movement flags that
    control how a unit moves within the game world. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with other movement-related methods to define unit behavior during various game
    events such as combat, movement, or special abilities. The method modifies internal
    flags that affect how the unit's movement is processed by the server, particularly
    in relation to pathfinding and movement updates.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The uint32 value representing the extra movement flags to be set.
      This value should be a bitmask combining specific flag values that define various
      movement behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Extra Movement Flags
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->SetExtraUnitMovementFlags2(0x00000001); // Set flag for specific movement
      behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal movement flags of a unit, which
    may affect pathfinding calculations and movement updates. It should be used carefully
    as it can alter how units behave in combat or during special abilities.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unexpected behavior in unit
    movement, especially if flags are set incorrectly or without proper understanding
    of their meaning. Avoid setting conflicting flags that may cause movement issues.
