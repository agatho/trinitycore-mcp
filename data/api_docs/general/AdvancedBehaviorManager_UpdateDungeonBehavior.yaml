documentation:
  brief: Updates the dungeon behavior logic for all active dungeon encounters in the
    world.
  description: The UpdateDungeonBehavior method is responsible for processing and
    updating the behavior state of all active dungeon encounters within the TrinityCore
    instance. This method is typically called from the main game loop to ensure that
    dungeon-specific AI behaviors, quest conditions, and encounter mechanics are properly
    maintained. It handles the progression of dungeon events, manages mob AI states,
    processes quest objectives, and ensures that dungeon-specific triggers and timers
    are correctly updated. The method operates on a per-tick basis using the provided
    time delta (diff) to maintain consistent behavior updates across all active dungeons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateDungeonBehavior(diff);\n    // ... more\
      \ update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked every game tick by the core update system.
    It's important to note that this method may perform significant processing for
    all active dungeons, so it should be called efficiently without causing performance
    bottlenecks. The implementation likely uses internal caching and state tracking
    to minimize redundant operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from non-main threads as it may access
    shared dungeon data structures that are not thread-safe. This method modifies
    global dungeon states and should only be invoked in the main game update context.
