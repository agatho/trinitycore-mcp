  class: FlameShockTracker
  method: GetActiveFlameShockCount
  signature: uint32 FlameShockTracker::GetActiveFlameShockCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active Flame Shock effects on the target.
  description: The GetActiveFlameShockCount method retrieves the number of currently
    active Flame Shock debuffs applied to a unit. This method is typically used in
    combat calculations and spell effect tracking within the TrinityCore framework.
    The count reflects all active instances of the Flame Shock spell that are currently
    affecting the target, regardless of their source or duration remaining. This value
    is crucial for determining stacking behavior, damage calculations, and cooldown
    management related to Flame Shock abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active Flame Shock effects
    currently applied to the target unit. Returns 0 if no Flame Shock effects are
    active.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Active Flame Shock Count
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Some target unit\nFlameShockTracker* tracker = target->GetFlameShockTracker();\n\
      uint32 count = tracker->GetActiveFlameShockCount();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Apply additional effects based on active Flame Shock count\n    // For\
      \ example, increasing damage or applying stacking bonuses\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the target unit has a valid FlameShockTracker component.
    The implementation likely maintains an internal counter or list of active Flame
    Shock effects and returns the current count. Performance is generally O(1) as
    it's typically implemented as a simple counter rather than iterating through effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit actually supports FlameShock tracking before
    calling this method to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. The returned value
    may change between calls if Flame Shock effects are applied or removed during
    the same combat tick.
