documentation:
  brief: Prevents the application of auras on targets hit by the spell
  description: The PreventHitAura method is used within SpellScript implementations
    to block the application of auras to targets that would normally be affected by
    the spell. This method modifies the spell's behavior during the hit phase, ensuring
    that any aura effects intended for the target are not applied. It is typically
    called during the spell's execution flow when specific conditions need to prevent
    aura application, such as in certain immunity or protection mechanics. The method
    does not take any parameters and has no return value, serving purely as a control
    mechanism within the spell script lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHit()\n\
      \    {\n        if (GetHitUnit()->HasAura(12345))\n            PreventHitAura();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the appropriate spell script phase, typically
    within a hit handler or similar event callback. It affects only the aura application
    phase and does not prevent other effects of the spell from occurring.
  warnings: Using PreventHitAura inappropriately may lead to unexpected behavior in
    spell mechanics. Ensure that the condition for calling this method is well-defined
    to avoid unintended aura blocking.
