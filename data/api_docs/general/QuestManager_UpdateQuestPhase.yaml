documentation:
  brief: Updates the phase of active quests for a player based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateQuestPhase method processes and updates the current phase
    of all active quests assigned to a player. It evaluates quest conditions, checks
    for phase changes, and ensures that quest progress is accurately reflected in
    the game state. This method is typically called during the game loop to maintain
    up-to-date quest information. The method does not require any parameters as it
    operates on the internal quest state of the player object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all active quests\
      \ for players\n    for (auto& player : m_players)\n    {\n        player->GetQuestManager()->UpdateQuestPhase(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core game loop. It internally
    manages quest phase transitions and updates quest state based on time-based conditions
    or player actions. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom quest systems.
