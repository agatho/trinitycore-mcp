  class: WorldObject
  method: SetName
  signature: void WorldObject::SetName(std::string newname)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the name of the WorldObject to the specified string value.
  description: The SetName method assigns a new name to a WorldObject instance. This
    method is typically used to dynamically change the display name of game entities
    such as players, creatures, or game objects. The name is stored internally and
    may be used for identification purposes within the game world. This operation
    does not automatically broadcast the name change to other players or update the
    object's visual representation in all contexts; additional logic may be required
    for full synchronization. The method accepts a std::string parameter representing
    the new name, which should adhere to valid naming conventions for World of Warcraft
    objects.
  parameters:
  - name: newname
    description: The new name to assign to the WorldObject. Must be a valid string
      that conforms to World of Warcraft naming rules and length restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's Name
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetName("NewPlayerName");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Creature's Name
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetName("AncientGuardian");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal name field of the WorldObject. It does
    not trigger any automatic updates to the client-side display or network synchronization.
    For persistent changes that affect other players, additional methods like SendNameUpdate()
    may be required depending on the object type.
  warnings: Be cautious when setting names that might conflict with existing objects
    in the same zone or world. Invalid or empty strings could lead to undefined behavior
    or client-side issues if not properly validated before calling this method.
