  class: AddonChannelCommandHandler
  method: IsHumanReadable
  signature: bool AddonChannelCommandHandler::IsHumanReadable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the addon channel command handler is configured to provide
    human-readable output.
  description: The IsHumanReadable method checks if the AddonChannelCommandHandler
    instance is set to format its output in a way that is easily understandable by
    players. This flag typically controls whether debug or technical information is
    presented in a user-friendly format versus raw data. The method returns true when
    the handler is configured for human-readable output, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is particularly relevant in command-line interfaces or chat-based
    tools where the same command might be used for both debugging purposes and general
    player interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the command handler is configured to produce human-readable
    output; returns false if it's set to produce raw or technical output.
  examples:
  - title: Check Human Readability Configuration
    code: "AddonChannelCommandHandler handler;\nif (handler.IsHumanReadable()) {\n\
      \    // Output formatted for players\n    std::cout << \"Player-friendly message\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Output formatted for debugging\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Technical data\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's command system to determine
    how output should be formatted based on the context of use. It may be influenced
    by configuration settings or command flags that control verbosity.
