  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: PlanZoneCompletion
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::PlanZoneCompletion(Player * bot, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules zone completion logic for a player bot within the dynamic quest
    system.
  description: The PlanZoneCompletion method is responsible for initiating or scheduling
    the processing of zone completion events for a specified player bot. This function
    likely integrates with the dynamic quest system's internal state management to
    track progress, trigger rewards, or update quest objectives upon a bot entering
    or completing a specific zone. It may also handle cleanup or notification tasks
    related to zone-based quest progression. The method operates asynchronously and
    is typically invoked during gameplay events such as zone transitions or quest
    completion checks.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which zone
      completion logic should be planned. Must not be null.
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier of the zone that is being completed or entered
      by the bot. Should correspond to a valid zone in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      uint32 currentZoneId = 1234;

      DynamicQuestSystem::PlanZoneCompletion(myBot, currentZoneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an asynchronous quest processing system and
    may not execute immediately. It should be called from within a valid game context
    where player state and zone information are accessible.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and that the zoneId corresponds
    to an actual zone in the game world; otherwise, unexpected behavior or crashes
    might occur.
