  signature: int & WorldSession::GetQueryProcessor()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the query processor identifier associated with this
    session
  description: The GetQueryProcessor method retrieves a reference to an integer identifier
    that represents the query processor assigned to this WorldSession. This identifier
    is typically used internally by TrinityCore to manage and route database queries
    originating from specific client sessions. The returned reference allows direct
    access to modify the processor ID if needed, though such modifications should
    be handled carefully to maintain session integrity. This method is commonly utilized
    in the context of database query management and session tracking within the World
    of Warcraft server architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the query processor identifier for
    this session. This value typically corresponds to a unique identifier used internally
    by the TrinityCore database layer to associate queries with specific client sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Query Processor ID
    code: 'int& processorId = session->GetQueryProcessor();

      processorId = 42; // Modify the processor ID if needed

      std::cout << "Current processor ID: " << processorId << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of WorldSession.
    Modifying this value directly may affect how database queries are processed for
    this session. Ensure proper synchronization if accessing from multiple threads.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned reference can lead to inconsistent
    state if not properly managed. This method should be used with caution in multi-threaded
    environments where session data might be accessed concurrently.
