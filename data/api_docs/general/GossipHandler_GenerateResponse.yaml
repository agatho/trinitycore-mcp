  class: GossipHandler
  method: GenerateResponse
  signature: std::string GossipHandler::GenerateResponse(::Player * bot, const std::string
    & boxText) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a formatted gossip response string for a player based on provided
    text.
  description: The GenerateResponse method constructs and returns a properly formatted
    gossip dialog string that can be used to display interactive options or messages
    to a player in the World of Warcraft client. This method is typically invoked
    by AI scripts or quest handlers to dynamically create gossip content based on
    the current state or context. The generated response includes appropriate formatting
    for the game's gossip system, ensuring compatibility with TrinityCore's gossip
    handling mechanisms. It takes into account the player's current interaction state
    and applies necessary transformations to make the text suitable for display in
    a gossip menu.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the NPC or bot that will
      generate the response. This parameter determines the context and potential responses
      based on the character's state.
  - name: boxText
    description: The input text string that will be used as the main content or message
      in the generated gossip response. This can include quest descriptions, dialogue
      lines, or menu options.
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted gossip response that can be directly
    sent to the player's client for display in a gossip dialog window.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Response Generation
    code: 'std::string response = gossipHandler.GenerateResponse(playerBot, "Hello,
      adventurer! How may I assist you?");

      // Sends formatted gossip dialog to player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Gossip Based on Player State
    code: "if (player->HasQuest(12345)) {\n    std::string response = gossipHandler.GenerateResponse(playerBot,\
      \ \"You have completed the quest! Here is your reward.\");\n} else {\n    std::string\
      \ response = gossipHandler.GenerateResponse(playerBot, \"Welcome to our town.\
      \ Would you like to hear about our quests?\");\n}\n// Displays different responses\
      \ based on player's quest status"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GossipHandler class and is commonly used in AI
    scripting for NPCs. The returned string must be properly formatted to work with
    TrinityCore's gossip system. Ensure that the input text does not exceed client
    limitations or cause UI issues when displayed.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to the 'bot' parameter as this will likely cause
    undefined behavior. Make sure the 'boxText' is sanitized and safe for display
    to avoid potential exploits or client-side crashes.
