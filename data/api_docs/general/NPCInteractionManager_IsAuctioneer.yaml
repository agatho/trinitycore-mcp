  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsAuctioneer(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified creature is an auctioneer NPC.
  description: The IsAuctioneer method checks if a given Creature object represents
    an auctioneer within the World of Warcraft game environment. This function is
    typically used by the NPC interaction system to identify special NPC types that
    handle auction house operations. The method performs a lookup against internal
    NPC type data or flags to determine if the creature has the auctioneer behavior
    enabled. It's commonly called during player interaction events to route appropriate
    UI elements or actions to auctioneer NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified creature is an auctioneer, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates whether the NPC should be treated as an auction house
    vendor for interaction purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auctioneer Check
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->IsAuctioneer(npc)) {\n    player->SendAuctionMenu(npc);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Based on NPC Type
    code: "Creature* targetNPC = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith();\nif (targetNPC\
      \ && npcInteractionManager->IsAuctioneer(targetNPC)) {\n    // Handle auctioneer-specific\
      \ interaction\n    player->SendAuctionMenu(targetNPC);\n} else if (targetNPC)\
      \ {\n    // Handle regular NPC interaction\n    player->OnNPCInteraction(targetNPC);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal NPC flags or database entries that
    define which creatures are classified as auctioneers. The implementation may cache
    results for performance reasons in high-frequency interaction scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure the Creature pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    potential crashes. The method assumes proper initialization of NPC data structures
    and should not be called on uninitialized or destroyed NPC objects.
