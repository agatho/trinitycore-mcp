  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CreateResourceConservationProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new resource conservation profile for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The CreateResourceConservationProfile method initializes and sets up
    a new resource conservation profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile
    defines how the system should manage and conserve resources such as CPU, memory,
    or network usage when executing AI behaviors. The method is typically invoked
    during system initialization or when dynamic adjustment of resource management
    strategies is required. It ensures that the adaptive behavior system operates
    efficiently under varying load conditions by establishing appropriate conservation
    parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetInstance();

      manager->CreateResourceConservationProfile();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the AdaptiveBehaviorManager has been
    properly initialized. The created profile will become active immediately and may
    affect ongoing AI behavior execution.
