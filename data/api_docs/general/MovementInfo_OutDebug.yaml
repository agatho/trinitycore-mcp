  signature: void MovementInfo::OutDebug()
documentation:
  brief: Outputs detailed debug information about movement data for diagnostic purposes
  description: The OutDebug method provides comprehensive debugging output for MovementInfo
    objects, displaying all relevant movement-related data including position coordinates,
    orientation, velocity, and movement flags. This method is primarily used during
    development and debugging to inspect the state of player or creature movement
    data in real-time. The output typically includes information such as current location,
    facing direction, speed values, and various movement states that help developers
    understand how entities are moving within the game world. It serves as a diagnostic
    tool for identifying movement-related issues or verifying movement behavior during
    development.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Output
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      // ... populate movementInfo with data ...

      movementInfo.OutDebug();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Player Movement
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_MOVING))\n{\n\
      \    player->GetMovementInfo().OutDebug();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically outputs to the console or debug log and should only
    be used during development or debugging sessions. The output format may vary depending
    on the build configuration (debug vs release). Performance impact is minimal as
    it's designed for diagnostic use only, not for regular gameplay operations.
  warnings: The OutDebug method should never be called in production code or performance-critical
    sections as it's intended purely for development and debugging purposes. Excessive
    use during active gameplay can flood the debug output and potentially impact performance.
