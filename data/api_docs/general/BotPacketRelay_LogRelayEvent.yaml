    packet, size_t recipients)
documentation:
  brief: Logs relay events for bot packets including recipient information and packet
    details
  description: The LogRelayEvent method records information about packet relaying
    operations performed by bots within the TrinityCore framework. It captures details
    such as the bot player involved, the WorldPacket being relayed, and the number
    of recipients the packet was sent to. This functionality is typically used for
    debugging, monitoring, or auditing purposes in bot-related systems. The method
    does not modify any state but rather serves as a logging mechanism to track packet
    relay activities. It requires valid pointers to both the Player object representing
    the bot and the WorldPacket being relayed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is relaying
      the packet. Must be a valid pointer to an existing player instance.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket object being relayed. Must be a valid
      pointer to an existing packet with initialized data.
  - name: recipients
    description: Size_t value representing the number of recipients the packet was
      sent to. Should be a non-negative integer indicating the count of target players
      or entities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot relay system
    code: "void MyBotSystem::RelayPacketToTargets(Player* bot, WorldPacket* packet,\
      \ size_t numRecipients)\n{\n    // Perform relay logic here\n    BotPacketRelay\
      \ relay;\n    relay.LogRelayEvent(bot, packet, numRecipients);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging with additional context
    code: "void BotManager::HandleBotPacketRelay(Player* bot, WorldPacket* packet)\n\
      {\n    size_t recipientCount = GetTargetCountForPacket(packet);\n    if (recipientCount\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        sBotPacketRelay->LogRelayEvent(bot, packet, recipientCount);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with logging subsystems to maintain
    audit trails of bot activities. It's important that the provided Player and WorldPacket
    pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The
    method itself is non-blocking and does not perform any network operations or modifications
    to the packet data.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'packet' parameters are valid pointers before
    invoking this method. Passing null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, be cautious about logging sensitive packet contents in production environments
    without proper sanitization.
