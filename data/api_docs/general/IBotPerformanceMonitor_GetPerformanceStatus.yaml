  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetPerformanceStatus
  signature: std::string IBotPerformanceMonitor::GetPerformanceStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a formatted string containing current performance monitoring status
    for bot systems.
  description: The GetPerformanceStatus method returns a detailed string representation
    of the current performance metrics and status of bot operations within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes information about CPU usage, memory consumption, active
    bot count, and any performance warnings or thresholds that may be exceeded. The
    returned string is formatted for easy reading and can be used for logging, debugging,
    or monitoring purposes. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe
    to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted performance status report with key
    metrics such as CPU usage percentage, memory usage, active bot count, and performance
    warnings if applicable. Returns an empty string if no performance data is available
    or if monitoring is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = sBotPerformanceMonitor;\nstd::string\
      \ status = monitor->GetPerformanceStatus();\nif (!status.empty()) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot Performance Status: \" << status << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No performance data available.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Performance Data
    code: "void LogBotPerformance() {\n    IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = sBotPerformanceMonitor;\n\
      \    std::string status = monitor->GetPerformanceStatus();\n    if (!status.empty())\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"[BOT_PERFORMANCE] %s\", status.c_str());\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance
    degradation when called frequently. The returned string format may vary between
    different versions of TrinityCore. The monitoring system must be enabled for meaningful
    data to be returned.
  warnings: The method returns an empty string if performance monitoring is disabled
    or if no data is available, so always check the return value before processing.
    In high-load scenarios, frequent calls to this method might introduce minor overhead
    due to data collection operations.
