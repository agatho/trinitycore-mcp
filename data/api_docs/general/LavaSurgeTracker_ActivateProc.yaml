documentation:
  brief: Activates the Lava Surge proc effect for the player
  description: The ActivateProc method triggers the Lava Surge talent's proc behavior,
    which grants the player a temporary buff that increases the damage of their next
    Chain Lightning spell. This method is typically called when the conditions for
    the proc are met, such as after landing a critical strike with a lava-based spell.
    The activation may involve setting internal state flags, applying visual effects,
    and modifying spell damage calculations for subsequent abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LavaSurgeTracker* tracker = player->GetLavaSurgeTracker();\nif (tracker\
      \ && tracker->IsProcActive()) {\n    tracker->ActivateProc();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Lava Surge proc conditions are
    satisfied. The internal state of the tracker must be properly initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling ActivateProc without verifying that the proc conditions are met
    may lead to incorrect gameplay behavior or visual glitches. Ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multi-threaded contexts.
