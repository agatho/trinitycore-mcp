  method: _Spline
  signature: const MySpline & MoveSpline::_Spline() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the internal MySpline object representing
    the movement spline for this MoveSpline instance.
  description: The _Spline() method provides access to the internal MySpline data
    structure that defines the path and animation parameters for a character's movement.
    This method is typically used by the TrinityCore movement system to retrieve spline
    information for processing or serialization. The returned reference points to
    an immutable version of the spline, ensuring thread safety during read operations.
    It is commonly invoked when calculating movement states, interpolating positions,
    or determining the current stage of a character's motion. The method assumes that
    the MoveSpline object has been properly initialized with valid spline data before
    calling.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the internal MySpline object which contains all
    the data necessary to define and compute the movement path, including waypoints,
    timing, and interpolation parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Spline Data for Movement Calculation
    code: 'const MySpline& spline = moveSpline._Spline();

      float currentX = spline.getPoint(0).x;

      float currentY = spline.getPoint(0).y;

      float currentZ = spline.getPoint(0).z;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieving Spline for Path Validation
    code: "const MySpline& spline = moveSpline._Spline();\nif (spline.getPointCount()\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Process spline points\n    for (int i = 0; i < spline.getPointCount();\
      \ ++i) {\n        const auto& point = spline.getPoint(i);\n        // Validate\
      \ or log movement data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe for read operations. The returned
    MySpline reference should not be modified directly as it's intended to be immutable.
    If modifications are needed, a copy of the spline should be made first.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned MySpline object directly as it may lead to
    undefined behavior or inconsistent movement states. Always treat the returned
    reference as read-only.
