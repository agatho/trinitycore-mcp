  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool SplineChainMovementGenerator::Update(Unit * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spline chain movement generator with the provided unit and time
    delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the state of a spline
    chain movement generator, typically used in AI pathfinding and movement logic
    for creatures or units in World of Warcraft. It processes the current movement
    state, updates positions based on spline interpolation, and determines whether
    the movement has completed. The method takes a Unit pointer to update and an integer
    time delta representing milliseconds since last update. This function is critical
    for smooth and accurate NPC movement along predefined paths.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement state needs to be updated.
      This represents the entity (creature, player, etc.) that is following the spline
      chain path.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer value representing the time delta in milliseconds since the
      last update call. Used to calculate proper movement progression along the spline
      path.
  returns: Returns true if the movement is still in progress or has completed successfully,
    false if there was an error during the update process or if the movement should
    be stopped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator\
      \ && m_movementGenerator->GetMovementType() == MOVEMENT_TYPE_SPLINE_CHAIN)\n\
      \    {\n        if (!m_movementGenerator->Update(me, diff))\n        {\n   \
      \         // Movement completed or failed\n            m_movementGenerator =\
      \ nullptr;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom movement logic
    code: "bool SplineChainMovementGenerator::Update(Unit* unit, int32 diff)\n{\n\
      \    if (!unit || !unit->IsInWorld())\n        return false;\n\n    // Update\
      \ spline progress\n    if (m_spline->Finalized())\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ movement completion\n        return false; // Movement finished\n    }\n\n\
      \    // Process time-based movement update\n    m_elapsed += diff;\n    if (m_elapsed\
      \ >= m_updateInterval)\n    {\n        m_elapsed = 0;\n        unit->UpdatePosition();\n\
      \    }\n\n    return true; // Continue moving\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the AI update loop or movement system.
    The time delta parameter should be carefully managed to ensure consistent movement
    speed regardless of frame rate. The spline chain movement generator assumes that
    it has been properly initialized with a valid spline path before calling Update.
  warnings: Do not call Update on a movement generator that hasn't been initialized
    with a valid spline path, as this may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    the Unit pointer passed is valid and in world before calling this method.
