  method: HasConditionsForSpellClickEvent
  signature: bool ConditionMgr::HasConditionsForSpellClickEvent(uint32 creatureId,
    uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if conditions exist for a spell click event involving a specific creature
    and spell.
  description: The HasConditionsForSpellClickEvent method determines whether there
    are any conditional requirements defined in the database for a given creature
    ID and spell ID combination related to a spell click event. Spell click events
    occur when a player interacts with a creature using a spell, typically triggering
    an action such as quest acceptance or item delivery. This method is used internally
    by the ConditionMgr to validate if additional conditions (such as player faction,
    quest status, or item requirements) must be met before allowing the spell click
    interaction to proceed. It does not evaluate the actual conditions but only checks
    their existence in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureId
    description: The unique identifier of the creature involved in the spell click
      event.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being used to interact with the
      creature.
  returns: Returns true if conditions exist for the specified creature and spell combination;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for spell click conditions
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->HasConditionsForSpellClickEvent(12345, 67890)) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with additional condition evaluation\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Conditions found for creature 12345 and spell 67890\");\n} else {\n    // No\
      \ conditions defined, proceed normally\n    sLog->outString(\"No conditions\
      \ found for creature 12345 and spell 67890\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the ConditionMgr's internal database lookup mechanism.
    It is typically called before evaluating actual conditions to avoid unnecessary
    processing if no conditions are defined for a given creature-spell pair. The method
    does not perform any runtime condition evaluation; it only checks for the presence
    of relevant entries in the conditions table.
