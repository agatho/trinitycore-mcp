documentation:
  brief: Sets the zone music for a specified zone ID.
  description: This method configures the musical background for a specific zone within
    the game world. It allows developers to assign a particular music ID to a zone,
    which controls the audio environment when players enter that area. The method
    is typically used during map initialization or zone-specific configuration to
    ensure proper audio ambiance. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    immersive gameplay experiences and can be used in conjunction with other zone-related
    methods.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier for the zone that requires music configuration.
      This value corresponds to a specific zone in the game world, typically defined
      by the zone's ID in the database.
  - name: musicId
    description: The music ID that will be assigned to the specified zone. This represents
      the audio track or background music that players will hear when entering the
      zone. Valid values are typically defined by the game's music system and may
      include different music IDs for different zones.

  notes: This method is typically called during map initialization or zone configuration
    to ensure proper audio setup. It should be used carefully as it affects the game's
    audio environment and may impact player experience if misconfigured.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect audio settings, potentially
    causing players to hear wrong music or no music at all when entering zones. Ensure
    that zoneId and musicId values are valid before calling this method.
