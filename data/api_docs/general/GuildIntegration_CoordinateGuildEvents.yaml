  class: GuildIntegration
  method: CoordinateGuildEvents
  signature: void GuildIntegration::CoordinateGuildEvents(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates guild-related events and activities for a specified player.
  description: The CoordinateGuildEvents method manages and synchronizes various guild-related
    activities and events for a given player. This includes handling guild invitations,
    event notifications, member status updates, and coordinating participation in
    guild activities such as raids, dungeons, or social events. The method ensures
    that the player's guild information is up-to-date and that they receive appropriate
    notifications regarding guild-related actions. It typically operates within the
    context of TrinityCore's guild management system and may interact with the player's
    guild membership data, event schedules, and communication channels.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or index within the game's internal systems. This parameter is used to identify
      which specific player's guild events should be coordinated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CoordinateGuildEvents(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Object
    code: 'Player* playerObj = ...; // Assume player object is obtained

      int* playerId = &playerObj->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CoordinateGuildEvents(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's internal guild subsystem
    and may require the player to be properly initialized within the game world. It
    might also trigger database updates or send packets to clients to synchronize
    guild information.
  warnings: The method expects a valid pointer to an integer representing a player
    ID. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that the player ID corresponds to an active player in the game world before
    calling this method.
