  class: DestructionWarlockRefactored
  method: EnsurePetActive
  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::EnsurePetActive()
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the warlock's pet is active and ready for use in combat.
  description: The EnsurePetActive method checks whether the destruction warlock's
    summoned pet is currently active and valid. If the pet is not active or has been
    dismissed, this method will attempt to summon or reactivate it. This is typically
    called during spell casting or combat situations to ensure the pet is available
    for support abilities, damage output, or control effects. The method handles internal
    state management for the pet's lifecycle and ensures proper synchronization with
    the warlock's current combat status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void DestructionWarlockRefactored::CastShadowBolt()\n{\n    EnsurePetActive();\n\
      \    // Proceed with casting Shadow Bolt\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pet Management System
    code: "void DestructionWarlockRefactored::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    EnsurePetActive();\n\
      \    if (pet && pet->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Pet is ready for combat\n\
      \        pet->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any action that requires the pet to be
    present and functional. It internally manages pet summoning state transitions
    and may trigger additional events or callbacks related to pet activation. The
    implementation assumes that the warlock has the necessary resources (such as soul
    shards) to summon or maintain the pet.
  warnings: This method does not handle error cases where pet summoning fails due
    to resource constraints or game restrictions. It is recommended to check pet availability
    before calling this method if strict validation is required. Calling this method
    in rapid succession without proper cooldowns may cause unexpected behavior.
