documentation:
  brief: Removes the pet from the game world, making it no longer visible to players
    and stopping its updates.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes a pet from the active game world
    environment. This function is typically called when a pet needs to be dismissed,
    released, or destroyed. The pet will no longer be visible to players, its AI will
    stop updating, and it will be removed from the world's object manager. This method
    does not delete the pet object from memory; instead, it unregisters it from the
    world system. It is commonly used in conjunction with pet release mechanics, pet
    death handling, or when transitioning pets between different game states such
    as during player logout or zone changes.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic pet removal
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->RemoveFromWorld();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing pet during death handling
    code: "void Pet::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // Perform death animations and cleanup\n\
      \    RemoveFromWorld();\n    // Additional cleanup code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the pet is in a valid state for removal.
    It's typically invoked by the pet's owner or game systems managing pet lifecycle.
    The method does not immediately destroy the pet object; it just removes it from
    the world context. If you need to completely delete the pet, you should call RemoveFromWorld()
    followed by a deletion mechanism.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld() on an already removed pet can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the pet is in a valid state before calling
    this method. This function modifies the pet's world state and should not be called
    from within other methods that might be modifying the same pet object concurrently.
