  signature: const std::string & DB2StorageBase::GetFileName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the file name associated with the DB2 storage instance
  description: The GetFileName method retrieves the name of the DB2 file that this
    storage instance represents. This is typically used for debugging, logging, or
    identifying which data source a particular storage object is loaded from. The
    returned string is a constant reference to an internal member variable, ensuring
    no copying occurs during access. In the context of TrinityCore's database system,
    DB2 files contain structured game data such as item templates, creature information,
    and other static game assets that are loaded at startup or dynamically during
    runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the file name of the DB2
    storage. The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized
    storage objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve DB2 file name
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* storage = GetDB2Storage("Item.db2");

      const std::string& fileName = storage->GetFileName();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Loaded DB2 file: %s", fileName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using file name for error reporting
    code: "if (!storage->Load()) {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Failed\
      \ to load DB2 storage from file: %s\", storage->GetFileName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the DB2StorageBase
    object exists. This method is thread-safe and can be called concurrently from
    multiple threads without synchronization.
