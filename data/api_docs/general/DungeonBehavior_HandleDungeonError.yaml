    & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles dungeon error conditions for a group by processing and reporting
    errors.
  description: The HandleDungeonError method is responsible for managing and responding
    to various dungeon-related errors that occur within a group context. It processes
    the provided error message and takes appropriate actions such as notifying group
    members, logging the error, or triggering cleanup procedures. This method ensures
    proper error handling during dungeon encounters, maintaining game stability and
    providing meaningful feedback to players. The method operates on a Group object
    which represents the party or raid that encountered the error, allowing for targeted
    error responses.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group encountering the
      dungeon error. Must not be null.
  - name: error
    description: String containing the error message describing what went wrong during
      the dungeon encounter. Should be descriptive and localized for player clarity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      Group* group = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);

      dungeonBehavior.HandleDungeonError(group, "Instance failed to load");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling with Dynamic Message
    code: "void DungeonManager::OnDungeonFailure(Player* player, uint32 instanceId)\
      \ {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group) {\n        std::string\
      \ errorMsg = \"Dungeon failed: Instance \";\n        errorMsg += std::to_string(instanceId);\n\
      \        errorMsg += \" could not be initialized\";\n        dungeonBehavior.HandleDungeonError(group,\
      \ errorMsg);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's communication system to notify
    all members of the error. It may also trigger database logging or cleanup procedures
    for failed dungeon instances. The implementation should be thread-safe as dungeon
    operations can occur in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The error message string
    should be properly formatted and localized for end users.
