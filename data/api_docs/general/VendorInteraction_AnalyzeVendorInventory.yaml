  class: VendorInteraction
  method: AnalyzeVendorInventory
  signature: int VendorInteraction::AnalyzeVendorInventory(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a vendor's inventory and returns the count of items available for
    purchase.
  description: The AnalyzeVendorInventory method evaluates the inventory of a specified
    vendor creature and determines how many items are currently available for purchase
    by a given player bot. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior
    to make informed decisions about what items to buy or sell. It checks the vendor's
    item list, verifies item availability, and returns a count of purchasable items.
    The method may also consider factors such as vendor reputation, player faction,
    and item restrictions when determining inventory accessibility.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the vendor.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor whose inventory
      is being analyzed.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of items currently available
    for purchase from the vendor. A return value of 0 indicates no items are available,
    while positive values indicate the count of available items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int itemCount = vendorInteraction.AnalyzeVendorInventory(playerBot, npcVendor);\n\
      if (itemCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with purchasing items\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Analysis for Bot Decision Making
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nint availableItems = vendorInteraction.AnalyzeVendorInventory(bot,\
      \ vendor);\nif (availableItems >= 10) {\n    // Vendor has a substantial inventory\n\
      \    bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Vendor has many items\");\n\
      } else if (availableItems == 0) {\n    // No items available - consider alternative\
      \ vendors\n    bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"No items available\
      \ at this vendor\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally accesses the vendor's item database and may perform
    multiple lookups to determine item availability. It is recommended to cache results
    when analyzing vendors frequently to avoid performance degradation. The method
    assumes that both the bot and vendor are valid objects and will not handle null
    pointer exceptions gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and vendor parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid pointers may cause undefined behavior. This method does
    not account for temporary vendor inventory changes during runtime; results should
    be refreshed if vendor stock is expected to change frequently.
