  brief: Returns the conditional quest completion log identifier for the current quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier associated with the conditional
    quest completion log, which is used to track and manage quest completion states
    in World of Warcraft. The returned value represents the specific log entry that
    corresponds to the quest's completion conditions, allowing developers to properly
    handle quest advancement and completion logic within TrinityCore's framework.
    This method is particularly useful for quests that have conditional requirements
    or special completion criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the integer identifier of the conditional quest completion log,
    which uniquely identifies the quest completion state in the game's quest system.
    The value represents a specific log entry that tracks the quest's conditional
    completion status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int completionLogId = quest->GetConditionalQuestCompletionLog();\nif (completionLogId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Handle conditional quest completion\n    // This represents\
      \ the specific log entry for quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to properly track quest completion states. The returned value should be used carefully
    as it may affect quest progression logic and should not be modified directly.
  warnings: This method should not be called during quest initialization or when the
    quest object is not fully initialized, as it may return invalid values or cause
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the quest object is properly loaded before calling
    this method.
