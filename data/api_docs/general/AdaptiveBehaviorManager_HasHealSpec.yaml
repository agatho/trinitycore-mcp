  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::HasHealSpec() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager has a healing specialization
    assigned.
  description: The HasHealSpec method checks if the current adaptive behavior manager
    instance is configured with a healing role or specialization. This functionality
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes for NPCs or player characters
    to determine appropriate actions based on their designated role within the game's
    combat system. The method returns true if the manager has been initialized with
    a healing spec, and false otherwise. It does not modify any internal state and
    serves purely as a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the adaptive behavior manager has a
    healing specialization. Returns true if a healing spec is assigned; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.HasHealSpec()) {\n    // Perform healing-related actions\n\
      \    DoHealingBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Perform non-healing actions\n  \
      \  DoCombatBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other adaptive behavior
    management functions to dynamically adjust NPC behavior based on role assignments.
    It's important to note that the result of this method may change if the manager's
    specialization is modified externally.
