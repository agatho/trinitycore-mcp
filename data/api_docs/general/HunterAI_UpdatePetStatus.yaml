documentation:
  brief: Updates the status and behavior of the hunter's pet based on current game
    conditions and AI logic.
  description: The UpdatePetStatus method is responsible for managing the current
    state and actions of a hunter's pet within the TrinityCore AI system. This method
    evaluates various factors such as target availability, pet health, distance from
    the hunter, and combat situation to determine appropriate pet behavior. It ensures
    that the pet responds dynamically to changing battlefield conditions, including
    attacking targets, following the hunter, or performing defensive actions. The
    method is typically called during the AI update cycle and integrates with the
    broader HunterAI framework to maintain optimal pet performance in both combat
    and non-combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HunterAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    UpdatePetStatus();\n\
      \    // ... other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should not be called
    directly from outside the AI framework. It relies on internal state tracking of
    pet conditions and target information. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific hunter class specialization and pet type.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper AI update context may result
    in inconsistent pet behavior or undefined states. Ensure that all necessary preconditions
    are met before invoking this method.
