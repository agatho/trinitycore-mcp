  class: Cell
  method: Cell
  signature: void Cell::Cell(float x, float y)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Cell object with specified x and y coordinates.
  description: The Cell constructor initializes a cell object using the provided x
    and y floating-point coordinates. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, cells represent grid segments of the game world used for spatial partitioning
    and efficient object management. This constructor is typically called internally
    by the core systems when creating or loading cell data structures for world processing.
    The coordinates define the cell's position within the global world grid system,
    enabling efficient lookup and management of objects within specific areas.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The x-coordinate of the cell's position in the world grid. This value
      represents the horizontal position within the game world's coordinate system.
  - name: y
    description: The y-coordinate of the cell's position in the world grid. This value
      represents the vertical position within the game world's coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cell Initialization
    code: 'Cell myCell(100.5f, 200.3f);

      // Creates a new cell at coordinates (100.5, 200.3)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Cells
    code: 'Cell cell1(0.0f, 0.0f);

      Cell cell2(533.0f, 420.0f);

      Cell cell3(-100.0f, 300.0f);

      // Initializes three cells at different world coordinates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal cell management system used by TrinityCore's
    grid-based world implementation. The actual cell size and coordinate mapping may
    vary based on server configuration and map settings. This method does not perform
    any validation on input coordinates, so invalid values may lead to unexpected
    behavior in world processing.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor for an internal class, direct usage should
    be limited to core system components. Improper coordinate values may cause issues
    with spatial queries or object management within the game world.
