  signature: float ThreatCalculator::CalculateHealingThreat(uint32 healing, float
    modifier)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates threat generated by a healing event based on healing amount and
    modifier.
  description: The CalculateHealingThreat method computes the threat value generated
    when a creature or player performs a healing action. This method is used internally
    by the threat system to determine how much threat is added to a target's threat
    list when healing occurs. The calculation takes into account both the raw healing
    amount and a modifier that can be influenced by various factors such as spell
    properties, talents, or gear effects. The resulting threat value contributes to
    the overall threat management system that controls mob targeting behavior in World
    of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: healing
    description: The amount of healing points that were applied to the target. This
      represents the raw healing value before any modifiers are applied.
  - name: modifier
    description: A multiplicative factor that modifies the threat generated by the
      healing event. This can be influenced by spell properties, talents, or other
      game mechanics that affect how much threat healing generates.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated threat generated by the
    healing event. This value is used by the threat system to update the target's
    threat list and influence mob targeting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Threat Calculation
    code: 'float threat = threatCalculator.CalculateHealingThreat(1000, 1.0f);

      // Returns threat value for 1000 healing with normal modifier'
    language: cpp
  - title: Healing Threat with Increased Modifier
    code: 'float threat = threatCalculator.CalculateHealingThreat(500, 1.5f);

      // Returns threat value for 500 healing with 1.5x modifier (e.g., from a talent)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal threat calculation system and should
    not be called directly by external code. The threat values returned are used by
    the AI and threat management systems to control mob targeting behavior. The exact
    formula for threat calculation may vary based on game patches and server configurations.
  warnings: Do not rely on specific return value ranges as they may change between
    game versions. The modifier parameter should be carefully validated as invalid
    values could lead to unexpected threat calculations that might affect gameplay
    balance.
