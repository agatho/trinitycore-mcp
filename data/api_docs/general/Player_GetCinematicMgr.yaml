  brief: Returns the cinematic manager instance associated with the player
  description: The GetCinematicMgr method retrieves the CinematicMgr object that handles
    cinematic sequences and cutscenes for the player. This manager is responsible
    for managing player-specific cinematic events, including triggering, controlling,
    and handling the playback of cinematic sequences during gameplay. It provides
    access to cinematic-related functionality such as triggering specific cinematic
    events, managing cinematic states, and coordinating with other systems that require
    cinematic data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CinematicMgr instance associated with the player.
    If no cinematic manager has been initialized or assigned, this method may return
    nullptr, indicating that no cinematic functionality is available for the current
    player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "CinematicMgr* cinematicMgr = player->GetCinematicMgr();\nif (cinematicMgr)\n\
      {\n    // Use cinematic manager\n    cinematicMgr->PlayCinematicSequence(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "CinematicMgr* cinematicMgr = player->GetCinematicMgr();\nif (cinematicMgr\
      \ && cinematicMgr->IsCinematicActive())\n{\n    // Handle cinematic events\n\
      \    cinematicMgr->HandleCinematicEvent(123);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ not in cinematic mode\n    player->SendCinematicEvent(456);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used to access cinematic functionality during gameplay.
    The CinematicMgr instance may be initialized at different points during the player's
    lifecycle, depending on whether cinematic events are triggered or if the player
    is in a cinematic state. It is important to check for null returns before using
    the returned pointer.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return nullptr if no cinematic
    manager has been initialized. Always ensure proper checks are performed before
    accessing methods or properties of the CinematicMgr instance.
