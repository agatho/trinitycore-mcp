  brief: Sets the ranged weapon attack power for the unit.
  description: This method assigns a specific attack power value to the unit's ranged
    weapon, which affects the damage output when using ranged weapons. The attack
    power directly influences the minimum and maximum damage values of ranged attacks,
    as well as the critical hit chance and other related statistics. This method is
    typically used during initialization or when modifying a unit's combat attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPower
    description: The attack power value to set for the ranged weapon. This value determines
      the base damage range and affects various combat mechanics including critical
      strike chance and hit rating.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetRangedWeaponAttackPower(100);

      // Sets the ranged weapon attack power to 100'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit has a valid ranged weapon
    equipped. The value is typically set during initialization or when modifying combat
    stats, and may require synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect damage calculations
    and potentially unbalanced gameplay. Care must be taken when setting attack power
    values, especially for player characters or NPCs with specific combat requirements.
