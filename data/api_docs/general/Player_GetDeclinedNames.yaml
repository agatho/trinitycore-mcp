documentation:
  brief: Returns the declined names array for the player
  description: This method retrieves the declined names data for the player character,
    which includes the various grammatical forms of the player's name that are used
    in game context. The returned array contains 5 integers representing the declined
    name forms for the player's name, with each element corresponding to a different
    grammatical case ( nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and locative ). This
    data is essential for proper handling of player names in various game mechanics
    such as PvP and guild chat. The method does not require any parameters and returns
    a const pointer to an array of integers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to an array of 5 integers representing the declined
    name forms for the player's name. Each integer corresponds to a grammatical case
    (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative). The values represent the
    declined name forms that are used in game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const int* declinedNames = player->GetDeclinedNames();

      int nominative = declinedNames[0];

      int genitive = declinedNames[1];

      int dative = declinedNames[2];

      int accusative = declinedNames[3];

      int locative = declinedNames[4];'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Player class and returns a const pointer to an
    array of integers. The returned array is read-only and should not be modified.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    for handling player names in game context.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's name has been properly
    set and initialized. The returned array may be NULL if the player hasn't been
    initialized with declined names data yet.
