    group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the composition of a player bot group by reorganizing members for
    better performance and role distribution.
  description: The OptimizeGroupComposition method adjusts the structure and member
    assignments within a PlayerbotGroup to enhance overall group efficiency. This
    includes redistributing roles such as tank, healer, and damage dealer among group
    members based on their capabilities and current needs. The optimization process
    considers factors like class balance, skill levels, and combat readiness to ensure
    that the group operates at peak performance during encounters. This method is
    typically invoked automatically by the bot system but can also be manually triggered
    when significant changes occur in group composition or objectives.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Optimization
    code: "PlayerbotGroup* group = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPlayerbotGroupManager()->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\n\
      if (group)\n{\n    sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPlayerbotGroupManager()->OptimizeGroupComposition(*group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group and may trigger rebalancing
    of AI behaviors. It should only be called when the group composition has changed
    significantly or when manual intervention is required for optimal performance.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or critical operations may disrupt
    ongoing activities. Ensure that group members are not engaged in time-sensitive
    tasks before invoking optimization.
