documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads phase data for all game objects and entities within
    the TrinityCore world
  description: The LoadPhases method is responsible for loading and initializing phase
    information from the database into memory. This method ensures that all game objects,
    creatures, game objects, and players are properly associated with their respective
    phases as defined in the database. It typically executes during server startup
    or when phase data needs to be refreshed. The method handles parsing phase definitions,
    creating internal phase masks, and setting up phase relationships for proper world
    interaction and visibility management. This functionality is crucial for implementing
    phased content such as instance phases, seasonal events, or area-based content
    that should only be visible under specific conditions.

  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadPhaseData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPhases();\n\
      }\n\n// Called from main server startup routine"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server initialization and should
    not be invoked repeatedly. It performs database queries to fetch phase definitions
    and may cause temporary performance overhead during execution. The method assumes
    that the database connection is already established and that phase-related tables
    contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can lead to duplicate
    phase entries or memory leaks. Ensure that database tables containing phase information
    are properly maintained and validated before calling this method. This method
    should never be called from within a multithreaded context without proper synchronization.
