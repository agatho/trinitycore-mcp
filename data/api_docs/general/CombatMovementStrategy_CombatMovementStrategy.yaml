  method: CombatMovementStrategy
  signature: void CombatMovementStrategy::CombatMovementStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CombatMovementStrategy class for managing
    AI movement during combat.
  description: The CombatMovementStrategy constructor initializes the combat movement
    behavior for AI-controlled creatures. This strategy governs how NPCs move and
    position themselves while engaged in combat, including approaches to targets,
    maintaining optimal distance, and utilizing terrain for cover. The initialization
    sets up internal state variables that control movement patterns, aggression levels,
    and tactical positioning. It prepares the AI to respond dynamically to target
    movements and environmental factors during battle sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a CombatMovementStrategy instance
    code: 'CombatMovementStrategy* strategy = new CombatMovementStrategy();

      // The strategy is now initialized and ready to be used by an AI agent

      strategy->SetTarget(unit);

      strategy->Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, so it performs default initialization
    of movement behavior. The actual combat movement logic is typically invoked through
    other methods like Update() or OnCombatStart(). This class is part of the TrinityCore's
    AI system and integrates with the creature's overall behavior tree.
