documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot is currently performing an action
  description: The IsActionInProgress method determines whether the bot AI is currently
    executing a task or action. This method is typically used to prevent overlapping
    actions or to queue new commands until the current action completes. The check
    involves examining the internal state of the bot's action queue and determining
    if any actions are actively being processed. This is particularly useful in preventing
    race conditions or conflicting behaviors when managing bot actions in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently executing an action, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the bot is idle or when no action is actively being
    processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot status
    code: "if (botAI->IsActionInProgress()) {\n    // Bot is currently performing\
      \ an action\n    // Do not queue new actions\n} else {\n    // Bot is idle,\
      \ safe to queue new actions\n    botAI->QueueAction(new MoveToAction(target));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop to wait for action completion
    code: "while (botAI->IsActionInProgress()) {\n    // Wait for current action to\
      \ complete\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      }\n// Now safe to start new action\nbotAI->QueueAction(new AttackAction(target));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks the internal state of the bot's action manager.
    It may be called frequently in game loops, so performance is important. The implementation
    likely uses atomic operations or thread-safe mechanisms to ensure accurate state
    checking across different threads.
  warnings: Calling this method while the bot is in an inconsistent state might return
    inaccurate results. Ensure that the bot AI system is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Avoid using this method in contexts where immediate action
    response is critical, as it may introduce slight delays due to internal state
    checks.
