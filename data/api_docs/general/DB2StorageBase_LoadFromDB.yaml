  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void DB2StorageBase::LoadFromDB()
documentation:
  brief: Loads database table data into memory for fast access and retrieval.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes and populates a DB2StorageBase object
    with data from the game's database. This method is typically called during server
    startup or when the storage system needs to refresh its in-memory cache. It retrieves
    records from the corresponding database table, processes them, and stores them
    in an internal data structure for efficient lookup. The method ensures that all
    required fields are properly loaded and validated before making the data available
    to other parts of the TrinityCore system. This is a critical initialization step
    for any DB2-based storage system used for game data such as item templates, creature
    entries, or spell information.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* itemStorage = new DB2StorageBase();

      itemStorage->LoadFromDB();

      // Data is now available for item lookups throughout the server'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a blocking database query operation that may impact
    server startup time. It should typically be called from a single-threaded context
    during server initialization. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and functional. Performance can be optimized by ensuring
    proper indexing on the underlying database tables.
  warnings: Calling LoadFromDB multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or duplicate data entries. This method should not be called concurrently
    from multiple threads as it may cause race conditions in the internal data structures.
