documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is visible to players in the game world
  description: The IsVisible method checks if a Unit object is currently visible within
    the game world, taking into account various visibility factors such as stealth,
    invisibility, and game state conditions. This method is essential for determining
    whether a unit can be interacted with or observed by players, particularly in
    scenarios involving player versus player combat or when dealing with hidden creatures.
    The method returns true if the unit is visible and false if it's not visible,
    making it crucial for game logic that depends on visibility status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is visible to players, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the unit can be seen or interacted with by players in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Visibility Check
    code: "if (unit->IsVisible()) {\n    // Unit is visible\n    // Perform actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Visibility with Player
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target && target->IsVisible())\
      \ {\n    // Target unit is visible to player\n    // Proceed with interaction\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against visibility conditions such as stealth,
    invisibility, and game state flags. Performance considerations include checking
    visibility status only when needed, as frequent calls may impact performance in
    high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a unit is visible to
    specific players, as visibility can vary between different players based on their
    own visibility states and conditions. Also, this method does not account for player-specific
    visibility conditions such as vision or sight.
