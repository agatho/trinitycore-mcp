  class: AzeriteItem
  method: CreateSelectedAzeriteEssences
  signature: void AzeriteItem::CreateSelectedAzeriteEssences(int specializationId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and populates the selected azerite essences for the specified
    specialization.
  description: The CreateSelectedAzeriteEssences method is responsible for setting
    up the azerite essences that are currently selected by a player for a given specialization.
    This method likely iterates through the available azerite essences, filters them
    based on the provided specialization ID, and prepares the internal data structures
    required for azerite power calculations and UI display. It's typically invoked
    when a player switches specializations or loads into a zone where azerite content
    is active. The method operates within the context of AzeriteItem class which manages
    all aspects of azerite gear and its associated powers.
  parameters:
  - name: specializationId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's current specialization. This
      ID determines which azerite essences should be considered as selected for the
      given class and spec combination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Specialization Switch
    code: "void HandleSpecializationChange(Player* player, uint32 newSpecId)\n{\n\
      \    AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();\n    if (azeriteItem)\n\
      \    {\n        azeriteItem->CreateSelectedAzeriteEssences(newSpecId);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger UI updates or recalculations of azerite power bonuses.
    It should only be called when the player's specialization has actually changed
    to avoid unnecessary processing.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the specialization ID
    may result in incorrect essence selection or undefined behavior. Ensure that the
    specialization ID corresponds to a valid class specialization before invoking
    this method.
