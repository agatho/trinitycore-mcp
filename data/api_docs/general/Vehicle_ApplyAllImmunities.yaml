  class: Vehicle
  method: ApplyAllImmunities
  signature: void Vehicle::ApplyAllImmunities()
documentation:
  brief: Applies all immunity effects to the vehicle and its passengers.
  description: The ApplyAllImmunities method ensures that the vehicle and all passengers
    aboard receive appropriate immunity effects based on the vehicle's configuration.
    This includes applying damage immunities, aura immunities, and other protective
    states that prevent harmful effects from affecting the vehicle or its occupants.
    The method is typically called during vehicle initialization or when transitioning
    between different combat states to ensure proper protection mechanisms are active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vehicle Creation
    code: "void MyVehicle::OnInstall()\n{\n    // Apply all immunities when vehicle\
      \ is installed\n    ApplyAllImmunities();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Passenger Management
    code: "void VehicleHandler::UpdateVehicleImmunities(Vehicle* vehicle)\n{\n   \
      \ if (vehicle)\n    {\n        // Ensure all passengers and vehicle have proper\
      \ immunities\n        vehicle->ApplyAllImmunities();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all passenger units and applies appropriate
    immunity auras or flags. It may be called automatically during vehicle activation,
    but explicit calls can be made to ensure immunities are properly applied after
    configuration changes.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper state management could
    result in duplicate immunity applications or unexpected behavior. Ensure the vehicle
    and its passengers are in a valid state before invoking this method.
