  brief: Sets the restriction for pings to assistants only in the party.
  description: This method handles the client request to restrict party pings to only
    assistants. When enabled, players can only send pings to other players who are
    marked as assistants in the party. This feature is typically used to reduce spam
    and improve communication efficiency during group activities such as raids or
    dungeons. The method processes the packet received from the client and updates
    the session's internal state accordingly.
