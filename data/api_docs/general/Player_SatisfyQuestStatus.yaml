documentation:
  brief: Satisfies a quest status by checking if the player has completed the quest
    requirements
  description: This method checks whether the player has met all the requirements
    necessary to satisfy a quest status. It verifies if the player has completed the
    quest's objectives, killed the required mobs, collected the required items, and
    fulfilled other conditions needed for quest completion. The method returns true
    if the quest status is satisfied, false otherwise. The optional 'msg' parameter
    controls whether a message should be sent to the player about the quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that represents the quest being checked
      for satisfaction
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether a message should be sent to the player
      about quest completion (default is true)
  returns: Returns true if the player has satisfied all quest requirements, false
    otherwise. If the quest status cannot be satisfied due to missing requirements
    or other conditions, the method returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestStatus(quest, true);\nif (result)\n{\n\
      \    // Quest is satisfied\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine to determine
    if a quest should be marked as completed. It may involve checking player's quest
    log, inventory items, and other game state conditions. Performance considerations
    include potential database calls when checking quest requirements.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with quest objects that have
    not been properly initialized or validated. Using invalid quest pointers can lead
    to crashes or undefined behavior.
