  method: Initialize
  signature: bool IBotPerformanceMonitor::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot performance monitoring system
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the IBotPerformanceMonitor
    for tracking and measuring bot performance metrics. This method typically configures
    internal data structures, initializes counters, and prepares the monitoring infrastructure
    to begin collecting performance data. It should be called once during system startup
    or when the performance monitoring needs to be activated. The method returns true
    if initialization was successful, false otherwise. This is a critical step before
    any performance measurements can be taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the performance monitor was successfully initialized and ready
    for use, false if initialization failed due to resource constraints, configuration
    errors, or other initialization issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = new BotPerformanceMonitor();\nif (monitor->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Monitoring is now active\n    printf(\"Performance monitor initialized\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to initialize performance monitor\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a performance
    monitor instance. Subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or failed
    initialization. The method may perform resource allocation and system setup that
    could impact startup time.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that any previous monitoring sessions are
    properly shut down before calling this method again.
