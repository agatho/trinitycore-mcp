documentation:
  brief: Updates the resting state of bots based on elapsed time
  description: The HandleRestingState method manages the resting behavior of bot characters
    within the TrinityCore framework. It processes the time difference (diff) to determine
    when bots should transition between resting and active states, ensuring proper
    resource management and AI behavior synchronization. This method is typically
    called during the game loop to maintain consistent bot states based on in-game
    time progression.

  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    botLifecycle.HandleRestingState(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with bot AI state machines and may affect bot
    movement, combat readiness, and resource consumption. It's important to ensure
    this method is called regularly during the game loop for proper bot behavior.
