documentation:
  brief: Updates the battle pet data for the specified GUID, synchronizing changes
    to the database and client.
  description: The UpdateBattlePetData method is responsible for synchronizing battle
    pet information associated with a given GUID between the server's memory and the
    database. This method ensures that any modifications made to a battle pet's stats,
    level, health, or other attributes are properly persisted and reflected in the
    game world. It typically gets invoked when a player's battle pet undergoes changes
    such as leveling up, gaining experience, or experiencing stat modifications during
    battles. The method handles internal data validation and triggers necessary updates
    to the client-side pet display and game state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet whose data needs to
      be updated. This value must correspond to a valid battle pet entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Battle Pet Data for Player's Pet
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetMgr();

      uint32 playerPetGuid = 12345;

      petMgr->UpdateBattlePetData(playerPetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger database I/O operations, so frequent calls could
    impact performance. It is recommended to batch updates where possible. The GUID
    parameter must be validated before calling this method to avoid potential crashes
    or data corruption.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID to this method can result in undefined
    behavior or database errors. Always ensure the GUID corresponds to a valid battle
    pet entry before invoking this function.
