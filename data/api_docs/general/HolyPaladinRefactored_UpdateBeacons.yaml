documentation:
  brief: Updates beacon positions and statuses for the Holy Paladin's beacon-related
    abilities.
  description: The UpdateBeacons method is responsible for managing the state and
    positioning of beacons cast by a Holy Paladin. This includes updating their location,
    checking for validity, and ensuring proper interaction with other game mechanics
    such as healing effects or aura tracking. The method typically handles internal
    logic related to beacon-based abilities like Beacon of Light or Beacon of Faith,
    maintaining synchronization between the beacon's position in the world and its
    associated effects on nearby allies. It may also perform cleanup operations for
    expired or invalid beacons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void UpdateBeacons(int* group)\n{\n    // Implementation would iterate\
      \ through beacon effects\n    // and update their positions or remove expired\
      \ ones\n    // This is a placeholder for the actual logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of a Paladin's AI behavior
    tree or spell effect management system. It may be called periodically during combat
    or in response to specific events such as movement or spell casting. The 'group'
    parameter might refer to a group ID or target group for beacon targeting, though
    its exact usage is speculative without source code.
  warnings: This method should not be invoked directly from outside the class unless
    absolutely necessary, as it's part of internal state management. Improper handling
    of beacon states could lead to incorrect healing application or visual artifacts
    in the game world.
