  class: LFGMgr
  method: IsVoteKickActive
  signature: bool LFGMgr::IsVoteKickActive(int gguid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a vote kick is currently active for the specified group.
  description: The IsVoteKickActive method determines whether a vote kick process
    is currently underway for a given group identified by its GUID. This functionality
    is typically used within the LFG (Looking For Group) system to prevent multiple
    simultaneous vote kick operations on the same group. The method evaluates internal
    state tracking to return a boolean result indicating the active status of any
    ongoing vote kick.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global group identifier (GUID) of the group for which to check
      if a vote kick is active. This value uniquely identifies the group within the
      TrinityCore instance.
  returns: Returns true if a vote kick is currently active for the specified group;
    otherwise, returns false. A vote kick is considered active when the system has
    initiated a voting process to remove a member from the group.
  examples:
  - title: Check Vote Kick Status
    code: "if (sLFGMgr->IsVoteKickActive(12345)) {\n    // Handle case where vote\
      \ kick is active\n    sLog->outString(\"Vote kick is currently active for group\
      \ 12345\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal operations\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No active vote kick for group 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking maintained by the LFG manager.
    It should be called only when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead. The implementation
    assumes that the group GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing group
    in the system.
