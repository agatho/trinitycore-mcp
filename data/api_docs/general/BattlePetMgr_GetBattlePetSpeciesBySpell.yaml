  method: GetBattlePetSpeciesBySpell
  signature: const BattlePetSpeciesEntry * BattlePetMgr::GetBattlePetSpeciesBySpell(int
    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battle pet species entry associated with a given spell ID.
  description: The GetBattlePetSpeciesBySpell method looks up and returns a pointer
    to the BattlePetSpeciesEntry structure that corresponds to the specified spell
    ID. This is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's battle pet system,
    where each battle pet species is linked to a specific spell that represents its
    abilities or summoning mechanism. The method performs a lookup within the internal
    battle pet data structures and returns a valid entry if found, or nullptr if no
    matching species exists for the provided spell ID. This function is essential
    for systems that need to determine pet properties based on spell associations.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell associated with a battle pet species.
      This should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: A pointer to a const BattlePetSpeciesEntry structure if a matching species
    is found for the given spell ID; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such association
    exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const BattlePetSpeciesEntry* species = battlePetMgr->GetBattlePetSpeciesBySpell(83301);\n\
      if (species)\n{\n    // Use the species data\n    std::cout << \"Found pet species:\
      \ \" << species->Name << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Pet Species
    code: "int spellId = 83301; // Example spell ID\nconst BattlePetSpeciesEntry*\
      \ entry = battlePetMgr->GetBattlePetSpeciesBySpell(spellId);\nif (entry != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process valid pet species\n    uint32_t speciesId = entry->ID;\n \
      \   std::string name = entry->Name;\n    // ... further processing\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid or unknown spell ID\n    sLog->outError(\"No battle\
      \ pet species found for spell ID %u\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that are populated during
    server startup from the game database. Ensure that the spell ID passed is valid
    and corresponds to a known battle pet spell in the database. The returned pointer
    is valid only as long as the BattlePetMgr instance remains active and the underlying
    data has not been modified.
  warnings: Do not assume that all spell IDs will have corresponding battle pet species
    entries. Always check for nullptr before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation
    faults or undefined behavior.
