documentation:
  brief: Updates the trade system state based on elapsed time
  description: The Update method processes all active trades within the TradeSystem,
    handling trade confirmations, timeouts, and state transitions. It is called periodically
    by the game loop to ensure proper trade management and synchronization. This method
    typically checks for trade agreement timeouts, validates trade items, and updates
    player states accordingly. The implementation likely handles both player-initiated
    trades and any automated trade system behaviors.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetUpdateDiff();\n    sTradeSystem->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop with the time
    difference since last update. It's important to ensure that this method doesn't
    block or perform heavy operations as it's called frequently. The implementation
    likely uses internal timers and state machines to manage trade progress.
