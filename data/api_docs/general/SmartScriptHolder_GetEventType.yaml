  class: SmartScriptHolder
  method: GetEventType
  signature: uint32 SmartScriptHolder::GetEventType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the event type identifier associated with this smart script holder.
  description: The GetEventType method returns the unique identifier representing
    the type of event that this SmartScriptHolder is configured to respond to. In
    the context of TrinityCore's AI system, smart scripts are used to define behaviors
    for creatures, game objects, and other entities based on specific events such
    as entering combat, receiving damage, or reaching a certain health percentage.
    This method allows developers to query which event type a particular script instance
    is designed to handle, enabling dynamic behavior modification or inspection of
    script logic at runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the event type identifier. The specific numeric
    values correspond to predefined event types within the SmartScript system, such
    as SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_IN_BG (10), SMART_EVENT_RECEIVE_EMOTE (11), etc., as defined
    in the SmartEnums.h header file.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nuint32\
      \ eventType = holder->GetEventType();\nif (eventType == SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_IN_BG)\n\
      {\n    // Handle logic specific to BG update events\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Type Inspection
    code: "void InspectScript(SmartScriptHolder* holder)\n{\n    uint32 eventType\
      \ = holder->GetEventType();\n    switch (eventType)\n    {\n        case SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_IN_BG:\n\
      \            printf(\"This script responds to BG update events\\n\");\n    \
      \        break;\n        case SMART_EVENT_RECEIVE_EMOTE:\n            printf(\"\
      This script responds to emote events\\n\");\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            printf(\"Unknown event type: %u\\n\", eventType);\n           \
      \ break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter function and does not perform any side effects
    or computations. It directly accesses a member variable that was set during object
    initialization or script loading. The returned value should be compared against
    constants defined in SmartEnums.h for proper event type identification.
