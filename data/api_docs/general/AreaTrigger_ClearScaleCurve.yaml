  class: AreaTrigger
  method: ClearScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ClearScaleCurve(int scaleCurveMutator)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the scale curve associated with the specified scale curve mutator
    for this area trigger.
  description: The ClearScaleCurve method removes or resets the scale curve that has
    been applied to an AreaTrigger instance using a specific scale curve mutator.
    This is typically used in conjunction with area trigger effects that require dynamic
    scaling behavior, such as visual effects or collision detection changes over time.
    The method ensures that any previously set scale curve data for the given mutator
    is cleared from the area trigger's internal state. This operation does not affect
    other properties of the area trigger and is generally called when transitioning
    between different states or when cleaning up effect data.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleCurveMutator
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which scale curve mutator to
      clear. This value typically corresponds to a predefined constant or index used
      to distinguish different types of scaling behaviors applied to the area trigger.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a Scale Curve for an Area Trigger
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume we have a valid area trigger instance

      trigger->ClearScaleCurve(1); // Clears the scale curve associated with mutator
      1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing dynamic effects on
    area triggers. The internal implementation may involve clearing cached data or
    resetting state variables related to scaling behavior. It's recommended to call
    this method before applying new scale curves to avoid conflicts between old and
    new scaling data.
