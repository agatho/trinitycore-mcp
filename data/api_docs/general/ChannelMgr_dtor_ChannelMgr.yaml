documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ChannelMgr instance and cleans up all associated channel resources.
  description: The ChannelMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    channel-related data structures and releasing any allocated memory when a ChannelMgr
    object is destroyed. This includes removing all active channels from the system,
    notifying connected players of channel destruction, and ensuring no dangling references
    remain. The destructor is automatically invoked when a ChannelMgr instance goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource management and
    prevents memory leaks in the chat system's channel handling mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ChannelMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ChannelMgr* mgr = new ChannelMgr();\n    //\
      \ ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor automatically called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    system stability. It's important to ensure that all references to channels managed
    by this ChannelMgr are properly handled before destruction to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior.
