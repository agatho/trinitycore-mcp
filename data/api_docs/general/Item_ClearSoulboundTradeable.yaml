  class: Item
  method: ClearSoulboundTradeable
  signature: void Item::ClearSoulboundTradeable(Player * currentOwner)
documentation:
  brief: Removes soulbound and tradeable flags from an item, allowing it to be traded
    or destroyed.
  description: The ClearSoulboundTradeable method removes the soulbound and tradeable
    status flags from an Item object. This operation typically occurs when an item
    is being transferred between players or when certain game events require the item
    to become tradable. The method ensures that the item can no longer be bound to
    a specific player and can be freely traded or destroyed. It is commonly used during
    item modifications, auctions, or when items are being reset for reuse. This method
    does not modify the item's physical state in the database but rather updates its
    in-memory flags and associated properties.
  parameters:
  - name: currentOwner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the current owner of the
      item. This parameter is used to validate ownership and may be required for proper
      flag removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing soulbound tradeable flags on an item
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    item->ClearSoulboundTradeable(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal flags within the Item class and may trigger
    synchronization with the database or client-side updates. It should only be called
    when appropriate ownership validation has been performed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper ownership verification could lead to
    incorrect item state or potential exploits. Ensure that the currentOwner parameter
    correctly represents the actual owner of the item before invoking this method.
