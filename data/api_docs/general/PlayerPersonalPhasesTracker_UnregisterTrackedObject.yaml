documentation:
  brief: Removes a tracked WorldObject from the player's personal phases tracking
    system
  description: The UnregisterTrackedObject method removes a specified WorldObject
    from the player's personal phases tracking system. This functionality is used
    in TrinityCore's phase system to manage which objects are visible or active for
    individual players based on their current phase. When an object is unregistered,
    it will no longer be considered in phase calculations for that specific player.
    The method ensures proper cleanup of tracking references and may trigger updates
    to the player's visibility state. This is typically called when objects are destroyed,
    removed from the world, or when a player's phase changes in a way that should
    exclude the object.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject to be unregistered from tracking. Must
      not be null. The object must have been previously registered with RegisterTrackedObject()
      for this call to have any effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unregister Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* trackedObject = ...;

      player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->UnregisterTrackedObject(trackedObject);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Unregister with Null Check
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nWorldObject* trackedObject = ...;\nif (trackedObject\
      \ && player)\n{\n    player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->UnregisterTrackedObject(trackedObject);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the personal phases system which allows players to
    have different views of the world based on their current phase. The tracking system
    maintains internal references to objects and their phase relationships. Calling
    this method does not destroy the object itself, only removes it from the player's
    tracking list.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the object was previously registered before calling UnregisterTrackedObject.
    This method should not be called on objects that are already destroyed or removed
    from the world.
