  class: Object
  method: PrepareValuesUpdateBuffer
  signature: ByteBuffer & Object::PrepareValuesUpdateBuffer(UpdateData * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Prepares and returns a ByteBuffer containing the object's updated field values
    for network transmission.
  description: The PrepareValuesUpdateBuffer method constructs a data buffer that
    contains the current state of an object's update fields, formatted according to
    the World of Warcraft packet structure. This buffer is typically used when sending
    object updates to players in the game world, allowing clients to synchronize their
    local representations of the object with the server state. The method takes an
    UpdateData parameter which likely holds contextual information about the update
    process such as target players or update types. It's a core part of TrinityCore's
    object synchronization mechanism and is invoked during regular update cycles or
    when specific field changes occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to a ByteBuffer containing the serialized update data for the
    object, ready to be sent over the network as part of an update packet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in update cycle
    code: 'UpdateData data;

      ByteBuffer& buffer = myObject.PrepareValuesUpdateBuffer(&data);

      // Send buffer to players in range

      player->GetSession()->SendPacket(&buffer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the update system. Developers
    should not normally need to call it directly unless implementing custom update
    logic or debugging update behavior. The returned ByteBuffer may be reused or modified
    by subsequent calls, so any necessary data should be copied before further processing.
  warnings: Calling this method on an object that hasn't been initialized or added
    to the world may result in undefined behavior or incomplete updates. Ensure the
    object is properly registered with the world before invoking this method.
