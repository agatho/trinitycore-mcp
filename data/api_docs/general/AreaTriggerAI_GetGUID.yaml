  method: GetGUID
  signature: int AreaTriggerAI::GetGUID(int32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the area trigger associated with
    this AI instance.
  description: The GetGUID method returns the globally unique identifier for the area
    trigger that this AreaTriggerAI instance is managing. This GUID is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to uniquely identify and reference the specific area
    trigger object within the game world. The method is typically called during AI
    behavior execution to obtain the identifier for operations such as targeting,
    tracking, or interaction with other game entities. It's important to note that
    this method returns an integer representation of the GUID, which may be used in
    various game mechanics including spell targeting, quest tracking, and event handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the area
    trigger. This value is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies the
    specific area trigger instance within the TrinityCore world state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID Retrieval
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnUpdate(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        int guid = GetGUID();\n        // Use the GUID\
      \ for some operation\n        if (guid > 0)\n        {\n            // Perform\
      \ area trigger specific logic\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the state of
    the AreaTriggerAI instance. The returned GUID value should be treated as immutable
    during the lifetime of the area trigger. Implementation details suggest this method
    likely retrieves a cached or stored GUID value rather than performing expensive
    lookups.
