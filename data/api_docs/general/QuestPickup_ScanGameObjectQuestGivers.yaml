documentation:
  brief: Scans all game objects in the world to identify those that can provide quest
    givers.
  description: The ScanGameObjectQuestGivers method iterates through all active game
    objects within the TrinityCore instance and identifies those that are capable
    of initiating or offering quests to players. This function is typically invoked
    during quest system initialization or when a player's quest data needs to be refreshed.
    It checks for specific GameObject templates or flags that indicate their role
    as quest givers, such as those with quest-related scripts or entries defined in
    the game object template database. The method ensures that the quest system maintains
    an up-to-date list of available quest givers in the world.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.ScanGameObjectQuestGivers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core quest management system
    and should not typically be invoked directly by external modules unless performing
    a manual refresh of quest giver data. It may have performance implications if
    there are many active game objects in the world.
