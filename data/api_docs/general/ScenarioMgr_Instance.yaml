documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ScenarioMgr class
  description: The Instance method is a static getter that provides access to the
    global singleton instance of the ScenarioMgr class. This manager handles all scenario-related
    functionality in TrinityCore, including scenario creation, tracking, and execution.
    The method ensures thread-safe access to the singleton instance and is typically
    used to retrieve the scenario manager for performing operations such as starting
    scenarios, checking scenario states, or managing scenario-related data. The returned
    pointer is guaranteed to be valid throughout the server's runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the global ScenarioMgr singleton instance. This pointer will
    never be null during normal operation and represents the central manager for all
    scenario-related systems in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScenarioMgr* scenarioMgr = ScenarioMgr::Instance();

      // Use scenarioMgr to access scenario functionality

      scenarioMgr->StartScenario(...);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Scenario Data
    code: "ScenarioMgr* mgr = ScenarioMgr::Instance();\nif (mgr)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ operations using the scenario manager\n    mgr->UpdateScenarios();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements the singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance
    of ScenarioMgr exists throughout the application. The implementation is thread-safe
    and designed for high-frequency access during game operations. The returned instance
    is initialized during server startup and remains valid until shutdown.
  warnings: While this method returns a valid pointer, developers should ensure proper
    initialization order if accessing it very early in the server startup process.
    The singleton instance should not be manually deleted or destroyed as it's managed
    by the core system.
