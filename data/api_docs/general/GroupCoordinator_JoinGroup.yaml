documentation:
  brief: Attempts to join a player to a group managed by the GroupCoordinator.
  description: The JoinGroup method is responsible for facilitating a player's entry
    into a group within the TrinityCore framework. It typically handles the logic
    required to add a player to an existing group or create a new group if one doesn't
    exist. This method ensures proper synchronization of group membership, updates
    relevant game state, and may trigger events or notifications related to group
    changes. The operation is generally used during player login, manual group creation,
    or when players attempt to join existing groups through in-game commands or interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the group; otherwise,
    returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, group limits,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Join Usage
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (group)\n{\n    bool\
      \ success = coordinator.JoinGroup(group);\n    if (success)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      group\", \"Player successfully joined group %u\", groupId);\n    else\n    \
      \    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"group\", \"Failed to join group %u\", groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. It may perform internal checks such as verifying whether the player
    already belongs to another group, ensuring the group has available slots, and
    updating the group's member list. The method should be called from a context where
    thread safety is maintained, especially when dealing with shared group data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method without validating that the Group pointer is valid
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, attempting to join a
    player to a group that has reached its maximum capacity (typically 5 players)
    will likely result in failure and should be handled gracefully by the calling
    code.
