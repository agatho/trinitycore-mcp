  class: BotTalentManager
  method: LogTalentApplication
  signature: void BotTalentManager::LogTalentApplication(Player * bot, uint8 specId,
    uint32 talentCount)
documentation:
  brief: Logs the application of talents for a bot player, recording the spec ID and
    talent count.
  description: The LogTalentApplication method records information about talent assignments
    made to a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically
    used in conjunction with bot AI systems to track which talents have been applied
    to a specific bot's specialization. The method takes the bot player object, the
    specialization ID (specId), and the number of talents applied as parameters. It
    likely stores this information for logging, debugging, or future reference within
    the bot management system. This functionality supports the automation and tracking
    of talent builds for AI-controlled characters in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose talents are
      being logged. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID (uint8) indicating which talent tree/speciation
      is being applied. Valid values typically correspond to class-specific spec IDs
      in the game.
  - name: talentCount
    description: The total number of talents (uint32) that have been applied to the
      bot for the given specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Talent Logging Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player

      uint8 specId = 1;

      uint32 talentCount = 50;

      botTalentManager->LogTalentApplication(myBot, specId, talentCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may interface
    with database logging or debug output systems. The exact storage mechanism for
    logs is not specified but could involve internal data structures or external log
    files.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is a valid Player pointer to prevent runtime
    errors. The specId should be validated against known specialization IDs for the
    bot's class to avoid incorrect logging.
