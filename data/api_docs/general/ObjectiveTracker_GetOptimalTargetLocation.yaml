  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetOptimalTargetLocation
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::GetOptimalTargetLocation(uint32 targetId, const
    int & playerPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal location for a target based on player
    position and objective data.
  description: The GetOptimalTargetLocation method determines the best spatial coordinate
    for a given target ID relative to the player's current position. This method is
    typically used in quest tracking and objective management systems within TrinityCore
    to guide players toward objectives. It evaluates various factors such as proximity,
    terrain, and game mechanics to determine an optimal location that ensures the
    most effective pathfinding and user experience. The method requires valid target
    and player position data to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier for the target object or quest objective. Must
      be a valid ID present in the current world context.
  - name: playerPosition
    description: Reference to the player's current position, typically represented
      as an integer coordinate value. Should reflect the player's actual location
      within the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated optimal target location.
    A positive value indicates a valid coordinate, while negative values may indicate
    invalid input or no suitable location found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int optimalLocation = objectiveTracker->GetOptimalTargetLocation(12345,
      playerPosition);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error checking
    code: "int location = objectiveTracker->GetOptimalTargetLocation(targetId, playerPos);\n\
      if (location >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with navigation logic\n    printf(\"Optimal\
      \ location: %d\\n\", location);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid result\n  \
      \  printf(\"No valid optimal location found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectiveTracker system and relies on internal
    quest and objective data structures. It may perform calculations involving distance
    metrics, pathfinding algorithms, or other game-specific logic to determine optimal
    locations. The method assumes that the targetId exists in the current context
    and that playerPosition is valid.
  warnings: Ensure that both targetId and playerPosition are valid before calling
    this method. Invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should not be called during critical game states where performance
    is paramount due to its computational requirements.
