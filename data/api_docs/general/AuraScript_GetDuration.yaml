  class: AuraScript
  method: GetDuration
  signature: int AuraScript::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining duration of the aura in milliseconds
  description: The GetDuration method returns the current remaining time left on the
    aura that this AuraScript is attached to. This value represents how many milliseconds
    are left before the aura expires and is typically used for timing-based effects,
    visual feedback, or conditional logic within aura scripts. The returned value
    decreases over time as the aura progresses toward its expiration. This method
    is commonly used in custom aura behaviors where the script needs to know the current
    state of the aura's timer.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the remaining duration of the aura in milliseconds.
    Returns 0 if the aura has already expired or if the aura does not have a time-based
    duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Remaining Duration
    code: "void OnUpdate(int32 diff) override\n{\n    int32 duration = GetDuration();\n\
      \    if (duration <= 5000) // Less than 5 seconds remaining\n    {\n       \
      \ // Trigger special effect or warning\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Duration in Conditional Logic
    code: "void OnAuraApply() override\n{\n    int32 duration = GetDuration();\n \
      \   if (duration > 30000) // More than 30 seconds\n    {\n        // Apply special\
      \ handling for long-duration auras\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an AuraScript context where
    the aura is actively applied. The returned value reflects the actual remaining
    time and may be affected by effects that modify aura duration such as haste or
    reduction buffs. This method does not account for any modifications to the aura's
    timer that might occur during the script execution.
  warnings: Do not use this method outside of an active aura application context,
    as it may return invalid values or cause undefined behavior. Be aware that the
    duration value is updated in real-time and may change between calls if other systems
    modify the aura's timer.
