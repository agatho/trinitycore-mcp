  class: MageSpellCalculator
  method: CalculateFrostboltDamage
  signature: uint32 MageSpellCalculator::CalculateFrostboltDamage(Player * caster,
    ::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage output of a Frostbolt spell cast by a Mage player on
    a target unit.
  description: The CalculateFrostboltDamage method computes the total damage dealt
    by the Frostbolt spell, taking into account various factors such as the caster's
    spell power, base spell damage, target resistance, and applicable spell modifiers.
    This method is typically invoked during the execution of a Frostbolt spell to
    determine how much damage should be inflicted on the target unit. The calculation
    considers the Mage's current stats, including intellect, spell damage bonuses,
    and any relevant buffs or debuffs that may affect spell performance. It also accounts
    for the target's resistance to frost magic and applies appropriate damage mitigation
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Mage casting the Frostbolt
      spell. Must not be null and must be a valid player with Mage class.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target of the Frostbolt
      spell. Must not be null and should be a valid game unit that can take damage.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated total damage dealt by
    the Frostbolt spell. This value accounts for all relevant modifiers, resistances,
    and calculations applied during the spell's execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateFrostboltDamage
    code: 'Player* mage = ...; // Get a valid Mage player

      Unit* target = ...; // Get a valid target unit

      uint32 damage = MageSpellCalculator::CalculateFrostboltDamage(mage, target);

      // Use the calculated damage value for spell effect

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using damage calculation in spell effect application
    code: 'Player* caster = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      uint32 baseDamage = MageSpellCalculator::CalculateFrostboltDamage(caster, target);

      WorldPacket data(SMSG_SPELL_DAMAGE_SHIELD, 20);

      data << uint64(target->GetGUID());

      data << uint32(1); // Spell ID for Frostbolt

      // Apply the calculated damage to the target

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Mage spell calculation system and should only
    be called when a Frostbolt spell is actually being cast. The method assumes that
    all necessary preconditions have been met, such as valid player and target objects,
    proper spell casting state, and appropriate mana costs already deducted. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore and any custom modifications
    made to the spell system.
  warnings: Ensure both caster and target parameters are valid non-null pointers before
    calling this method. Passing invalid or null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method does not perform its own validation of spell
    casting conditions; it assumes these have already been checked by the calling
    code.
