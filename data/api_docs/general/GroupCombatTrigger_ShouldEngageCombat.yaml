  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::ShouldEngageCombat(Player * bot, Group * group)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player bot should engage in combat with nearby enemies
    based on group dynamics and combat triggers.
  description: The ShouldEngageCombat method evaluates if a player bot, within the
    context of a group, should initiate or continue combat with nearby hostile targets.
    This decision is influenced by various factors including group composition, threat
    levels, combat trigger conditions, and AI behavior settings. The method typically
    checks whether engaging in combat aligns with the group's tactical objectives
    and the bot's current role (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer). It may also consider
    the presence of other players in the group, the bot's health status, and specific
    combat rules defined by the GroupCombatTrigger configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      whether to engage combat. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the bot and potentially other
      players. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group
      context for the bot.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should engage in combat with nearby enemies, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on internal logic involving group dynamics, threat
    assessment, and combat trigger rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot should engage combat
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger->ShouldEngageCombat(playerBot, playerGroup)) {\n\
      \    // Initiate combat with nearby enemies\n    playerBot->AttackStart(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a combat decision loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateCombat() {\n    if (ShouldEngageCombat(bot, bot->GetGroup()))\
      \ {\n        // Perform combat actions\n        DoCombatActions();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Move to safe position or follow group\n        FollowGroup();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and is intended for use
    within bot AI logic. It relies on internal state tracking of the bot's group and
    combat status. The method may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    considerations are important when implementing custom logic.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'group' parameters are valid and not null before
    calling this method. Incorrect usage can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also note that the method's behavior might vary depending on the specific GroupCombatTrigger
    configuration and AI settings.
