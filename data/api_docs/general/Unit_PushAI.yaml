  brief: Pushes a new AI instance onto the unit's AI stack
  description: The PushAI method adds a new UnitAI instance to the stack of AI behaviors
    for a given unit. This method is used to manage the AI state of creatures or players,
    allowing for dynamic switching between different AI behaviors during gameplay.
    It typically involves adding an AI behavior to the unit's current AI stack, which
    can be useful for implementing complex AI logic or changing behavior dynamically
    based on game conditions.

  - title: Basic AI Push Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      UnitAI* newAI = new SimpleAI();

      target->PushAI(newAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI management methods
    like PopAI or ReplaceAI. The implementation may involve stack management and could
    potentially affect performance if used excessively.
  warnings: Improper use of PushAI can lead to memory leaks or incorrect AI behavior
    if not properly managed. Care should be taken when pushing AI instances to avoid
    duplicate or conflicting behaviors.
