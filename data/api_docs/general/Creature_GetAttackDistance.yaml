documentation:
  brief: Returns the attack distance of the creature to the player
  description: The GetAttackDistance method calculates and returns the maximum distance
    at which a creature can perform melee attacks on a player. This value represents
    the creature's attack range, determining how close a player must be to the creature
    for it to engage in combat. The method is essential for understanding creature
    AI behavior and combat mechanics within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
    It considers various factors including creature's size, player's size, and game
    mechanics related to attack range.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the maximum attack distance in yards.
    This value indicates how far away a player can be from the creature before the
    creature cannot perform melee attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float distance = creature->GetAttackDistance(player);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in creature AI scripts to determine when a
    creature should engage or disengage from combat. The value returned may vary based
    on creature's size and player's size, and it's important to note that this distance
    is calculated using the creature's model size rather than its actual physical
    dimensions.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining exact distances in combat
    situations as the actual attack range may differ due to game mechanics. Also,
    this method does not account for line of sight or other factors that might affect
    attack range in real gameplay scenarios.
