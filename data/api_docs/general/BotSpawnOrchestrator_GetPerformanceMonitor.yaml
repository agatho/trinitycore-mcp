  method: GetPerformanceMonitor
  signature: BotPerformanceMonitor * BotSpawnOrchestrator::GetPerformanceMonitor()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the performance monitor instance used for tracking bot-related
    performance metrics.
  description: The GetPerformanceMonitor method returns a pointer to the BotPerformanceMonitor
    object associated with this BotSpawnOrchestrator. This monitor is responsible
    for collecting and managing performance data related to bot spawning, AI behavior,
    and resource usage within the TrinityCore environment. The returned pointer is
    typically used by other systems or modules to access performance statistics, logging,
    or diagnostic information about bot operations. The method is marked as const,
    indicating it does not modify the state of the BotSpawnOrchestrator instance.
    This functionality is essential for developers and administrators who need to
    monitor system performance or debug bot-related issues in a World of Warcraft
    server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotPerformanceMonitor object associated with this orchestrator.
    Returns nullptr if no performance monitor has been initialized or if the instance
    is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = orchestrator->GetPerformanceMonitor();\n\
      if (monitor)\n{\n    monitor->LogPerformanceData();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Performance Metrics
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = BotCommand::GetOrchestrator();\nBotPerformanceMonitor*\
      \ perfMonitor = orchestrator->GetPerformanceMonitor();\nif (perfMonitor)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 spawnCount = perfMonitor->GetTotalSpawns();\n    float avgUpdateTime\
      \ = perfMonitor->GetAverageUpdateTime();\n    // Use metrics for logging or\
      \ debugging\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BotPerformanceMonitor pointer is managed by the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    and should not be deleted by the caller. The monitor instance may be null if performance
    tracking has been disabled or if initialization failed. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads existing state without modifying internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on a destroyed or uninitialized BotSpawnOrchestrator
    instance may return a null pointer, which should be checked before use. Accessing
    the returned monitor after the orchestrator has been destroyed could lead to undefined
    behavior.
