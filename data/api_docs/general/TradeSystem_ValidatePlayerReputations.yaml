  class: TradeSystem
  method: ValidatePlayerReputations
  signature: bool TradeSystem::ValidatePlayerReputations(const TradeSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the reputations of players involved in a trade session to ensure
    they meet required thresholds.
  description: The ValidatePlayerReputations method checks whether both players in
    a trade session have sufficient reputation levels to engage in the trade. This
    validation ensures that players cannot trade with others if their reputation is
    below the minimum threshold required for the transaction. The method examines
    each player's current reputation status against predefined criteria and returns
    true if all validations pass, or false otherwise. This function plays a crucial
    role in maintaining game balance and preventing exploits related to low-reputation
    characters performing trades.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both players in the trade session have valid reputations
    that meet the minimum requirements for trading; returns false if one or both players
    fail the reputation validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TradeSession session;\n// ... populate session with player data ...\nbool\
      \ isValid = tradeSystem.ValidatePlayerReputations(session);\nif (isValid) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with trade processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's reputation system to fetch current
    player standings. It may be called during trade initiation or before finalizing
    a trade agreement. The validation logic might consider faction-specific reputation
    thresholds.
  warnings: Ensure that the TradeSession object passed contains valid player data,
    as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior. This method should not
    be used in scenarios where reputation data is not properly initialized for players.
