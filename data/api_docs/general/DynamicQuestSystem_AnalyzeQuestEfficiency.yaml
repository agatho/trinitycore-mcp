  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: AnalyzeQuestEfficiency
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AnalyzeQuestEfficiency(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the efficiency of a quest for a specified bot character.
  description: The AnalyzeQuestEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a bot character
    completes quests by examining various performance metrics such as time taken,
    resources consumed, and quest completion rates. This method is typically used
    in automated questing systems to optimize bot behavior and improve overall questing
    efficiency. It processes data related to the specified bot's quest history and
    calculates key performance indicators that can be used for further analysis or
    decision-making within the dynamic quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character whose quest efficiency
      is to be analyzed. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Efficiency Analysis
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      questSystem.AnalyzeQuestEfficiency(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot character with the specified GUID exists
    in the system and has completed at least one quest. The analysis may involve database
    queries and could have performance implications when processing large numbers
    of bots or quests.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to a valid bot entry; otherwise,
    the method may produce undefined behavior or throw exceptions. This method should
    not be called concurrently with other methods modifying the same bot's quest data
    to avoid race conditions.
