documentation:
  brief: Sets a data element character value for the player
  description: This method allows setting a specific data element character value
    for a player, typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The
    method accepts a uint32 identifier for the data element and a variant value that
    can be either an int64 or float, enabling flexible data handling. It is commonly
    used for managing player attributes, stats, or game mechanics related to character
    data. The method does not return any value as it is void in nature.
  parameters:
  - name: dataElementId
    description: The unique identifier for the data element being set, typically representing
      a specific character attribute or stat
  - name: value
    description: The value to set for the data element, which can be either an int64
      or float depending on the context and type of data being stored
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetDataElementCharacter(1001, int64(12345));

      // Sets the data element with ID 1001 to value 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Float value example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetDataElementCharacter(1002, float(3.14f));

      // Sets the data element with ID 1002 to value 3.14'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely interacts with internal
    player data structures and may involve data validation or conversion depending
    on the specific data element being set. Performance considerations are minimal
    as it's a simple setter operation, but thread safety depends on how the underlying
    data is managed.
  warnings: The method may not be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments
    without proper synchronization. Care should be taken to ensure that the dataElementId
    corresponds to valid data elements in the system, otherwise it could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
