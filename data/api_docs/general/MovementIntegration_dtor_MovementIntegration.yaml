  signature: void MovementIntegration::~MovementIntegration()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the MovementIntegration instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MovementIntegration class is responsible for
    releasing any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of movement-related data structures,
    such as pathfinding caches, movement handlers, or any internal state tracking.
    It is automatically invoked when a MovementIntegration object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore, this destructor plays
    a critical role in maintaining memory efficiency and preventing resource leaks
    within the game's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of MovementIntegration object
    code: 'MovementIntegration* integration = new MovementIntegration();

      // ... use the integration object ...

      delete integration; // Triggers ~MovementIntegration()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during stack unwinding
    or explicit deletion. The implementation may involve cleanup of internal movement
    data structures, which could include pathfinding nodes, cached movement information,
    or references to other subsystems.
