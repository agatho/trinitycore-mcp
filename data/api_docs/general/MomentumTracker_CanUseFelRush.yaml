  class: MomentumTracker
  method: CanUseFelRush
  signature: bool MomentumTracker::CanUseFelRush() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use the Fel Rush ability based on current
    momentum state and cooldown conditions.
  description: The CanUseFelRush method evaluates if a player is eligible to cast
    the Fel Rush ability. This check typically involves verifying that the player
    has sufficient momentum, is not under any conflicting effects, and that the ability's
    cooldown period has expired. The method is commonly used in conjunction with class-specific
    mechanics for warlocks and other players who possess this ability. It ensures
    proper game balance by preventing misuse of abilities during inappropriate states
    such as being rooted or stunned.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can cast Fel Rush, false otherwise. The decision
    is based on momentum availability, cooldown status, and any active debuffs that
    would prevent usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetMomentumTracker()->CanUseFelRush()) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FEL_RUSH, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Cooldown Logic
    code: "MomentumTracker* tracker = player->GetMomentumTracker();\nif (tracker &&\
      \ tracker->CanUseFelRush()) {\n    player->AddSpellCooldown(SPELL_FEL_RUSH,\
      \ 0, 15000); // 15 second cooldown\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FEL_RUSH,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Fel Rush is not available at this\
      \ time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal momentum tracking systems and
    cooldown management. It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the MomentumTracker instance is valid before calling this
    method to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method might not
    account for all possible game states, such as temporary invulnerability effects.
