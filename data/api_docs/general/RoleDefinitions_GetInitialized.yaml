  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: GetInitialized
  signature: bool & RoleDefinitions::GetInitialized()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the initialized state flag of the role definitions
    object.
  description: The GetInitialized method provides access to the internal boolean flag
    that indicates whether the RoleDefinitions object has been properly initialized.
    This flag is typically set during object construction or explicit initialization
    calls, and it ensures that the role definitions are ready for use before any operations
    are performed on them. The method returns a reference to this boolean flag, allowing
    callers to both read its value and potentially modify it in certain contexts.
    In TrinityCore's context, this is crucial for ensuring that role-based systems
    (such as those used in raid groups or player permissions) are fully configured
    before being accessed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to a boolean flag indicating if the RoleDefinitions object
    has been initialized. True means initialization is complete and the object is
    ready for use; false indicates that initialization has not yet occurred or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Check Initialization State
    code: "RoleDefinitions roles;\nif (roles.GetInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ role-based operations\n    std::cout << \"Roles are initialized\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle uninitialized state\n    std::cout << \"Roles not yet\
      \ initialized\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor Initialization Status
    code: "RoleDefinitions* roleManager = new RoleDefinitions();\nbool& isInitialized\
      \ = roleManager->GetInitialized();\n\n// Simulate some initialization process\n\
      if (!isInitialized) {\n    // Perform initialization steps\n    roleManager->InitializeRoles();\n\
      \    isInitialized = true; // Mark as initialized\n}\n\n// Now safely use the\
      \ roles\nassert(isInitialized);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal member variable, which means
    modifications to the returned value will directly affect the object's state. This
    behavior should be carefully considered when using the returned reference for
    modification purposes. The initialization flag is typically set once during construction
    or explicit initialization and should not normally be reset unless reinitialization
    is explicitly required.
  warnings: Modifying the returned boolean reference can change the internal state
    of the RoleDefinitions object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if not
    handled carefully. This method should generally be used for reading the flag's
    value rather than modifying it directly.
