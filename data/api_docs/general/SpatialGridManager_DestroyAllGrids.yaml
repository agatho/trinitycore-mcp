  signature: void SpatialGridManager::DestroyAllGrids()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys all grid objects within the spatial grid manager, releasing their
    memory and cleaning up associated resources.
  description: The DestroyAllGrids method is responsible for completely clearing and
    destroying all grid instances managed by the SpatialGridManager. This operation
    typically occurs during server shutdown or when resetting the spatial grid system
    to free up memory and ensure no dangling references remain. The method iterates
    through all active grids, properly deallocates their memory, and ensures that
    any linked data structures are cleaned up appropriately. It is a critical utility
    for maintaining system stability and preventing memory leaks in the TrinityCore
    world server environment.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void WorldServer::Shutdown()\n{\n    sSpatialGridManager->DestroyAllGrids();\n\
      \    // Other shutdown procedures...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to destroy all grid data,
    typically during server shutdown or reset operations. It is not thread-safe and
    should be executed in a single-threaded context to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method while other threads are actively using grid data may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all grid access has been properly
    synchronized before invoking this method.
