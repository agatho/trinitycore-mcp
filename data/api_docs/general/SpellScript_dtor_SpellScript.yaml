documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpellScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The SpellScript destructor is automatically invoked when a SpellScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, references to spell data, or internal
    state managed by the SpellScript. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system,
    this destructor plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    stability during spell execution cycles. The destruction process typically involves
    releasing any held references to spell effects, cleaning up temporary data structures,
    and ensuring that no dangling pointers remain after the script is destroyed.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of SpellScript
    code: "void SomeSpellHandler()\n{\n    SpellScript* script = new SpellScript();\n\
      \    // ... perform spell scripting operations ...\n    delete script; // Destructor\
      \ automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-Allocated SpellScript Destruction
    code: "void AnotherSpellHandler()\n{\n    SpellScript script;\n    // ... use\
      \ the script ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when script goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implemented as a virtual function in the base SpellScript
    class, allowing proper polymorphic destruction of derived spell script classes.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime through custom memory allocation strategies.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects; let the
    compiler handle automatic destruction. Avoid manual deletion of SpellScript instances
    if they are managed by the core engine, as this may lead to double-free errors
    or undefined behavior.
