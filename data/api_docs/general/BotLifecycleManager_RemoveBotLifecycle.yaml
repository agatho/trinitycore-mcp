  class: BotLifecycleManager
  method: RemoveBotLifecycle
  signature: void BotLifecycleManager::RemoveBotLifecycle(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot lifecycle entry from the manager using the specified bot GUID.
  description: The RemoveBotLifecycle method is responsible for removing a specific
    bot's lifecycle data from the BotLifecycleManager. This function takes a bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) as input and performs cleanup operations to ensure that
    all associated lifecycle information is properly removed from internal tracking
    structures. The method is typically invoked when a bot is being deleted, disconnected,
    or when its lifecycle needs to be explicitly terminated. It ensures that memory
    and resources allocated for the bot's lifecycle are freed and that no dangling
    references remain in the system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose lifecycle data should
      be removed. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the system, otherwise
      the operation may have no effect or result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::Instance();

      manager->RemoveBotLifecycle(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Removal
    code: "BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::Instance();\nif (botExists)\n\
      {\n    manager->RemoveBotLifecycle(botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to
    an existing bot in the system. It is recommended to verify the existence of the
    bot before calling this method to prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior.
    The implementation likely involves internal data structure updates and resource
    cleanup.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that all bot lifecycle management
    operations are properly synchronized if used in a multi-threaded environment.
