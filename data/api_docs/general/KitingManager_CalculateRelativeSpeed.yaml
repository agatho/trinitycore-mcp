  class: KitingManager
  method: CalculateRelativeSpeed
  signature: float KitingManager::CalculateRelativeSpeed(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relative speed between the KitingManager's unit
    and a target unit for kiting mechanics.
  description: The CalculateRelativeSpeed method computes the relative speed between
    the unit managed by the KitingManager and a specified target unit. This calculation
    is essential for kiting behavior in World of Warcraft, where maintaining an optimal
    distance from an enemy while dealing damage requires understanding the speed differential
    between both units. The method likely takes into account movement speeds, acceleration,
    and other relevant factors to determine how quickly one unit can close or increase
    distance relative to another. It serves as a core component in AI decision-making
    for kiting strategies, particularly in combat scenarios where positioning is critical.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated relative speed. A positive
    value indicates the KitingManager's unit is moving faster than the target, while
    a negative value suggests the target is moving faster. Values near zero may indicate
    similar speeds or that one of the units is stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "float relativeSpeed = kitingManager->CalculateRelativeSpeed(targetUnit);\n\
      if (relativeSpeed > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Player is faster than target, safe to close\
      \ distance\n    player->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n}\nelse if (relativeSpeed\
      \ < -0.5f)\n{\n    // Target is faster, need to back away\n    player->MoveAwayFrom(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including unit movement
    speeds, acceleration, and possibly pathfinding data. It may be called frequently
    during combat AI updates, so performance is important. The implementation might
    cache certain values to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that both the KitingManager's unit and target are valid and in
    the same map before calling this method. Calling it on units that are not properly
    initialized or have been destroyed may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    calculations.
