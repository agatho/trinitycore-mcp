documentation:
  brief: Creates a new arena team with specified parameters including captain, type,
    name, and visual appearance.
  description: The Create method initializes a new arena team in the TrinityCore database.
    It assigns the provided captain GUID as the leader of the team, sets the team's
    type (such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5), and configures the team's visual appearance including
    background color, emblem style, emblem color, border style, and border color.
    The method ensures that all required data is valid before creating the team entry
    in the database. This function is typically used during arena team creation by
    players through the game interface or via game master commands.
  parameters:
  - name: captainGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become
      the captain and leader of the new arena team. Must be a valid player GUID.
  - name: type
    description: The type of arena team being created, indicating the number of players
      per side (2 for 2v2, 3 for 3v3, 5 for 5v5). Valid values are typically 2, 3,
      or 5.
  - name: teamName
    description: The name of the new arena team. Must be a non-empty string and unique
      across all arena teams in the realm.
  - name: backgroundColor
    description: The background color of the arena team's emblem, specified as a 32-bit
      ARGB value (e.g., 0xFF0000FF for blue).
  - name: emblemStyle
    description: The style or design of the team's emblem. This is an integer representing
      different predefined emblem designs available in the game.
  - name: emblemColor
    description: The color of the emblem, specified as a 32-bit ARGB value (e.g.,
      0xFFFF0000 for red).
  - name: borderStyle
    description: The border style around the emblem. This is an integer representing
      different predefined border designs.
  - name: borderColor
    description: The color of the emblem's border, specified as a 32-bit ARGB value
      (e.g., 0xFF00FF00 for green).
  returns: Returns true if the arena team was successfully created in the database
    with all parameters validated and stored. Returns false if any validation fails
    or if there was an error during the creation process, such as a duplicate team
    name or invalid GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arena Team Creation
    code: "ArenaTeam* newTeam = new ArenaTeam();\nbool success = newTeam->Create(123456,\
      \ 3, \"Thunderbolts\", 0xFF0000FF, 10, 0xFFFF0000, 5, 0xFF00FF00);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Team created successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Arena team 'Thunderbolts'\
      \ created successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to create team\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to create arena team 'Thunderbolts'.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a 2v2 Arena Team
    code: "// Example of creating a 2v2 arena team with specific visual settings\n\
      ArenaTeam* team = new ArenaTeam();\nuint8 teamType = 2; // 2v2 arena\nstd::string\
      \ teamName = \"Shadow Strikers\";\nuint32 bgColor = 0xFF800080; // Purple background\n\
      uint8 emblemStyle = 15;\nuint32 emblemColor = 0xFFFFFFFF; // White emblem\n\
      uint8 borderStyle = 3;\nuint32 borderColor = 0xFF000000; // Black border\n\n\
      bool result = team->Create(789012, teamType, teamName, bgColor, emblemStyle,\
      \ emblemColor, borderStyle, borderColor);\nif (result)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      2v2 arena team '%s' created successfully.\", teamName.c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create 2v2 arena team '%s'.\", teamName.c_str());\n\
      }"

  notes: This method performs validation on all input parameters before attempting
    to insert the new arena team into the database. The team name must be unique across
    all realms, and the captain GUID must refer to an existing player in the database.
    If any of these validations fail, the method returns false without modifying the
    database.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid or unverified data as it
    may lead to database inconsistencies. Ensure that the captainGuid refers to a
    valid online player and that all color values are properly formatted ARGB integers.
    Repeatedly calling this method with identical parameters will result in failure
    due to duplicate team name constraints.
