documentation:
  brief: Player leaves the current battleground and teleports to the nearest entry
    point.
  description: This method allows a player to exit the current battleground and return
    to the nearest entry point. It is typically used when a player wishes to leave
    a battleground before its completion or when they are no longer able to participate
    in the match. The method handles the teleportation process and ensures that the
    player's position is updated correctly within the game world. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper game flow and preventing players from remaining
    in battlegrounds indefinitely.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect the player's state
    in battlegrounds and potentially cause issues if called at inappropriate times
    during a match. The teleportation process involves updating player's coordinates
    and removing them from battleground-related systems.
  warnings: Calling this method during active battleground combat can lead to unexpected
    behavior or loss of player data. Always ensure that player is not actively engaged
    in combat before invoking this method.
