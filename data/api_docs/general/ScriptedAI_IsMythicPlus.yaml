documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current encounter is running in Mythic+ difficulty.
  description: The IsMythicPlus method checks if the ongoing dungeon encounter is
    being conducted with Mythic+ scaling enabled. This is commonly used in ScriptedAI
    implementations to adjust behavior, loot distribution, or combat mechanics based
    on the difficulty level. The method returns true when the instance is running
    in a Mythic+ context, which typically implies higher enemy scaling, additional
    objectives, and enhanced rewards compared to standard dungeon modes. It's particularly
    useful for custom AI logic that needs to differentiate between regular and Mythic+
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current encounter is running in Mythic+ difficulty;
    otherwise returns false.

    code: "class MyBossAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        if (IsMythicPlus())\n        {\n           \
      \ // Apply enhanced abilities or scaling for Mythic+\n            DoCast(me,\
      \ SPELL_ENHANCED_ABILITY);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n           \
      \ // Standard behavior\n            DoCast(me, SPELL_NORMAL_ABILITY);\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the instance's difficulty settings being properly set
    to Mythic+ mode. It should only be called during active combat or when the AI
    has access to valid instance data. The result is cached internally and does not
    require repeated calls for performance reasons.
