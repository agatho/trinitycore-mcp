documentation:
  brief: Updates the interaction manager's state and processes pending interactions.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the InteractionManager class by a specified time delta. It handles processing
    queued interactions, managing timeouts, and ensuring that all active interactions
    are properly maintained within the game world. This method is typically called
    from the main game loop at regular intervals to keep interaction states synchronized
    with the current game time. The method processes any pending events or actions
    that need to be executed based on the elapsed time since the last update.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->getWorldTickTime() - m_lastUpdateTime;\n\
      \    m_interactionManager.Update(diff);\n    m_lastUpdateTime = sWorld->getWorldTickTime();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper interaction handling. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds
    elapsed since last update, which is crucial for accurate timing of interactions.
