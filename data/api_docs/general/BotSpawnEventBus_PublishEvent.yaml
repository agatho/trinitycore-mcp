  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::PublishEvent(std::shared_ptr<BotSpawnEvent> event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a bot spawn event to all registered listeners in the event bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a BotSpawnEvent to all subscribers
    of the BotSpawnEventBus. This mechanism allows various systems within the TrinityCore
    framework to react to bot spawning activities, such as updating player interfaces,
    logging events, or triggering quest conditions. The method takes ownership of
    the event shared pointer and forwards it to all registered observers without returning
    any value. It is designed to be thread-safe and efficient for real-time game event
    handling.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A shared pointer to a BotSpawnEvent object containing details about
      the bot spawn action. The event must be valid and properly initialized before
      being published.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSpawnEvent> spawnEvent = std::make_shared<BotSpawnEvent>(playerGuid,
      botEntryId);

      bus.PublishEvent(spawnEvent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Publishing with Custom Event Data
    code: 'auto event = std::make_shared<BotSpawnEvent>(playerGuid, botEntryId);

      event->SetSpawnLocation({123.45f, 678.90f, 10.0f});

      event->SetSpawnReason(BotSpawnReason::QUEST_ACCEPTED);

      bus.PublishEvent(event);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a thread-safe observer pattern implementation that ensures
    events are delivered to all registered listeners concurrently. The shared_ptr
    parameter is consumed by the method, so the original pointer should not be used
    afterward.
  warnings: Ensure that event objects are fully initialized before publishing to avoid
    undefined behavior. Avoid publishing events from within event handlers to prevent
    potential deadlocks or infinite recursion.
