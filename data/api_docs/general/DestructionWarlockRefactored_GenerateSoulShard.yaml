  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::GenerateSoulShard(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates soul shards for a destruction warlock based on specified amount.
  description: The GenerateSoulShard method is responsible for creating and adding
    soul shards to a destruction warlock's resource pool. This method typically gets
    invoked when the warlock performs actions that generate soul shards, such as casting
    certain spells or using abilities like Soul Fire or Shadow Bolt. The generated
    shards contribute to the warlock's ability to cast powerful spells that require
    soul shard resources. This method does not directly interact with the player's
    inventory but rather manages internal resource tracking within the destruction
    warlock AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.GenerateSoulShard(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Soul Shards
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.GenerateSoulShard(3);

      // This would generate 3 soul shards for the warlock''s resource pool'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that manages warlock resource
    generation and usage. It may be called internally by other methods such as spell
    casting or ability execution. The amount parameter should be validated to ensure
    it's within acceptable bounds (e.g., positive integer).
  warnings: Ensure that the warlock instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method modifies internal
    state and does not directly interact with game objects or player data.
