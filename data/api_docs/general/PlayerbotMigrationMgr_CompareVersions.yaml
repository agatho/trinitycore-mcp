  signature: int PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CompareVersions(const std::string & version1,
    const std::string & version2)
documentation:
  brief: Compares two version strings to determine their relative ordering.
  description: The CompareVersions method performs a lexicographical comparison of
    two version strings, typically used to determine if one version is greater than,
    less than, or equal to another. This is commonly used in TrinityCore for migration
    checks between different playerbot configurations or data versions. The method
    handles standard version string formats such as '1.2.3' and returns an integer
    indicating the relationship between the two versions. It's particularly useful
    during system updates or when validating compatibility between different bot configuration
    versions.
  parameters:
  - name: version1
    description: First version string to compare, typically in format like '1.2.3'
      or '2.0.0'
  - name: version2
    description: Second version string to compare, typically in format like '1.2.3'
      or '2.0.0'
  returns: 'Returns an integer value: 0 if versions are equal, negative if version1
    is less than version2, positive if version1 is greater than version2. The comparison
    follows standard lexicographical ordering rules for version strings.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Version Comparison
    code: 'int result = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CompareVersions("1.2.3", "1.2.4");

      // Returns negative value indicating version1 < version2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Version Equality Check
    code: "int result = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CompareVersions(\"2.0.0\", \"2.0.0\"\
      );\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Versions are identical\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes standard version string formats and may not handle all
    edge cases like pre-release identifiers or build metadata. It's designed for simple
    numeric version comparisons rather than complex semantic versioning schemes.
