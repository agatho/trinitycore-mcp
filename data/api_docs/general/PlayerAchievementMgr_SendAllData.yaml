  class: PlayerAchievementMgr
  method: SendAllData
  signature: void PlayerAchievementMgr::SendAllData(const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all achievement data for the player to the specified receiver.
  description: The SendAllData method is responsible for transmitting the complete
    set of achievement information associated with a Player to another Player or client.
    This method typically sends data related to completed achievements, progress toward
    achievements, and any related metadata that defines a player's achievement status
    within the game. It is commonly used during player login, when requesting achievement
    data, or when synchronizing achievement states between different systems or clients.
    The method ensures that all relevant achievement information is properly formatted
    and sent over the network to maintain consistency in the player's achievement
    progress across the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the achievement
      data. This parameter specifies which client or player instance should be updated
      with the current achievement information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Achievement Data to a Player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get reference to target player

      PlayerAchievementMgr* achievementMgr = player->GetAchievementMgr();

      achievementMgr->SendAllData(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves serialization of achievement data into network
    packets and may trigger additional updates or notifications to the receiving client.
    It should only be called when the receiver is a valid player instance that can
    receive this information.
  warnings: Ensure that the receiver parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could result in undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method may have performance implications if called frequently or on large achievement
    sets.
