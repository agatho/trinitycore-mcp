  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: InvalidateCache
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::InvalidateCache(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates the cache for a specified zone to force recalculation of bot
    population data.
  description: The InvalidateCache method clears cached bot population data for the
    given zone ID, ensuring that subsequent requests will trigger a fresh calculation
    or retrieval of bot spawn information. This is typically used when changes occur
    in the zone's environment or configuration that would affect how bots are distributed
    or spawned. The method does not return any value and operates directly on internal
    caching structures within the BotPopulationManager class. It is commonly invoked
    after zone modifications, map updates, or during server maintenance to ensure
    data consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which the cache should be invalidated.
      This corresponds to the Zone ID used internally by TrinityCore's map and area
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating Cache for a Specific Zone
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->InvalidateCache(1234); // Invalidates cache for zone ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Response to Zone Update Event
    code: "void OnZoneUpdate(uint32 zoneId)\n{\n    BotPopulationManager* manager\
      \ = BotPopulationManager::Instance();\n    manager->InvalidateCache(zoneId);\n\
      \    // Additional logic to handle updated zone data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects internal caching behavior and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections. It may cause temporary delays if the
    cache is subsequently rebuilt, especially for large zones with many bots. The
    invalidation process is not thread-safe and should ideally be called from a single-threaded
    context or synchronized appropriately.
  warnings: Calling InvalidateCache repeatedly without proper throttling can lead
    to excessive recalculations and potential performance degradation. Ensure that
    this method is only invoked when necessary, such as after significant zone modifications
    or during controlled maintenance windows.
