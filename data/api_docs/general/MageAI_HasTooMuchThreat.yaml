  class: MageAI
  method: HasTooMuchThreat
  signature: bool MageAI::HasTooMuchThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Mage AI has accumulated excessive threat levels that
    may cause aggro issues.
  description: The HasTooMuchThreat method evaluates the current threat level of the
    Mage AI unit against predefined thresholds to determine if it poses a risk of
    drawing unwanted attention from enemies. This function is crucial for maintaining
    proper spellcasting behavior and preventing the mage from accidentally provoking
    hostile mobs when using high-damage spells or abilities. The method typically
    checks against internal threat tracking mechanisms and returns true if the threat
    level exceeds safe limits, allowing the AI to adjust its behavior accordingly.
    This functionality ensures that mages maintain optimal positioning and avoid unintended
    combat engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI's current threat level is considered too high,
    potentially causing aggro issues; otherwise returns false when threat levels are
    within acceptable bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Check
    code: "if (mageAI->HasTooMuchThreat()) {\n    // Switch to defensive mode or move\
      \ away from enemies\n    mageAI->DoFlee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "if (!mageAI->HasTooMuchThreat() && mageAI->GetMana() > 50) {\n    // Safe\
      \ to cast damaging spells\n    mageAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Avoid casting dangerous spells when threat is high\n    mageAI->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal threat tracking systems and may be influenced
    by factors such as spell damage output, current target aggro, and proximity to
    hostile units. The exact threshold values for 'too much' threat are implementation-specific
    and may vary based on game balance settings or difficulty levels.
  warnings: Do not use this method in isolation for combat decisions; always consider
    other AI states and conditions. Relying solely on threat level without checking
    target status or positioning can lead to suboptimal behavior.
