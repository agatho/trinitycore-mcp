documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AuraScript instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in aura application logic.
  description: The AuraScript constructor initializes a new instance of the AuraScript
    class, setting up internal state variables and preparing the script for integration
    with TrinityCore's aura system. This method is automatically called when creating
    a new aura script object and ensures that all necessary member variables are properly
    initialized before the script can be used in aura application, removal, or update
    events. The constructor typically sets up default values for various script parameters
    and prepares the object to handle aura-specific callbacks such as OnApply, OnRemove,
    and OnUpdate. It is important to note that this constructor should not be called
    directly by user code; instead, it is invoked automatically when the aura script
    is registered with the aura system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic AuraScript Registration
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void AuraScript()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Constructor logic here\n    }\n};\n\n// This constructor\
      \ is automatically called when registering the aura script\n// with the aura\
      \ system, not manually by user code"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AuraScript constructor should never be called directly by developers.
    It's an internal mechanism that's invoked automatically during aura script registration.
    Developers should focus on implementing virtual methods like OnApply(), OnRemove(),
    and OnUpdate() rather than worrying about the constructor itself.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually instantiate or call this constructor in your
    code, as it's part of the internal framework mechanics. Incorrect usage can lead
    to undefined behavior or memory corruption in the aura system.
