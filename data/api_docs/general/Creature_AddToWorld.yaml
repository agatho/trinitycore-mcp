documentation:
  brief: Adds the creature to the world update queue, making it visible to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for inserting a Creature object
    into the WorldObject update system, ensuring that the creature becomes visible
    to players in the game world. This method typically occurs during creature spawn
    or initialization, and it triggers the necessary updates to make the creature
    appear in the player's client view. The method handles the proper placement of
    the creature within the global world update list, which is essential for maintaining
    synchronization between server and client. It also ensures that the creature's
    movement and state information are properly communicated to players through the
    update system.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the creature has been properly initialized
    and its data has been set. It's important to ensure that the creature is added
    to the world only once, as repeated calls may cause issues with update system
    management. The method typically involves setting up proper visibility flags and
    ensuring that the creature's position is correctly registered in the WorldObject
    manager.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld multiple times on the same creature can lead to duplicate
    entries in the update system and potential memory leaks or synchronization issues.
    It is crucial to ensure that this method is only called once per creature instance.
