  class: BalanceDoTTracker
  method: ApplyDoT
  signature: void BalanceDoTTracker::ApplyDoT(int guid, uint32 spellId, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Damage over Time (DoT) effect to a target with specified spell
    ID and duration.
  description: The ApplyDoT method is used to initiate or apply a Damage over Time
    effect on a target within the TrinityCore framework. This method takes a unique
    identifier for the target, a spell ID representing the DoT spell being applied,
    and a duration in milliseconds. It typically integrates with the game's combat
    system to manage ongoing damage effects that tick over time. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal state related to active DoT effects on
    the specified target.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply the DoT
      effect to. This is typically a player or creature GUID.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID that defines which DoT effect to apply. This should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the database with a damage-over-time component.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration of the DoT effect in milliseconds. Determines how long
      the damage will be applied over time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DoT Application
    code: 'BalanceDoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyDoT(12345, 123456, 6000);

      // Applies a DoT with spell ID 123456 to target with GUID 12345 for 6 seconds.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Multiple DoTs
    code: 'BalanceDoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyDoT(12345, 123456, 6000);

      tracker.ApplyDoT(12345, 123457, 8000);

      // Applies two different DoTs to the same target with different durations.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal tracking systems for active DoT
    effects and may be called from spell effect handlers or AI logic. It assumes that
    the target exists and is valid within the game world context. The implementation
    may involve checks for existing DoTs of the same type to prevent stacking or overwrite
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual unit in the world,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also verify that the spellId references
    a valid DoT spell in the database; invalid IDs could lead to silent failures or
    crashes.
