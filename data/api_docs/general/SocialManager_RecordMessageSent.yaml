documentation:
  brief: Records a message sent event in the social manager for tracking chat activity.
  description: The RecordMessageSent method logs a chat message transmission within
    the SocialManager class. This function is typically invoked when a player sends
    a message through any chat channel (such as say, yell, whisper, or guild chat).
    It updates internal tracking mechanisms to monitor player communication patterns
    and may be used for anti-spam systems, chat logging, or social behavior analysis.
    The method takes a ChatType parameter that specifies the type of chat channel
    used for the message.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->RecordMessageSent(CHAT_TYPE_SAY);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or logs for each chat type.
    It may be called automatically by the core when a message is sent, and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom social behavior tracking.
