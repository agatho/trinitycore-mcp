  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: ExecuteStealthOpener
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::ExecuteStealthOpener(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a stealth-based opener sequence for an assassination rogue, initiating
    combat with a hidden attack.
  description: The ExecuteStealthOpener method performs the initial stealth-based
    combat sequence for an Assassination Rogue class. This function typically involves
    activating stealth, positioning the rogue for optimal damage output, and executing
    a high-damage ability such as Ambush or Garrote to initiate combat while maintaining
    the element of surprise. The method assumes that the rogue is already in a position
    where stealth can be successfully activated and that the target is within appropriate
    range. It may also handle state transitions between stealth and active combat
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that the rogue will initiate combat
      with. The target must be valid and within attack range for the opener sequence
      to execute properly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ExecuteStealthOpener
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogue;

      Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      rogue.ExecuteStealthOpener(&target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the rogue is in a valid stealth state
    and has line of sight to the target. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific rogue build or class specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as it could lead to undefined behavior. Also, calling this method outside of combat
    context may result in unexpected actions or failure to execute properly.
