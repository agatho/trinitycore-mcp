  brief: Calculates the variance of a set of floating-point values.
  description: The CalculateVariance method computes the statistical variance of a
    provided vector of floating-point numbers. Variance measures how far each number
    in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set. This
    method is typically used in analytics to understand data distribution and variability
    within learning or performance metrics. The calculation follows the standard formula
    for population variance, where the sum of squared differences from the mean is
    divided by the total count of values. No preconditions are required for the input
    vector, though an empty vector will result in a return value of zero.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float representing the calculated variance of the input values.
    If the input vector is empty, it returns 0.0f. A higher variance indicates greater
    spread in the data set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Variance Calculation
    code: 'std::vector<float> scores = {85.0f, 90.0f, 78.0f, 92.0f, 88.0f};

      float variance = analytics.CalculateVariance(scores);

      // Variance will be calculated based on these scores'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Empty Vector
    code: 'std::vector<float> empty_scores;

      float variance = analytics.CalculateVariance(empty_scores);

      // Returns 0.0f as there are no values to compute variance from'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the population variance formula (dividing by N) rather than
    sample variance (dividing by N-1). It assumes that all input values are valid
    floating-point numbers and does not perform any validation on the input data.
    For large datasets, consider memory usage implications when storing vectors of
    floats.
  warnings: Passing a vector with a single element will result in a variance of zero
    due to mathematical definition (no deviation from mean). Be cautious when interpreting
    results with very small or zero variance as it may indicate lack of meaningful
    variation in the dataset.
