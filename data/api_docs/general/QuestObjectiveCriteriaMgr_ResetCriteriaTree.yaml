  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: ResetCriteriaTree
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::ResetCriteriaTree(const int * questObjective)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the criteria tree for a specified quest objective, clearing all progress
    and resetting associated counters.
  description: The ResetCriteriaTree method is responsible for resetting the internal
    criteria tracking structure associated with a specific quest objective. This function
    clears any accumulated progress, resets counters, and ensures that the quest objective
    can be restarted from scratch. It is typically invoked when a quest is reset,
    failed, or re-initiated by the player. The method operates on a single quest objective
    identified by its unique identifier passed through the questObjective parameter.
    This operation affects only the specified quest objective's criteria state and
    does not influence other quest objectives or global quest progress.
  parameters:
  - name: questObjective
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the
      quest objective to reset. This value corresponds to a specific quest objective
      within the game's quest system and must be a valid identifier for the method
      to function correctly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a Specific Quest Objective
    code: 'QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* mgr = sObjectMgr->GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();

      int objectiveId = 12345;

      mgr->ResetCriteriaTree(&objectiveId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore quest system
    when a player fails or resets a quest. It should not be invoked directly unless
    implementing custom quest logic or debugging. The function assumes that the provided
    quest objective ID is valid and corresponds to an existing quest objective in
    the database.
  warnings: Invoking this method with an invalid or non-existent quest objective ID
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the quest objective
    identifier passed to this method is valid before calling it.
