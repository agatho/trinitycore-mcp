  method: GetGossipOptionSender
  signature: uint32 PlayerMenu::GetGossipOptionSender(uint32 selection) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the sender identifier associated with a selected gossip option.
  description: The GetGossipOptionSender method retrieves the unique sender identifier
    (typically a GUID) that was assigned to a specific gossip option when it was added
    to the player's gossip menu. This identifier is used by the game server to determine
    which action should be executed when a player selects a particular gossip option.
    The method operates on the currently active gossip menu and returns the sender
    value for the specified selection index. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    gossip menu handling systems where different options need to trigger distinct
    actions or dialogues.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the sender identifier associated with
    the selected gossip option. This value typically corresponds to a GUID or unique
    identifier that identifies the source of the gossip option, such as a creature,
    game object, or quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in gossip handler
    code: "void Player::OnGossipSelect(Player* player, uint32 sender, uint32 action)\n\
      {\n    if (sender == player->GetGossipMenu().GetGossipOptionSender(0))\n   \
      \ {\n        // Handle first gossip option\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->ClearMenus();\n\
      \        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(1001, player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of gossip menu handling.
    The selection parameter corresponds to the index of the selected gossip option
    (0-based). It's important to ensure that the gossip menu has been properly initialized
    before calling this method, otherwise it may return invalid data or cause undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid active gossip menu can lead to incorrect
    results. Always verify that the player is in a valid gossip interaction state
    before retrieving sender values. Additionally, be aware that different gossip
    options may share the same sender value if they originate from the same source
    entity.
