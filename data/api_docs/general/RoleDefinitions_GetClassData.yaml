documentation:
  brief: Retrieves class-specific data for a given class identifier from the role
    definitions system.
  description: The GetClassData method retrieves the ClassData structure associated
    with a specified class ID. This method is typically used within TrinityCore's
    role and class management systems to access predefined attributes, stats, or behaviors
    tied to specific player classes. The returned reference provides read-only access
    to class-specific configuration data. The method assumes that valid class IDs
    are provided and that the internal data structures have been properly initialized.
    It does not perform any validation on the input classId parameter, so callers
    should ensure the ID is within expected bounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a ClassData object corresponding to the specified
    class ID. This allows for efficient access without copying the data structure
    while ensuring that modifications cannot be made through this interface.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Class Data for Warrior
    code: 'const ClassData& warriorData = RoleDefinitions::GetClassData(1); // Class
      ID 1 represents Warrior

      uint32 baseHealth = warriorData.baseHealth;

      uint32 primaryStat = warriorData.primaryStat;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses a precomputed lookup table or map of class data
    structures. Since it returns a const reference, modifications to the underlying
    ClassData should be handled through dedicated setter methods or by rebuilding
    the internal data structure. The implementation may be thread-safe if the internal
    data is immutable after initialization.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered classId may result
    in undefined behavior or access violations. Ensure that all class IDs passed to
    this method are valid and registered within the system before invocation.
