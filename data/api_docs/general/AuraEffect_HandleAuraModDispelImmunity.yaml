documentation:
  brief: Modifies auras to grant immunity to dispel effects.
  description: The HandleAuraModDispelImmunity method is responsible for applying
    or removing dispel immunity effects from an aura application. This method is typically
    invoked during aura application or removal to modify the target's resistance to
    magical dispels. It adjusts the target's state based on whether the dispel immunity
    should be applied or removed, affecting how the aura interacts with dispel mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. The method operates within the TrinityCore framework and
    integrates with the aura system's core functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura is affected
      by the immunity change.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (1) or removed (0). This value determines the direction of the
      state change for dispel immunity.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the dispel immunity. When true, the target gains immunity; when false, immunity
      is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Dispel Immunity
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraModDispelImmunity(auraApp, 1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Dispel Immunity
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraModDispelImmunity(auraApp, 0, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and is called internally
    by the TrinityCore engine during aura application or removal. It does not directly
    modify the target's state but rather influences how dispel mechanics interact
    with the aura.
