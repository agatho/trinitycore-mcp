  class: CalendarInvite
  method: GetStatus
  signature: CalendarInviteStatus CalendarInvite::GetStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current status of a calendar invite.
  description: The GetStatus method returns the CalendarInviteStatus enumeration value
    that represents the current state of the calendar invite. This status indicates
    whether the invite has been accepted, declined, tentative, or is in another state.
    The method provides access to the internal status tracking mechanism used by the
    TrinityCore calendar system to manage player responses to event invitations. This
    information is crucial for displaying accurate invite statuses in the UI and determining
    how to handle the invite within the game's calendar functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A CalendarInviteStatus enumeration value indicating the current state
    of the calendar invite. Possible values include: INVITESTATUS_INVITED, INVITESTATUS_ACCEPTED,
    INVITESTATUS_DECLINED, INVITESTATUS_TENTATIVE, and INVITESTATUS_NOT_SIGNED_UP.'
  examples:
  - title: Check Invite Status
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = player->GetCalendarInvite(inviteId);\nif (invite)\n\
      {\n    CalendarInviteStatus status = invite->GetStatus();\n    switch (status)\n\
      \    {\n        case INVITESTATUS_ACCEPTED:\n            // Handle accepted\
      \ invite\n            break;\n        case INVITESTATUS_DECLINED:\n        \
      \    // Handle declined invite\n            break;\n        default:\n     \
      \       // Handle other statuses\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a const function and does not modify the calendar invite object.
    The returned status value reflects the last known state of the invite as tracked
    by the system, which may be updated asynchronously when players respond to invitations.
