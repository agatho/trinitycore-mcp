documentation:
  brief: Adds a temporary spell to the player's spell book.
  description: The AddTemporarySpell method allows a player to add a temporary spell
    to their character's spell book. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    development for adding spells that are not permanent, such as those added through
    quest rewards or temporary effects. The spell is added with a specific ID and
    will remain in the player's spell book until it expires or is removed manually.
    This functionality is essential for implementing game mechanics where players
    can gain access to spells temporarily during gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddTemporarySpell(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Reward Spell Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddTemporarySpell(12345);

      // This would be used in a quest reward implementation

      // to give the player a temporary spell after completing a quest'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not check if the spell ID is valid or if the player already
    has the spell. It simply adds it to the player's spell book. The spell will be
    removed automatically when it expires, or manually when the player logs out or
    changes zones.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as adding invalid spell IDs can cause
    errors in the game. Also note that this method does not handle spell cooldowns
    or other mechanics related to spell usage.
