  signature: int InstanceMap::GetTeamInInstance() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the team identifier associated with the instance map.
  description: The GetTeamInInstance method returns the team ID that is currently
    associated with this instance map. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    instance maps can be tied to specific teams (Alliance or Horde) for certain content
    types such as battlegrounds or world PvP zones. This method allows scripts and
    systems to determine which faction's players are currently bound to an instance.
    The returned value typically corresponds to either the Alliance team ID (0) or
    the Horde team ID (1), though other values may be used in special cases depending
    on the instance type and game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the team identifier associated with this instance
    map. Common return values are 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, but custom implementations
    or special instances may use different values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check instance team
    code: "InstanceMap* instance = player->GetInstance();\nif (instance)\n{\n    int\
      \ teamId = instance->GetTeamInInstance();\n    if (teamId == 0)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Instance is Alliance-bound.\");\n    else if (teamId == 1)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Instance is Horde-bound.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management systems
    to enforce faction-specific restrictions or to determine appropriate rewards and
    loot distribution. The team ID returned may not always directly correspond to
    Alliance/Horde as it could be used for other purposes like custom PvP zones or
    special event instances.
