  class: Unit
  method: SetAttackPowerModPos
  signature: void Unit::SetAttackPowerModPos(int32 attackPowerMod)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the positive attack power modifier for the unit.
  description: This method modifies the attack power of a Unit by applying a positive
    value to its base attack power calculation. It is used primarily in game mechanics
    related to weapon damage and combat calculations, where the attack power affects
    the effectiveness of physical attacks. The method typically affects the unit's
    main hand attack power and may be used in conjunction with other attack power
    modifiers or when calculating damage for weapons. This modification is applied
    during combat calculations and can influence the outcome of attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPowerMod
    description: The positive attack power modifier value to apply to the unit's attack
      power. This value represents an increase in attack power that affects weapon
      damage calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetAttackPowerModPos(100);

      // Sets attack power modifier to 100'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other attack power related
    methods such as SetAttackPowerModNeg or when calculating weapon damage. The modification
    affects the unit's combat behavior and may be used in scenarios involving player
    versus NPC combat or during specific game events.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as incorrect application
    of attack power modifiers can lead to imbalanced gameplay or unexpected combat
    outcomes. This method should not be used in isolation but rather as part of a
    larger combat system implementation.
