documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerTaxi object, cleaning up associated taxi-related data and
    state.
  description: The ~PlayerTaxi destructor is called automatically when a PlayerTaxi
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of taxi-related information stored within the player's taxi state, including
    any active taxi paths, pending taxi nodes, and associated flight data. In the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this destructor plays a critical role
    in maintaining memory integrity during player logout, teleportation, or when switching
    between different game states where taxi systems are no longer needed. The method
    does not require any specific preconditions as it operates on the internal state
    of the object itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: void

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerTaxi object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PlayerTaxi taxi;\n    // ... use taxi object\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when taxi goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked implicitly by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The cleanup performed includes releasing internal
    taxi path references and resetting flight state flags.
