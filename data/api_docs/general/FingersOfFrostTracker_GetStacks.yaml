  class: FingersOfFrostTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 FingersOfFrostTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Fingers of Frost buff.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Fingers
    of Frost spell effect. This tracker is typically used in conjunction with the
    Frost Mage's Fingers of Frost talent, which increases spell damage and critical
    strike chance for each stack. The returned value represents how many times the
    buff has been applied or refreshed, up to a maximum defined by the talent's rank.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call during combat
    or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of Fingers of Frost stacks.
    Returns 0 if the buff is not active or has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 stacks = fingersOfFrostTracker->GetStacks();\nif (stacks > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Apply effects based on stack count\n    uint32 damageBonus = stacks\
      \ * 5; // Example bonus\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Maximum Stacks
    code: "uint32 stacks = fingersOfFrostTracker->GetStacks();\nif (stacks >= MAX_FINGERS_OF_FROST_STACKS)\n\
      {\n    // Handle max stack behavior\n    // e.g., trigger additional effects\
      \ or reset\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the FingersOfFrostTracker object is properly initialized
    and associated with a valid player or unit. The stack count may be modified by
    other methods such as AddStacks(), RemoveStacks(), or ClearStacks(). This method
    is typically called from spell effect handlers, aura applications, or periodic
    tick functions.
  warnings: Ensure that the FingersOfFrostTracker instance is not null before calling
    this method. Calling GetStacks() on a destroyed or invalid tracker may result
    in undefined behavior or access violations.
