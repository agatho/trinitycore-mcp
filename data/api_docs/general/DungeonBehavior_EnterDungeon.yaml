  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: EnterDungeon
  signature: bool DungeonBehavior::EnterDungeon(Group * group, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to register a group for entry into a specified dungeon instance.
  description: The EnterDungeon method is responsible for processing group entry into
    a dungeon instance within the TrinityCore framework. It validates whether the
    provided group can enter the specified dungeon, considering factors such as group
    composition, instance limits, and player requirements. The method handles the
    necessary game state transitions to prepare the group for dungeon entry, including
    checking if the dungeon is available, managing instance creation or reuse, and
    ensuring that all players in the group meet the prerequisites for entering the
    dungeon. This method is typically invoked when a player or group attempts to enter
    a dungeon via the dungeon finder or direct dungeon entry system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group attempting
      to enter the dungeon. Must be a valid group with at least one member, and all
      members must be in the same map for the operation to proceed.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier of the dungeon instance to enter. This ID corresponds
      to entries in the game's dungeon database, such as those found in the `dungeon_template`
      table. Must represent a valid dungeon with available instances or one that can
      be created.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully registered for entry into the
    specified dungeon, or false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient permissions, instance limits, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Entry
    code: "Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume this is a valid group\nuint32 dungeonEntryId\
      \ = 1234;\nif (playerGroup && dungeonEntryId)\n{\n    bool success = dungeonBehavior->EnterDungeon(playerGroup,\
      \ dungeonEntryId);\n    if (success)\n        sLog->outString(\"Group successfully\
      \ entered dungeon.\");\n    else\n        sLog->outString(\"Failed to enter\
      \ dungeon.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dungeon Entry with Validation
    code: "Group* playerGroup = ...;\nuint32 dungeonId = 5678;\nif (playerGroup &&\
      \ playerGroup->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n{\n    if (dungeonBehavior->EnterDungeon(playerGroup,\
      \ dungeonId))\n    {\n        // Proceed with dungeon-specific logic\n     \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Starting dungeon encounter.\");\n    }\n    else\n   \
      \ {\n        // Handle failure case\n        sLog->outString(\"Cannot enter\
      \ dungeon - check requirements.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal instance creation or assignment logic depending
    on the dungeon type and server configuration. The group must be in a valid state
    (e.g., not already in an instance) before calling this method. It is recommended
    to validate group status and player readiness before invoking EnterDungeon.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid Group pointer or invalid dungeonId
    may result in undefined behavior or server crashes. Always ensure that the group
    contains valid players and that the dungeonId exists in the database before calling
    this function.
