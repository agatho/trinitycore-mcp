api:
  class: NPCEvent
  method: GossipComplete
  signature: NPCEvent NPCEvent::GossipComplete(int playerGuid, int npcGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a gossip interaction between a player and an NPC, finalizing the
    dialogue sequence.
  description: The GossipComplete method is used to finalize a gossip interaction
    within the TrinityCore framework. It signifies that the player has finished interacting
    with an NPC's gossip menu and allows the server to process any pending actions
    or rewards associated with the conversation. This method typically follows a series
    of GossipHello and GossipSelect calls, ensuring proper state management during
    NPC dialogues. The method returns a new NPCEvent instance representing the completed
    interaction, which can be used for further event handling or chaining.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player initiating the gossip
      interaction. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: npcGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC whose gossip is being completed.
      Must be a valid NPC GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns an NPCEvent instance representing the completed gossip interaction,
    which can be used for further processing or event chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Completion
    code: "NPCEvent event = npcEvent.GossipComplete(playerGuid, npcGuid);\n// Process\
      \ the completed event\nif (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Handle post-gossip logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Gossip Completion with Reward Processing
    code: "NPCEvent event = npcEvent.GossipComplete(playerGuid, npcGuid);\nif (event.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Trigger reward distribution or quest completion\n    Player* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(playerGuid);\n    if (player) {\n        // Apply\
      \ rewards based on the completed gossip\n        player->RewardQuestRewards();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a valid GossipHello and GossipSelect
    sequence has occurred. The returned NPCEvent object must be checked for validity
    before processing further actions. Implementation assumes proper GUID validation
    has already been performed.
  warnings: Calling this method without a preceding GossipHello or GossipSelect may
    result in undefined behavior or failed interactions. Ensure that player and NPC
    GUIDs are valid and correspond to active entities in the game world.
