  brief: Confirms pending bind for the player, finalizing character creation and binding
    process
  description: This method confirms the pending bind state for a player, which occurs
    during character creation or when a player is about to be bound to a specific
    instance. It finalizes the binding process by removing any pending bind status
    from the player's data. The method typically executes after a player has completed
    character creation and is ready to proceed with the binding mechanics. This action
    ensures that the player's character is properly bound to their current instance
    or zone, preventing potential issues with character data during gameplay.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ConfirmPendingBind();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during character creation or when a player
    is about to be bound to an instance. It should only be invoked after the player
    has completed all necessary steps for binding, such as completing quest objectives
    or entering a specific zone. The method does not require any parameters and is
    generally used in conjunction with other binding-related methods.
  warnings: This method should not be called during gameplay unless explicitly required
    by game mechanics. Calling it outside of proper context may lead to unexpected
    behavior or binding issues. Also, ensure that the player's pending bind status
    is properly managed before calling this method.
