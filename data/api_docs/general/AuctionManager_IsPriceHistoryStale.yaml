  class: AuctionManager
  method: IsPriceHistoryStale
  signature: bool AuctionManager::IsPriceHistoryStale(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the price history for a specific item in the auction house
    is stale and requires updating.
  description: The IsPriceHistoryStale method checks if the cached price history for
    a given item in the auction house has become outdated. This typically occurs when
    the last update time exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating that the stored
    price data may no longer accurately reflect current market conditions. The method
    is used by the AuctionManager to decide whether to refresh or recalculate price
    trends for items. It plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate auction pricing
    data and ensuring that players see up-to-date market information when browsing
    auctions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the price history for the specified item is considered
    stale and needs refreshing; otherwise returns false if the data is current and
    valid.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Item Price History Needs Refresh
    code: "if (auctionMgr->IsPriceHistoryStale(12345)) {\n    // Trigger price history\
      \ update for item ID 12345\n    auctionMgr->UpdatePriceHistory(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses time-based logic to determine staleness, possibly
    comparing the last updated timestamp against a configurable threshold. It's important
    for performance that this check is efficient since it may be called frequently
    during auction house operations.
