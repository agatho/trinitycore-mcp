  class: GuardianThrashTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 GuardianThrashTracker::GetStacks(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of thrash effects for a specified guardian
    unit.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active thrash debuffs applied
    to a guardian unit identified by its GUID. This method is typically used in AI
    logic to determine the intensity of a guardian's thrash ability application, which
    may influence decision-making for spell casting or movement behavior. The returned
    stack count represents how many times the thrash effect has been applied to the
    target, potentially affecting damage output or other mechanics depending on the
    specific implementation and game context.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guardian unit for which to retrieve
      thrash stacks. This value must correspond to a valid active guardian in the
      current world state.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of thrash stacks currently applied
    to the specified guardian. Returns zero if no thrash effects are active or if
    the GUID does not correspond to a known guardian.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 stacks = tracker.GetStacks(12345); // Retrieves thrash stacks for\
      \ guardian with GUID 12345\nif (stacks > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action based\
      \ on active thrash stacks\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 stacks = tracker.GetStacks(targetGuid);\nif (stacks >= 5)\n{\n \
      \   // Consider using a dispel or avoiding further thrash application\n}\nelse\
      \ if (stacks < 3)\n{\n    // Safe to continue applying thrash effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GuardianThrashTracker maintains an internal
    mapping of GUIDs to their respective stack counts. It is important to ensure that
    the provided GUID corresponds to a valid guardian entity, as invalid or stale
    GUIDs may lead to unexpected results. The method is marked as const, indicating
    it does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method refers to an active guardian
    unit. Using a GUID for a dead or non-existent unit may return incorrect values
    or cause undefined behavior depending on implementation details. Also, be aware
    that stack counts may change between calls if other systems are modifying the
    thrash effects.
