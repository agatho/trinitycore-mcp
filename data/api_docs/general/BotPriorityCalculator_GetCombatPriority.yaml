  class: BotPriorityCalculator
  method: GetCombatPriority
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityCalculator::GetCombatPriority(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the combat priority value for a specified bot.
  description: The GetCombatPriority method determines the relative importance or
    urgency of a bot's combat engagement within the TrinityCore AI system. It evaluates
    various factors such as the bot's current health, target threat level, available
    mana, and combat stance to assign a numerical priority score. This value is used
    by the AI system to decide which bots should be prioritized for attention, resource
    allocation, or tactical positioning during group encounters. The method takes
    a pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier and returns a uint32
    value that indicates its combat priority level.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the bot for which combat priority is being calculated. The value pointed to
      must be a valid bot GUID within the current session.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated combat priority level
    for the specified bot. Higher values indicate higher priority, with 0 typically
    indicating no combat engagement or low priority. Values are determined based on
    internal AI calculations involving health, mana, threat, and target status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\nuint32 priority = calculator.GetCombatPriority(&botGuid);\n\
      if (priority > 0)\n{\n    // Bot is in combat and has a valid priority\n   \
      \ printf(\"Bot %d has combat priority: %u\\n\", botGuid, priority);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Priority Evaluation
    code: "void EvaluateBotCombatPriority(BotPriorityCalculator& calc, std::vector<int>&\
      \ botList)\n{\n    for (int botId : botList)\n    {\n        uint32 priority\
      \ = calc.GetCombatPriority(&botId);\n        if (priority >= 1000)\n       \
      \ {\n            // High-priority combat bot\n            printf(\"High priority\
      \ combat bot: %d\\n\", botId);\n        }\n        else if (priority >= 500)\n\
      \        {\n            // Medium priority combat bot\n            printf(\"\
      Medium priority combat bot: %d\\n\", botId);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI framework and relies on internal
    state tracking of bots. The calculation may vary based on current game conditions,
    bot class, equipped items, and server configuration settings. The returned priority
    value should not be used as a direct combat decision factor without considering
    other AI systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an active bot within the current session; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
    This method may return zero for bots not currently engaged in combat or in certain
    non-combat states.
