documentation:
  brief: Waits for optimal timing to interrupt a spell based on the provided interrupt
    context.
  description: The WaitForOptimalTiming method is responsible for determining when
    it is most advantageous to interrupt an ongoing spell cast. It evaluates the given
    InterruptContext to assess conditions such as spell type, target state, and timing
    constraints. This method typically plays a role in AI decision-making processes
    where strategic interruption of enemy spells is required for tactical advantage.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal state or triggers actions
    based on the evaluation results.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Interrupt AI
    code: "void MySpellInterruptAI::OnSpellCast(const InterruptContext& context)\n\
      {\n    WaitForOptimalTiming(context);\n    // Additional logic to handle the\
      \ interruption\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger spell interruption system and may
    be called from within AI update loops or event handlers. It assumes that the InterruptContext
    contains valid data about the spell being interrupted and the conditions under
    which it should be interrupted.
