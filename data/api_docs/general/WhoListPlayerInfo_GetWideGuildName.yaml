documentation:
  brief: Returns the wide guild name of the player as a wide character string.
  description: The GetWideGuildName method retrieves the full guild name associated
    with a player in wide character format (std::wstring). This is typically used
    in the Who list functionality to display guild information for players. The returned
    value represents the complete guild name including any special characters or spaces,
    and is formatted for Unicode display in the game client. The method does not perform
    any validation or modification of the stored guild name, and will return an empty
    string if the player is not part of a guild.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::wstring containing the wide character representation
    of the player's guild name. Returns an empty string if the player does not belong
    to a guild.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display guild name
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// Assume playerInfo is populated with valid\
      \ data\nconst std::wstring& guildName = playerInfo.GetWideGuildName();\nif (!guildName.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::wcout << L\"Player's Guild: \" << guildName << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::wcout << L\"Player is not in a guild.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an internal data member, so modifications
    to the returned string will not affect the original data. The wide character string
    format ensures proper Unicode support for international guild names and special
    characters.
