  class: SuggestionTicket
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void SuggestionTicket::LoadFromDB(Field * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads ticket data from the database into the SuggestionTicket object.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes a SuggestionTicket object's internal
    state by extracting data from a database row. It populates member variables with
    values retrieved from the provided Field array, which typically corresponds to
    a database result set containing ticket information such as ticket ID, player
    GUID, message content, and status flags. This method is usually invoked during
    ticket creation or retrieval operations within the TrinityCore framework's ticket
    management system. The method assumes that the Field array contains data in the
    correct order matching the expected column structure of the suggestion ticket
    table.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading a SuggestionTicket from Database Result
    code: "Field* fields = loginDatabase.PQuery(\"SELECT id, playerGuid, message,\
      \ createTime, isRead FROM gm_suggestions WHERE id = %u\", ticketId);\nif (fields)\n\
      {\n    SuggestionTicket ticket;\n    ticket.LoadFromDB(fields);\n    // Ticket\
      \ is now populated with data from database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring that the Field array contains
    valid data. The method does not perform any validation on the input data, so it's
    important to ensure that the database query returns properly structured results.
    This method is typically used internally by the ticket system and shouldn't be
    called directly in most cases.
  warnings: Calling LoadFromDB without proper initialization of the Field array may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Field array contains data
    in the correct order matching the expected database schema for suggestion tickets.
