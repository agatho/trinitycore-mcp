documentation:
  brief: Decrements the global player count stored within the World instance.
  description: The DecreasePlayerCount method is responsible for reducing the internal
    player counter maintained by the World class. This method is typically invoked
    when a player character logs out or disconnects from the game server. It ensures
    that the global player count accurately reflects the current number of active
    players in the world. The decrement operation is usually thread-safe and may be
    accompanied by updates to server statistics or maintenance routines. This method
    does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Logout
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform logout logic\n\
      \    player->SaveToDB();\n    \n    // Decrease global player count\n    sWorld->DecreasePlayerCount();\n\
      \    \n    // Continue with cleanup\n    player->RemoveFromWorld();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the server's session management
    system when a player disconnects. It may be part of a larger synchronization mechanism
    to maintain accurate server statistics and prevent overflow conditions in player-related
    systems.
  warnings: Improper use or omission of this method during player logout can lead
    to incorrect player counts, which might affect server performance monitoring,
    anti-cheat systems, or game balance calculations.
