  class: FlameShockTracker
  method: RemoveFlameShock
  signature: void FlameShockTracker::RemoveFlameShock(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a Flame Shock effect from the tracked targets based on the provided
    GUID.
  description: The RemoveFlameShock method is responsible for eliminating a Flame
    Shock aura from a specific target within the FlameShockTracker system. This method
    typically gets invoked when a Flame Shock spell expires, is dispelled, or is intentionally
    removed by game mechanics such as player actions or environmental effects. It
    ensures that the internal tracking state of the Flame Shock effect is properly
    updated and cleaned up for the specified target identified by its GUID. The method
    does not return any value, indicating it performs an action rather than producing
    a result.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target from which the Flame Shock
      effect should be removed. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the
      object's ID in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Flame Shock from a Target
    code: 'FlameShockTracker tracker;

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      tracker.RemoveFlameShock(targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided corresponds to an existing tracked
    target. If the GUID is invalid or does not exist in the tracker's internal data
    structure, the behavior may be undefined or silently ignored depending on implementation
    details.
