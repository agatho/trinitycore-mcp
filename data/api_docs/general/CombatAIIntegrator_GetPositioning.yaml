  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: GetPositioning
  signature: RoleBasedCombatPositioning * CombatAIIntegrator::GetPositioning() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role-based combat positioning strategy associated with this
    AI integrator.
  description: The GetPositioning method returns a pointer to the RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    object that defines how the creature should position itself during combat based
    on its assigned role. This positioning strategy is crucial for determining optimal
    movement patterns, attack ranges, and tactical behavior in group encounters. The
    returned pointer is valid only while the CombatAIIntegrator instance exists and
    should not be deleted by the caller. This method is typically invoked during combat
    state updates to dynamically adjust positioning logic according to current battle
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the RoleBasedCombatPositioning object that governs combat
    positioning behavior, or nullptr if no positioning strategy has been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        RoleBasedCombatPositioning* positioning = combatAIIntegrator->GetPositioning();\n\
      \        if (positioning)\n        {\n            positioning->UpdatePositioning(me,\
      \ target);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Positioning Strategy
    code: "RoleBasedCombatPositioning* positioning = combatAIIntegrator->GetPositioning();\n\
      if (positioning != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use positioning strategy\n    float optimalDistance\
      \ = positioning->GetOptimalCombatRange();\n    // Apply movement logic based\
      \ on positioning\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Fallback to default positioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned RoleBasedCombatPositioning pointer is managed internally by
    the CombatAIIntegrator and should not be deleted or modified. The positioning
    strategy may change during runtime based on role assignments or combat state transitions.
    This method is thread-safe as long as the CombatAIIntegrator instance itself is
    accessed in a thread-safe manner.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the CombatAIIntegrator
    instance, as it may become invalid. Always check for null return values before
    dereferencing to prevent crashes. The positioning strategy object should never
    be modified directly by external code.
