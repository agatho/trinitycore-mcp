documentation:
  brief: Initializes the visibility distance settings for the garrison map.
  description: The InitVisibilityDistance method sets up the initial visibility parameters
    for a GarrisonMap instance. This method is typically called during the map initialization
    phase to configure how far players can see within the garrison environment. It
    establishes default visibility ranges and ensures that the map's rendering system
    has proper distance thresholds for determining which objects should be visible
    to players. The method does not accept any parameters and performs internal setup
    operations related to the map's visual representation.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GarrisonMap* garrisonMap = new GarrisonMap();

      garrisonMap->InitVisibilityDistance();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map initialization process and should
    typically not be called directly by external code. It's designed to be invoked
    automatically during map creation or loading phases in TrinityCore's garrison
    system implementation.
