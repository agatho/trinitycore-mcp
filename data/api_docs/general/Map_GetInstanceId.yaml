  method: GetInstanceId
  signature: uint32 Map::GetInstanceId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique instance identifier for the current map.
  description: The GetInstanceId method retrieves the unique identifier that represents
    the instance ID of the current map. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to track and manage instance-specific data, such as dungeon encounters, loot tables,
    and player progression. The instance ID is typically assigned when a player enters
    an instance or dungeon and remains consistent throughout the duration of that
    instance. This method is essential for identifying which instance a player is
    currently in, particularly for managing instance-based content and ensuring proper
    game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique instance identifier for
    the current map. If no instance is active, this value will be zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 instanceId = map->GetInstanceId();\nif (instanceId != 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Player is in an instance\n    // Do something with instanceId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other instance-related functions
    like GetInstanceId() and GetInstanceType() to determine the current instance state.
    It's important to note that this value may change when a player enters or leaves
    an instance, and it should be used carefully in context of instance management.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where multiple instances
    might exist simultaneously; ensure proper handling of instance IDs to avoid conflicts
    or incorrect data access.
