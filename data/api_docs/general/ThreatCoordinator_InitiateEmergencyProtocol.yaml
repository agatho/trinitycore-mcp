  method: InitiateEmergencyProtocol
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::InitiateEmergencyProtocol()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the emergency threat coordination protocol to handle high-priority
    combat situations.
  description: The InitiateEmergencyProtocol method is designed to activate a specialized
    threat management system within the ThreatCoordinator class. This method typically
    triggers immediate response mechanisms when the current threat level exceeds predefined
    thresholds, ensuring that all involved NPCs or players respond appropriately to
    urgent combat scenarios. It may reset or override normal threat calculations and
    prioritize specific targets based on emergency conditions. The method is usually
    invoked automatically by the core AI system during critical moments such as boss
    encounters or player-versus-player combat where standard threat behaviors are
    insufficient.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Trigger
    code: "void BossEncounter::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Activate emergency protocol\
      \ when boss enters combat\n    threatCoordinator.InitiateEmergencyProtocol();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat scenarios where emergency
    threat coordination is required. It may temporarily disable normal threat calculation
    logic until the emergency state is resolved.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat contexts may cause unexpected
    behavior or disrupt normal AI operations. Ensure that all related threat management
    systems are properly initialized before invoking this protocol.
