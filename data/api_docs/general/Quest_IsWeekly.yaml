  class: Quest
  method: IsWeekly
  signature: bool Quest::IsWeekly() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest is a weekly quest type.
  description: The IsWeekly method checks if the current quest has the weekly quest
    flag set. This flag indicates that the quest can only be completed once per week,
    and the player's progress will reset according to the weekly schedule. Weekly
    quests are typically used for recurring content such as world events or seasonal
    activities. The method returns true if the quest is flagged as weekly, false otherwise.
    This check is commonly used in quest completion logic and UI display to indicate
    special quest types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is a weekly quest type; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if quest is weekly
    code: "if (quest->IsWeekly())\n{\n    // Handle weekly quest specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This is a weekly quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsWeekly in quest completion validation
    code: "void Player::CompleteQuest(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest->IsWeekly()\
      \ && HasQuest(quest->GetQuestId()))\n    {\n        // Weekly quests can only\
      \ be completed once per week\n        SendQuestAlreadyCompleted(quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest flags stored in the database. The
    weekly flag is typically set during quest creation or through quest templates.
    This check should be performed before any quest completion logic to ensure proper
    handling of weekly quest restrictions.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the quest's weekly flag and does
    not validate whether the player has already completed the quest this week. Additional
    logic may be required to properly manage weekly quest progression.
