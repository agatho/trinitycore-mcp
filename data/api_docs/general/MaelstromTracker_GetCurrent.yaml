  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: GetCurrent
  signature: uint32 MaelstromTracker::GetCurrent() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current maelstrom value stored in the MaelstromTracker instance.
  description: The GetCurrent method returns the current amount of maelstrom energy
    that has been accumulated within the MaelstromTracker object. This value typically
    represents the player's or unit's current maelstrom resource level, which is used
    in various game mechanics such as spell casting, ability usage, or aura effects
    related to maelstrom-based abilities. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely a getter function. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other maelstrom-related systems to determine whether a player has sufficient energy
    to perform certain actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current maelstrom amount stored in the
    tracker. This value typically ranges from 0 to a maximum defined by the system,
    and represents the accumulated maelstrom resource level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 currentMaelstrom = tracker->GetCurrent();\nif (currentMaelstrom\
      \ >= 100)\n{\n    // Player has enough maelstrom to cast a spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void CastMaelstromSpell(Player* player)\n{\n    MaelstromTracker* tracker\
      \ = player->GetMaelstromTracker();\n    uint32 current = tracker->GetCurrent();\n\
      \    if (current >= 50)\n    {\n        // Deduct maelstrom and cast spell\n\
      \        tracker->RemoveMaelstrom(50);\n        player->CastSpell(player, 12345,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object's
    state. It should be safe to call from any thread context where the MaelstromTracker
    instance is accessible and valid.
