documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or creates a new game object data entry for the specified spawn
    ID.
  description: The NewOrExistGameObjectData method in the ObjectMgr class is responsible
    for managing game object data entries within the TrinityCore server. It ensures
    that a valid game object data record exists for a given spawn identifier, creating
    one if it does not already exist. This method is typically used during world initialization
    or when spawning game objects to guarantee that all necessary metadata is available.
    The returned reference allows direct modification of the game object's data fields,
    such as position, orientation, and other properties. It plays a critical role
    in maintaining consistency between the database and in-memory representations
    of game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the internal ID (GUID) of the game
    object data entry. This GUID uniquely identifies the object within the server's
    memory space and can be used for further operations like spawning, querying, or
    modifying the object.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving or Creating GameObject Data
    code: 'int& guid = sObjectMgr->NewOrExistGameObjectData(12345);

      // Use guid to access or modify game object data

      printf("GameObject GUID: %d\n", guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spawnId parameter corresponds to a valid entry
    in the game object template system. The returned reference should be used carefully
    as it directly modifies internal data structures. It is recommended to validate
    the existence of templates before calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spawnId may result
    in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that all spawn IDs are properly
    validated against existing game object templates before invoking this method.
