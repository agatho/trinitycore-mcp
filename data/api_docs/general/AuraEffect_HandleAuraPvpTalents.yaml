  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraPvpTalents(const AuraApplication * auraApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes PvP talent effects associated with an aura application.
  description: The HandleAuraPvpTalents method manages the application and removal
    of PvP talent-related effects when an aura is applied or removed from a unit.
    This method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events to
    update the player's PvP talent state, including modifying stats, abilities, or
    other PvP-specific mechanics. It ensures that the correct PvP talent bonuses are
    either granted or revoked based on the aura's active status and the mode of operation.
    The method interacts with the aura application context to determine how to process
    the PvP talent effects.
  parameters:
  - name: auraApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura is triggering
      the PvP talent handling.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating how the aura should be handled (e.g.,
      apply, remove). This value typically corresponds to predefined constants that
      define the behavior during aura application or removal.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This determines the direction of the PvP talent effect processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application
    code: "void MyAuraHandler::HandleApply(AuraApplication const* auraApp, uint8 mode,\
      \ bool apply) const {\n    HandleAuraPvpTalents(auraApp, mode, apply);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with conditional logic
    code: "void PvPAbilityHandler::OnAuraChange(AuraApplication const* auraApp, uint8\
      \ mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (auraApp->GetBase()->GetSpellInfo()->HasEffect(SPELL_EFFECT_APPLY_AURA))\
      \ {\n        HandleAuraPvpTalents(auraApp, mode, apply);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system in TrinityCore and
    should only be called from within the core aura application logic. It assumes
    that the aura application context has been properly initialized and validated
    before execution.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may lead to incorrect PvP talent states
    or unexpected behavior in player abilities. Ensure that all parameters are correctly
    validated before calling this function.
