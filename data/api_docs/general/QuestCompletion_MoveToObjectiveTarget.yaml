api:
  class: QuestCompletion
  method: MoveToObjectiveTarget
  signature: void QuestCompletion::MoveToObjectiveTarget(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot player to the target location specified by a quest objective.
  description: The MoveToObjectiveTarget method is responsible for instructing a bot
    player to navigate to a specific target location defined by a quest objective.
    This method is typically used in automated quest completion systems where the
    AI needs to move the character to interact with NPCs, collect items, or reach
    designated waypoints. The method utilizes the provided QuestObjectiveData to determine
    the target coordinates and movement behavior. It may involve pathfinding, waypoint
    following, or direct teleportation depending on the objective type and game context.
    This functionality is crucial for bot-based quest automation in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will be moved. Must not be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the quest objective, including target location, type, and any movement
      parameters.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToObjectiveTarget
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      QuestObjectiveData objective = ...; // Get quest objective data

      QuestCompletion completion;

      completion.MoveToObjectiveTarget(bot, objective);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MoveToObjectiveTarget in a quest automation context
    code: "void QuestAutomation::ProcessObjective(Player* bot, const QuestObjectiveData&\
      \ objective)\n{\n    if (objective.type == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_INTERACT)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle interaction-specific logic\n        QuestCompletion\
      \ completion;\n        completion.MoveToObjectiveTarget(bot, objective);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the bot's movement system and may trigger
    pathfinding calculations. It assumes that the provided objective data is valid
    and contains proper target coordinates. The method might internally handle different
    movement types (walking, running, flying) based on the objective requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid null pointer dereferences. The QuestObjectiveData must contain valid
    target information; otherwise, movement behavior may be unpredictable or fail
    silently.
