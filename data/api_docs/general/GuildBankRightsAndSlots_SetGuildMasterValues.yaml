documentation:
  brief: Sets guild bank rights and slot configurations to default values for guild
    masters.
  description: The SetGuildMasterValues method configures the guild bank rights and
    slot permissions for guild masters within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    typically initializes or resets the access levels and storage capacities for the
    highest-ranking guild members, ensuring they have full administrative privileges
    over the guild's bank system. It is commonly invoked during guild creation, rank
    promotion, or when restoring default settings for guild master permissions. The
    method operates on internal data structures that manage which guild members can
    access specific tabs, withdraw items, deposit items, and modify tab permissions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Guild Master Permissions
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots rightsAndSlots;

      rightsAndSlots.SetGuildMasterValues();

      // This sets all guild master rights and slot configurations to default values.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal member variables of the GuildBankRightsAndSlots
    class, such as access flags for different tabs and slot limits. It should only
    be called when initializing or resetting guild master permissions, not during
    regular gameplay operations to avoid unintended side effects.
  warnings: Calling this method inappropriately may result in loss of existing guild
    bank configurations or unexpected behavior if other systems depend on current
    rights settings. Ensure that this function is used only during controlled initialization
    phases.
