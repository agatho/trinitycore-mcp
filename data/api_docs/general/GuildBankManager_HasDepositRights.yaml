  signature: bool GuildBankManager::HasDepositRights(int * player, uint32 tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has deposit rights for a specific guild bank tab
  description: The HasDepositRights method determines whether a given player possesses
    the necessary permissions to deposit items into a specified guild bank tab. This
    functionality is integral to the guild bank system in TrinityCore, where different
    tabs can have varying access controls based on player ranks or guild permissions.
    The method verifies the player's current guild membership and their assigned rights
    for the specific tab ID provided. It ensures that only authorized players can
    add items to protected guild bank sections.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the game system
  - name: tabId
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer identifying the specific guild bank tab to
      check deposit rights for. Valid values typically range from 0 to the maximum
      number of tabs configured in the guild bank
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the player has deposit rights for the
    specified tab. Returns true if the player is authorized to deposit items, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 tabId = 2;\nbool hasRights = guildBankManager->HasDepositRights(&playerId,\
      \ tabId);\nif (hasRights) {\n    // Player can deposit items into tab 2\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guild Bank Operations
    code: "void HandleItemDeposit(Player* player, uint32 tabId, Item* item) {\n  \
      \  int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n    if (guildBankManager->HasDepositRights(&playerId,\
      \ tabId)) {\n        // Proceed with deposit operation\n        guildBankManager->DepositItem(player,\
      \ tabId, item);\n    } else {\n        // Send error message to player\n   \
      \     player->SendNotification(\"You do not have permission to deposit items\
      \ in this tab.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the guild's rank system
    and tab-specific permissions. It may cache results or use fast lookup mechanisms
    for performance reasons. The player parameter should be a valid GUID, and tabId
    must correspond to an existing tab in the guild bank structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method.
    Invalid tab IDs could lead to undefined behavior or access violations. This method
    assumes proper initialization of the GuildBankManager instance and valid game
    state context.
