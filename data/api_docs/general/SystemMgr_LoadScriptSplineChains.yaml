documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes scripted spline chains for creature movement paths.
  description: The LoadScriptSplineChains method is responsible for loading and processing
    spline chain data that defines custom movement paths for creatures in the game
    world. This method typically reads from database tables or configuration files
    containing spline point coordinates and timing information, then constructs internal
    data structures representing these movement chains. It ensures that scripted paths
    are properly registered with the movement system so that creatures can follow
    predefined routes during their AI behavior. The method is usually invoked during
    server startup or when loading world data to ensure all scripted movements are
    available for active creatures.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sSystemMgr->LoadScriptSplineChains();\n    // Continue with other systems...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to retrieve spline chain definitions
    and may cache results for performance. It's typically called once during server
    bootstrapping before any creatures begin moving along scripted paths.
