  signature: const CriteriaList & CriteriaMgr::GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaByType(int
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of quest objective criteria matching the specified type.
  description: The GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaByType method returns a constant reference
    to a list of criteria that are associated with quest objectives and match the
    given type. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to
    fetch specific criteria related to quest completion, such as killing creatures,
    collecting items, or reaching certain levels. The returned CriteriaList is immutable,
    ensuring that external code cannot modify the internal state of the criteria manager.
    This function does not perform any validation on the input type, assuming it's
    a valid criterion type defined within the game's database or codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList containing all quest objective criteria
    that match the specified type. The list is empty if no matching criteria are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through criteria of a specific type
    code: "const CriteriaList& criteriaList = criteriaMgr.GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaByType(CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE);\n\
      for (const auto& criterion : criteriaList) {\n    // Process each criterion\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Criterion ID: \" << criterion->id << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CriteriaMgr class which manages various types
    of criteria used in achievements and quests. The returned list should not be modified,
    as it's a const reference to internal data structures. Performance-wise, this
    method likely uses an internal map or lookup table for fast access based on type.
