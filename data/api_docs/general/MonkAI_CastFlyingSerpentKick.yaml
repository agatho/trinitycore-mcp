  class: MonkAI
  method: CastFlyingSerpentKick
  signature: void MonkAI::CastFlyingSerpentKick(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Flying Serpent Kick ability on the specified target.
  description: The CastFlyingSerpentKick method executes the Monk's Flying Serpent
    Kick spell, which is a damaging ability that deals damage to a single target.
    This method is typically used within the MonkAI class to control the behavior
    of monk NPCs or player-controlled monks in combat situations. The spell may have
    specific cooldowns, mana costs, and targeting requirements depending on the game
    version and class specialization. It's designed to be called during AI decision-making
    processes when the monk is in a suitable state to cast this ability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Context
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastFlyingSerpentKick(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core spell system of TrinityCore and
    may require the target to be within range and in a valid combat state. The actual
    casting behavior, including animation and damage calculation, is handled by the
    underlying spell engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior or crashes. Calling this method without proper target
    validation can lead to invalid memory access.
