  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetAccountIdFromCharacter
  signature: uint32 BotSpawner::GetAccountIdFromCharacter(int characterGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account identifier associated with a specified character GUID.
  description: The GetAccountIdFromCharacter method is used to obtain the unique account
    ID that owns a specific character within the TrinityCore database. This function
    takes a character's global unique identifier (GUID) as input and returns the corresponding
    account ID. It serves as a lookup mechanism for associating characters with their
    respective accounts, which is essential for bot management systems and player-related
    operations in World of Warcraft emulation environments. The method assumes that
    the provided character GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing character
    in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the character for which to
      retrieve the associated account ID. This value typically represents a 32-bit
      unsigned integer that uniquely identifies a specific character within the game
      world.
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the account ID associated with the
    specified character GUID. Returns zero if no matching character is found or if
    an error occurs during the lookup process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSpawner->GetAccountIdFromCharacter(123456);\nif (accountId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process valid account ID\n    std::cout << \"Account ID:\
      \ \" << accountId << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid character\
      \ GUID or lookup failure\n    std::cout << \"Character not found or error occurred.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "void AssignBotToAccount(BotSpawner* spawner, uint32 characterGuid)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 accountId = spawner->GetAccountIdFromCharacter(characterGuid);\n\
      \    if (accountId != 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with bot assignment logic\
      \ using the account ID\n        std::cout << \"Assigning bot to account: \"\
      \ << accountId << std::endl;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Log error or\
      \ throw exception\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to retrieve account for character\
      \ GUID: \" << characterGuid << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query to fetch the account ID from
    the character's record. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections
    due to potential database access overhead. The method is marked as const, indicating
    it does not modify any internal state of the BotSpawner object.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided characterGuid parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an actual character in the database; otherwise, the method will return zero,
    which might be interpreted as a successful lookup with no associated account.
    Avoid calling this method repeatedly in tight loops without caching results.
