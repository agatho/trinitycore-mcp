api:
  class: InstanceLock
  method: GetMapId
  signature: uint32 InstanceLock::GetMapId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map identifier associated with this instance lock.
  description: The GetMapId method returns the unique map identifier (MapID) that
    corresponds to the instance lock. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to track which specific map or dungeon instance is locked for a player or group.
    The returned value typically matches the MapID defined in the game's map database
    and is essential for determining instance-specific behavior, such as loot distribution,
    quest tracking, and player movement restrictions within locked instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the map identifier (MapID) of the instance
    lock. This ID uniquely identifies the map or dungeon instance that is currently
    locked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Map ID
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();

      uint32 mapId = lock->GetMapId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Player is in instance with MapID: %u", mapId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other instance-related
    APIs to manage player access and tracking within locked instances. The returned
    MapID should be validated against the game's map definitions to ensure correctness.
