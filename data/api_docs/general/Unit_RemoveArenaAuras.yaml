documentation:
  brief: Removes all arena auras from the unit
  description: This method removes all arena-related auras from the specified unit,
    including buffs and debuffs that are specific to arena battles. It is typically
    used during arena match end or when a player leaves an arena queue. The method
    ensures that no arena-specific effects remain on the unit after the match concludes,
    which helps maintain game balance and prevents unintended side effects from lingering
    arena bonuses.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetPlayer();\n target->RemoveArenaAuras();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when a player exits an arena match to prevent
    any lingering effects from affecting gameplay. The implementation internally handles
    removal of all arena-related auras, including those applied by the system during
    arena battles.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in loss of important arena buffs
    or debuffs that should remain active until the end of the match. Always ensure
    proper timing of this call to avoid unintended consequences.
