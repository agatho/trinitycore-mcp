documentation:
  brief: Updates system performance metrics for bot monitoring purposes.
  description: The UpdateSystemMetrics method collects and records current system
    resource usage data, including CPU load, memory consumption, and other relevant
    performance indicators. This method is typically invoked periodically to monitor
    the health and efficiency of the game server's performance when running AI-controlled
    bots. It helps in identifying potential bottlenecks or resource constraints that
    may affect bot behavior or overall server stability. The collected metrics are
    used internally by the BotPerformanceMonitor class for analysis and optimization
    purposes.
