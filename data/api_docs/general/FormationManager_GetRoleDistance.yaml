  class: FormationManager
  method: GetRoleDistance
  signature: float FormationManager::GetRoleDistance(FormationRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the distance associated with a specified formation role.
  description: The GetRoleDistance method returns the predefined distance value that
    corresponds to a given FormationRole. This distance is typically used by the AI
    system to maintain proper spacing between units in a formation. The method accesses
    internal data structures that map each role type to its respective distance parameter,
    ensuring consistent positioning behavior across different unit types and roles
    within a group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance associated with the specified FormationRole.
    Returns 0.0f if the role is invalid or not found in the internal mapping.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve distance for a leader role
    code: 'float distance = formationManager.GetRoleDistance(FormationRole::LEADER);

      // Returns the distance value configured for the leader role in the formation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use with conditional logic
    code: "FormationRole role = FormationRole::FOLLOWER;\nfloat dist = formationManager.GetRoleDistance(role);\n\
      if (dist > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the distance for positioning calculations\n\
      \    unit->SetPosition(unit->GetPosition().x + dist, unit->GetPosition().y,\
      \ unit->GetPosition().z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during formation initialization or when recalculating
    positions. The returned values are usually pre-defined constants or configurable
    parameters set in the core configuration files or through database entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationRole enum value passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid roles may return unexpected results. This method should not be called
    during active formation updates without proper synchronization.
