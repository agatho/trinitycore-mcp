  brief: Feeds a pet with a specified item to increase its happiness.
  description: The EffectFeedPet method handles the mechanics of feeding a pet with
    an item to increase its happiness level. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with spell effects that allow players to feed their summoned pets with specific
    items such as meat or other consumable items. The method ensures that the pet's
    happiness is properly increased, which affects the pet's behavior and performance
    during combat. It also handles the removal of the consumed item from the player's
    inventory.

  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution when the player's
    pet needs to be fed. It requires that the pet be summoned and that the player
    has the appropriate item in their inventory.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a pet is active and summoned. If
    called without an active pet, it may cause errors or unexpected behavior.
