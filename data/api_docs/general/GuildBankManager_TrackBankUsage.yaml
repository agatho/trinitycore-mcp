documentation:
  brief: Tracks guild bank usage operations for a player.
  description: The TrackBankUsage method records and logs specific bank operations
    performed by a player within the guild bank system. This function is typically
    used to monitor item transactions, withdrawals, deposits, and other interactions
    with the guild's shared storage. It maintains internal tracking mechanisms that
    may be used for audit purposes, logging, or enforcing guild bank rules. The method
    operates on a provided player identifier and the type of operation being performed,
    updating relevant internal counters or logs accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is performing the bank operation.
  - name: operation
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of bank operation being performed,
      such as deposit, withdrawal, or transfer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Track a player depositing an item
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildBankManager();

      int playerId = 12345;

      BankOperation op = BANK_OP_DEPOSIT;

      bankMgr->TrackBankUsage(&playerId, op);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger guild bank management system and may
    interact with database logging or in-memory tracking structures. It assumes valid
    player GUIDs and operation types are passed to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid player GUIDs or undefined operation types could lead to
    incorrect tracking or potential crashes. Ensure proper validation before calling
    this method.
