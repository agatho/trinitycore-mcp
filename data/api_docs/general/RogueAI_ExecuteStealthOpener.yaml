  signature: bool RogueAI::ExecuteStealthOpener(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the stealth opener ability for a rogue AI, returning true if successful.
  description: The ExecuteStealthOpener method is responsible for triggering the initial
    stealth-based attack sequence for a rogue AI character. This method typically
    involves checking preconditions such as whether the rogue is currently in stealth
    mode, if the target is valid and within range, and if sufficient energy or resources
    are available to perform the opener. The method may also handle the logic for
    selecting the appropriate stealth ability based on the current combat situation
    and player class specialization. It returns true upon successful execution of
    the stealth opener, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the stealth opener was successfully executed; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (rogueAI->ExecuteStealthOpener(&targetId)) {\n    // Stealth opener\
      \ executed successfully\n    printf(\"Stealth opener executed\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Failed to execute stealth opener\n    printf(\"Failed to execute\
      \ stealth opener\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the rogue AI has already entered stealth mode and
    that the target is valid. The actual implementation may vary depending on the
    specific rogue specialization (e.g., Subtlety, Assassination, Outlaw). Performance-wise,
    this method should be lightweight as it's typically called in combat loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the rogue AI has sufficient resources before calling this
    method to avoid failed executions. Also, verify that the target is valid and within
    range to prevent undefined behavior or errors during execution.
