  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ProtectHealer
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ProtectHealer(int healerGuid, Unit * attacker)
documentation:
  brief: Applies threat management to protect a healer unit from incoming attackers.
  description: The ProtectHealer method is used within the ThreatCoordinator class
    to manage and control threat distribution in a combat scenario, specifically focusing
    on safeguarding healer units. When invoked, it ensures that the specified healer
    unit receives appropriate protection by adjusting the threat levels of nearby
    attackers. This mechanism is typically employed in AI-driven group combat behaviors
    where maintaining healer survivability is crucial for sustained damage output.
    The method modifies the internal threat state of the system to prioritize the
    healer's safety over other targets.
  parameters:
  - name: healerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the healer unit that requires protection.
      This value must correspond to a valid Unit object in the game world.
  - name: attacker
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the attacker that is currently
      threatening the healer. Must not be null and should be a valid combatant in
      the current encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Protection for a Healer
    code: "void ApplyHealerProtection(uint64 healerGuid, Unit* attacker)\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator\
      \ coordinator;\n    coordinator.ProtectHealer(healerGuid, attacker);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ProtectHealer in Combat AI
    code: "void CombatAI::OnUnitAttacked(Unit* target, Unit* attacker)\n{\n    if\
      \ (target->IsHealer())\n    {\n        ThreatCoordinator coordinator;\n    \
      \    coordinator.ProtectHealer(target->GetGUID(), attacker);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core threat management system and should be called
    during combat events when a healer unit is under attack. It modifies internal
    AI state and may affect overall group threat distribution. The method assumes
    that both the healer and attacker are valid units within the same combat context.
  warnings: Ensure that the healerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual healer unit
    in the current encounter, as passing invalid GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, avoid calling this method outside of combat scenarios where threat management
    is active, as it may interfere with normal AI operations.
