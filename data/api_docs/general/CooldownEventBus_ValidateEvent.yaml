  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool CooldownEventBus::ValidateEvent(const CooldownEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a cooldown event is properly formatted and meets all required
    conditions for processing.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given CooldownEvent object contains
    valid data and adheres to expected constraints. It ensures that all necessary
    fields are populated, values fall within acceptable ranges, and the event can
    be safely processed by the cooldown system. This validation is crucial before
    applying or registering cooldowns to prevent runtime errors or unexpected behavior
    in the game mechanics. The method performs checks on event identifiers, time values,
    and associated cooldown properties to guarantee integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The CooldownEvent object to validate. This parameter must be a valid
      instance of the CooldownEvent class containing all required fields such as event
      ID, start time, duration, and associated cooldown information.
  returns: Returns true if the event passes all validation checks and is considered
    valid for processing; otherwise returns false if any validation constraint fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "CooldownEvent testEvent;\ntestEvent.id = 12345;\ntestEvent.startTime =\
      \ time(nullptr);\ntestEvent.duration = 30;\n\nbool isValid = cooldownBus.ValidateEvent(testEvent);\n\
      if (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with cooldown processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Cooldown Registration
    code: "void RegisterCooldown(CooldownEvent& event) {\n    if (!cooldownBus.ValidateEvent(event))\
      \ {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid cooldown event detected: {}\", event.id);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with valid event registration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs comprehensive validation including checking for negative
    durations, invalid timestamps, and missing required fields. It is designed to
    be lightweight but thorough, ensuring that only well-formed cooldown events are
    accepted into the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or partially constructed CooldownEvent
    object may lead to false negatives or undefined behavior. Always ensure the event
    object is properly initialized before validation.
