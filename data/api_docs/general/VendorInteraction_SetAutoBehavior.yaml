  class: VendorInteraction
  method: SetAutoBehavior
  signature: void VendorInteraction::SetAutoBehavior(bool autoSell, bool autoRepair,
    bool autoBuyReagents)
documentation:
  brief: Configures automatic vendor behaviors for selling items, repairing equipment,
    and buying reagents.
  description: The SetAutoBehavior method enables or disables automatic actions performed
    by a vendor interaction instance. When enabled, the vendor will automatically
    sell items that are no longer needed, repair player equipment when necessary,
    and purchase reagents required for crafting. This functionality is typically used
    in automated NPC vendor systems to streamline gameplay interactions without requiring
    manual input from players. The method does not validate whether these behaviors
    are appropriate for the current context; it simply sets the flags that control
    behavior execution.
  parameters:
  - name: autoSell
    description: If true, enables automatic selling of items that are no longer needed
      by the vendor. If false, disables this behavior.
  - name: autoRepair
    description: If true, enables automatic repair of player equipment when the vendor
      has sufficient funds. If false, disables this behavior.
  - name: autoBuyReagents
    description: If true, enables automatic purchase of reagents required for crafting
      by the vendor. If false, disables this behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable All Auto Behaviors
    code: 'VendorInteraction* vendor = ...;

      vendor->SetAutoBehavior(true, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Repair Only
    code: 'VendorInteraction* vendor = ...;

      vendor->SetAutoBehavior(true, false, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal flags that determine behavior during vendor
    transactions. It's typically called during initialization or configuration of
    a vendor NPC to set up default automatic actions. The actual execution of these
    behaviors depends on the vendor's inventory, player's equipment state, and available
    funds.
  warnings: Setting all parameters to true may cause unexpected behavior if the vendor
    does not have sufficient resources or if the player's inventory is full. Ensure
    that appropriate checks are performed before enabling all automatic behaviors
    in a live environment.
