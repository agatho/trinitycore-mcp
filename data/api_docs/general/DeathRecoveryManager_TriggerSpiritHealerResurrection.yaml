  brief: Initiates a spirit healer resurrection for a player who has died.
  description: The TriggerSpiritHealerResurrection method attempts to resurrect a
    player using the spirit healer mechanism, typically invoked when a player dies
    and needs to be brought back to life through the spirit healer system. This method
    handles the logic of finding an available spirit healer, processing the resurrection
    event, and updating the player's state accordingly. It is part of the death recovery
    system in TrinityCore and may involve checks for valid resurrection conditions
    such as player location, spirit healer availability, and cooldown periods. The
    method returns true if the resurrection was successfully initiated, or false if
    it failed due to invalid conditions or system constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spirit healer resurrection was successfully triggered
    and processed, otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    player state, lack of available spirit healers, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.TriggerSpiritHealerResurrection()) {\n    // Resurrection\
      \ initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player resurrection triggered\
      \ via spirit healer.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to trigger resurrection\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to trigger spirit healer resurrection.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player death processing and should
    only be invoked when the player is in a state where resurrection via spirit healer
    is appropriate. It may involve server-side cooldowns or restrictions based on
    player location or game rules.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of proper death handling contexts, as
    it might lead to inconsistent player states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    the player object is valid and in a state suitable for resurrection before invoking
    this method.
