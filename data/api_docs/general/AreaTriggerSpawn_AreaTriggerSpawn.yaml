documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AreaTriggerSpawn object with default values and prepares
    it for use in the game world.
  description: The AreaTriggerSpawn constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AreaTriggerSpawn class. This method sets up the internal state of the area trigger
    spawn object, including initializing member variables to their default values.
    It ensures that the object is properly configured before being used within the
    TrinityCore framework for managing area triggers in the game world. The constructor
    typically handles memory allocation and setup required for area trigger functionality,
    such as setting up spawn positions, trigger parameters, and linking to relevant
    game entities or systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of AreaTriggerSpawn
    code: 'AreaTriggerSpawn spawn;

      // The spawn object is now initialized and ready for use in area trigger management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating new AreaTriggerSpawn
    objects. Developers should not need to call this directly unless implementing
    custom spawning logic or inheritance patterns. The initialization process may
    involve setting default values for spawn coordinates, trigger radius, and other
    area trigger properties.
