documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes combat triggers for AI behavior in the game world
  description: The CreateCombatTriggers method is responsible for setting up trigger
    mechanisms that activate specific AI behaviors during combat situations. This
    method typically configures conditions, events, and actions that define how NPCs
    respond to various combat scenarios such as target acquisition, health thresholds,
    or spell casting. It integrates with the TrinityCore's AI system to ensure proper
    combat logic execution and event handling within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of trigger creation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while negative
    values may represent specific error codes for different failure scenarios such
    as invalid configuration or resource allocation issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize() override\
      \ {\n        TriggerFactory factory;\n        int result = factory.CreateCombatTriggers();\n\
      \        if (result == 0) {\n            // Triggers successfully created\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during NPC AI initialization and should only
    be invoked once per creature instance. The triggers created are usually persistent
    throughout the creature's lifetime and may interact with other AI components such
    as movement, targeting, or spell casting systems.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times on the same instance may lead to duplicate
    trigger creation or memory leaks. Ensure that the AI system is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as it relies on valid combat context and configuration
    data.
