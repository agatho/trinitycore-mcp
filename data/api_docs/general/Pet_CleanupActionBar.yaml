  brief: Removes invalid or unused entries from the pet's action bar
  description: The CleanupActionBar method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    of a pet's action bar by removing any invalid, unused, or corrupted entries. This
    method ensures that the action bar only contains valid abilities and spells that
    the pet can actually use. It typically runs during pet initialization, when abilities
    are modified, or when cleaning up after certain game events. The method iterates
    through the pet's action bar slots and removes any entries that do not correspond
    to valid pet abilities or spells, preventing errors in the UI and ensuring proper
    behavior of the pet's actions.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    pet state management. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    modify the pet's spell list or ability set, but rather cleans up the action bar
    representation of those abilities.
