  method: IsDeathPersistent
  signature: bool AuraScript::IsDeathPersistent() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura persists through death.
  description: The IsDeathPersistent method checks if the aura script is configured
    to remain active even after the target player or creature dies. This is commonly
    used for auras that should continue to apply effects such as resurrection protection,
    soulstone effects, or other death-immune mechanics. The method returns true if
    the aura is set to persist through death, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing certain class abilities, talents, or item effects
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore-based servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura persists through death, false if it is removed
    upon death.

    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* aurEff, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        if (IsDeathPersistent())\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply special logic for death-persistent auras\n\
      \            SendNotification(\"This aura persists through death.\");\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AuraScript event handlers such as OnApply
    or OnRemove to determine how the aura behaves during character death. It's important
    to note that not all auras are death persistent by default, and this setting must
    be explicitly configured in the aura's definition or through script logic.
