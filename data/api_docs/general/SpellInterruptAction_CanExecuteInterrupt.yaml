  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: CanExecuteInterrupt
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::CanExecuteInterrupt(BotAI * ai, const InterruptContext
    & interruptContext) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell interrupt action can be executed based on the
    provided AI context and interrupt conditions.
  description: The CanExecuteInterrupt method evaluates if a bot's current state and
    the given interrupt context allow for the execution of a spell interruption action.
    This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI framework to control when
    bots should interrupt their ongoing spells, such as when targeted by an enemy
    or when certain combat conditions are met. It checks various preconditions including
    whether the bot is currently casting a spell, if the interrupt context is valid,
    and if the bot's current situation allows for interruption without violating game
    rules or AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that manages the bot's behavior and
      decision-making process. Used to access the bot's current state, spell casting
      information, and other relevant AI data.
  - name: interruptContext
    description: Reference to an InterruptContext object containing details about
      the interrupt trigger, such as the source of interruption, type of interrupt,
      and associated spell or effect that initiated it.
  returns: Returns true if the spell interrupt action can be executed under the current
    conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates
    that either the bot is not currently casting a spell, the interrupt context is
    invalid, or other game logic prevents the interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Logic
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.CanExecuteInterrupt(ai, interruptContext)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with interrupting the current spell\n    ai->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Event Handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnCombatEvent(InterruptContext& context) {\n    if (spellInterruptAction.CanExecuteInterrupt(this,\
      \ context)) {\n        // Handle spell interruption logic\n        InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the integrity of both the BotAI instance and
    the interruptContext object. It is recommended that callers validate these inputs
    before invoking this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The method may perform
    checks against internal bot state flags, spell casting timers, and combat conditions,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency call scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of the BotAI pointer or interruptContext can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that ai is not null and that interruptContext
    contains valid data before calling this method. Also note that some spell interruptions
    may have cooldowns or restrictions that are not checked by this method alone.
