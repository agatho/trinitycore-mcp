documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell rank data from the database into memory for spell
    progression and hierarchy management.
  description: The LoadSpellRanks method is responsible for loading spell rank information
    from the database tables into internal data structures within the SpellMgr class.
    This method ensures that spells with multiple ranks (such as Arcane Missiles or
    Healing Wave) are properly organized in a hierarchy, allowing the game engine
    to correctly handle spell progression, replacement mechanics, and rank-based spell
    selection. It typically runs during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure all spell rank relationships are available for runtime use. The method
    processes data related to spell ranks, including which spells replace others at
    different levels and how spell effects scale across ranks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSpellRanks()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellRanks();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It modifies internal spell rank lookup tables and should not be called during
    active gameplay sessions unless the spell data has been updated externally. The
    method assumes that database connections are already established and that relevant
    spell rank tables contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method while active gameplay is occurring may cause inconsistent
    behavior or crashes due to race conditions in spell rank lookups. It should only
    be used during controlled initialization or reload phases when no players are
    actively casting spells.
