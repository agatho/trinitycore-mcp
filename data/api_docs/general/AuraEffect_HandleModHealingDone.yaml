  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleModHealingDone
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModHealingDone(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the amount of healing done by the aura's owner.
  description: The HandleModHealingDone method is responsible for adjusting the healing
    output of an aura's caster or target based on the applied aura effect. This method
    is typically invoked during aura application or removal to modify how much healing
    is performed by the affected unit. It takes into account the aura application
    state, mode of operation (such as whether it's being applied or removed), and
    whether the effect should be active. The method directly influences game mechanics
    related to healing buffs, debuffs, and other effects that alter healing values.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura is triggering
      the modification and its current state.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation for the
      aura effect. This value typically determines how the healing modification should
      be processed, such as whether it's additive or multiplicative, or if it affects
      specific types of healing.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This parameter controls the direction of the healing modification
      and ensures proper state management during aura lifecycle events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleModHealingDone(const AuraApplication* aurApp,\
      \ uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Increase healing\
      \ done by 20%\n        GetTarget()->ApplyModUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_MOD_HEALING_DONE_PCT,\
      \ 20);\n    } else {\n        // Remove the healing increase\n        GetTarget()->ApplyModUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_MOD_HEALING_DONE_PCT,\
      \ -20);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura effect handling system in TrinityCore and
    is called internally by the core engine when an aura's state changes. Developers
    should ensure that any modifications to healing values are consistent with game
    balance and do not introduce exploits or unintended behavior.
  warnings: Improperly implemented aura effects can lead to incorrect healing calculations,
    which may affect gameplay balance. Ensure that all healing modifiers are properly
    validated and applied only when necessary.
