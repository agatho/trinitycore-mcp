  method: OnInterruptRequired
  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int * target, uint32
    param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required interrupt logic for Havoc Demon Hunter abilities
  description: The OnInterruptRequired method is invoked when a Havoc Demon Hunter's
    ability requires an interrupt to be processed. This method typically manages the
    state transitions and validation checks needed before allowing an interrupt action
    to proceed. It may handle cooldowns, resource requirements, or target validation
    for interrupt-based spells. The method modifies the target parameter to reflect
    any changes in the interrupt handling process, such as updating the target's interrupt
    status or applying interrupt effects.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target of the interrupt action.
      This value may be modified by the method to indicate interrupt success or failure
      states.
  - name: param1
    description: A uint32 parameter that likely represents spell ID, interrupt type,
      or other contextual data needed for interrupt processing logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt handling example
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      hunter->OnInterruptRequired(&targetId, spellId);

      // Process the updated targetId for interrupt effects'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced interrupt with validation
    code: "int targetId = player->GetTarget()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\nuint32 interruptType\
      \ = 1;\nif (player->HasAura(12345)) // Check for existing interrupt\n{\n   \
      \ hunter->OnInterruptRequired(&targetId, interruptType);\n    // Apply interrupt\
      \ effects based on updated targetId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Havoc Demon Hunter AI behavior system and should
    only be called during active combat scenarios. The target parameter may be modified
    to reflect interrupt success or failure, so callers should check the updated value
    after the call.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. The param1 value must correspond to a valid interrupt
    type or spell ID for proper behavior.
