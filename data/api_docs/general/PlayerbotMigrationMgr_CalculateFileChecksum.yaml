  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: CalculateFileChecksum
  signature: std::string PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CalculateFileChecksum(const std::string
    & filepath)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the MD5 checksum of a specified file path for playerbot
    migration purposes.
  description: The CalculateFileChecksum method computes the MD5 hash of a given file
    located at the specified filepath. This functionality is primarily used within
    the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class to verify file integrity during player bot migration
    processes. The method reads the entire contents of the file and generates a cryptographic
    checksum that can be used to detect changes or corruption in the file. It's commonly
    employed when migrating player bot configurations or data between different versions
    or instances of the TrinityCore server. The method assumes the file exists and
    is readable, though it may throw exceptions if access permissions are denied or
    if the file is inaccessible.
  parameters:
  - name: filepath
    description: The absolute or relative path to the file for which the MD5 checksum
      will be calculated. Must point to a valid, readable file on the filesystem.
  returns: A std::string containing the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 checksum
    for the specified file. Returns an empty string if the file cannot be accessed
    or read.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to calculate a file's checksum
    code: "std::string checksum = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CalculateFileChecksum(\"\
      config/playerbots.xml\");\nif (!checksum.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"File\
      \ checksum: \" << checksum << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr << \"Failed\
      \ to calculate checksum for file.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the checksum for migration verification
    code: "std::string configPath = \"config/playerbots.xml\";\nstd::string currentChecksum\
      \ = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CalculateFileChecksum(configPath);\n// Compare with\
      \ previously stored checksum to verify integrity\nif (currentChecksum == previousChecksum)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with migration\n    std::cout << \"Configuration unchanged,\
      \ proceeding with migration.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Configuration\
      \ has changed, handle accordingly\n    std::cout << \"Configuration changed,\
      \ aborting migration.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full file read operation which may impact performance
    for large files. It is recommended to cache checksum results when possible. The
    implementation uses standard MD5 hashing and assumes the system has sufficient
    memory to load the entire file into memory during processing.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the file exists before attempting
    to read it, so calling code should ensure the file path is valid. If the file
    is locked or inaccessible due to permissions, the method may return an empty string
    without throwing an exception. Large files will consume significant memory during
    processing.
