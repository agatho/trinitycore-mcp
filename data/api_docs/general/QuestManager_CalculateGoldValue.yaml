  class: QuestManager
  method: CalculateGoldValue
  signature: float QuestManager::CalculateGoldValue(const Quest * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the gold value of a quest based on its objectives
    and rewards.
  description: The CalculateGoldValue method computes the total gold reward value
    for a given quest by evaluating its reward items, experience points, and any additional
    monetary bonuses. This calculation is used internally by the TrinityCore server
    to determine how much gold a player should receive upon completing the quest.
    The method takes into account various quest properties such as quest level, reward
    distribution, and game balance factors to ensure appropriate gold rewards are
    awarded. It does not modify any quest state or player data; it simply performs
    a calculation based on the provided quest's configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the total gold reward amount for the quest.
    This value may include fractional gold components and is typically converted to
    copper for actual reward distribution in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      float goldValue = sQuestData->CalculateGoldValue(quest);

      // goldValue now contains the calculated gold reward for quest 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion processing to determine
    the final gold reward amount. The calculation may vary based on server configuration
    settings such as difficulty modifiers or expansion-specific adjustments. Performance-wise,
    this method should be lightweight as it only performs mathematical calculations
    and does not involve database access.
  warnings: This method assumes that the provided Quest pointer is valid and properly
    initialized. Passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. Additionally, the returned gold value may not reflect real-time adjustments
    made by server-side quest modifiers or player-specific factors like reputation
    bonuses.
