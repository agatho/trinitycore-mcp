documentation:
  brief: Calculates the competitive price for an item in the auction house based on
    market dynamics and item properties.
  description: The CalculateCompetitivePrice method determines the optimal auction
    price for a given item by analyzing current market conditions, item value, and
    auction house dynamics. This method is typically used when listing items on the
    auction house to ensure competitive pricing that maximizes seller profit while
    attracting buyers. The calculation considers factors such as item rarity, base
    value, market demand, and previous auction activity. It returns a price in copper
    coins that reflects the item's market competitiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to calculate the competitive
      price. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: stackSize
    description: The number of items in the stack being auctioned. Affects the final
      calculated price, as larger stacks may have different pricing dynamics.
  returns: Returns the competitive price for the specified item and stack size in
    copper coins. The value represents the recommended listing price that balances
    market competitiveness with seller profit.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate price for a single common sword
    code: 'uint32 price = auctionHouse->CalculateCompetitivePrice(12345, 1); // Item
      ID for common sword

      printf("Recommended auction price: %u copper\n", price);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate price for a stack of rare potions
    code: "uint32 price = auctionHouse->CalculateCompetitivePrice(67890, 20); // Item\
      \ ID for rare potion, stack of 20\nif (price > 0) {\n    printf(\"Recommended\
      \ price for 20 potions: %u copper\\n\", price);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to calculate competitive price\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house databases and market
    analysis algorithms. Performance may be impacted when called frequently during
    bulk item listings. The calculation is typically performed asynchronously or cached
    for efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId corresponds to a valid item in the database, as invalid
    IDs may lead to incorrect pricing calculations. The returned price should not
    be used directly without additional validation for critical auction listings.
