documentation:
  brief: Updates the Mage AI's buff management state based on current spell availability
    and target conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing the casting and
    maintenance of beneficial spells (buffs) for a Mage AI character. It evaluates
    the current state of the Mage's buffs, checks if any are missing or expiring,
    and determines whether to cast new buffs or refresh existing ones based on predefined
    conditions such as target health, mana levels, and spell cooldowns. This method
    typically runs during each AI update cycle to ensure optimal spell usage for the
    Mage's performance in combat or non-combat scenarios.

    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI's update loop to maintain
    proper buff states. It may interact with internal spell queues and cooldown tracking
    systems, so performance is important for frequent calls.
