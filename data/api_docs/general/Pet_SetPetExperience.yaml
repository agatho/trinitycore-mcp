  signature: void Pet::SetPetExperience(uint32 xp)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the experience value for the pet, updating its current experience points.
  description: The SetPetExperience method updates the experience points of a pet
    entity within the TrinityCore framework. This method directly modifies the internal
    experience tracking of the pet, which affects its level progression and associated
    stats. The experience value is typically derived from combat encounters or quest
    rewards and is used to determine when the pet levels up. This method does not
    validate the input experience value against current pet level requirements; it
    simply assigns the provided value. The update may trigger internal recalculations
    of pet stats and level progression if the new experience exceeds the threshold
    for the next level.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The experience points to assign to the pet. This value should be
      a non-negative integer representing the total experience gained by the pet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      myPet->SetPetExperience(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Experience Based on Combat
    code: "uint32 experienceGained = 500;\nPet* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet)\n\
      {\n    pet->SetPetExperience(pet->GetPetExperience() + experienceGained);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the pet's experience without triggering level-up
    logic internally. If you need to ensure proper level progression, consider calling
    Pet::GiveXP or similar methods that handle level advancement. The method assumes
    that the provided experience value is valid and does not perform bounds checking
    on the input.
  warnings: Directly setting experience may bypass normal game progression rules.
    Ensure that experience values are appropriate for the pet's current level to avoid
    unexpected behavior or exploits. This method should be used carefully in custom
    scripts or modifications.
