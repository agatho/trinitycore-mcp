  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ExecuteImmediateTurnInStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteImmediateTurnInStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an immediate quest turn-in strategy for a specified player bot.
  description: The ExecuteImmediateTurnInStrategy method processes and completes quest
    turn-ins for a given player bot immediately, bypassing normal quest progression
    checks. This method is typically used in AI-driven quest completion systems where
    automated quest submission is required. It evaluates the bot's current quest state,
    identifies available turn-in opportunities, and executes the necessary actions
    to submit quests. The method assumes that all prerequisites for quest completion
    have already been met by the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest turn-in strategy. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Execution
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteImmediateTurnInStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot has all required quest items
    and meets the conditions for immediate turn-in. It does not perform validation
    checks on quest eligibility or item availability.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the bot object is properly initialized before invoking this
    method.
