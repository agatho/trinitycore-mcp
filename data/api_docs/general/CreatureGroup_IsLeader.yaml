  class: CreatureGroup
  method: IsLeader
  signature: bool CreatureGroup::IsLeader(const Creature * creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified creature is the leader of its creature group.
  description: The IsLeader method checks if a given creature is designated as the
    leader within its associated creature group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    creatures can form groups with specific leadership structures where one creature
    acts as the leader and others follow or respond to its behavior. This method is
    commonly used during AI processing to determine group dynamics and coordination
    behaviors. The method performs a comparison against the internal leader reference
    stored within the CreatureGroup object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified creature is the leader of the group; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature is the group leader
    code: "Creature* myCreature = ...;\nCreatureGroup* group = myCreature->GetCreatureGroup();\n\
      if (group && group->IsLeader(myCreature)) {\n    // This creature is the leader\
      \ of its group\n    // Execute leader-specific behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CreatureGroup object has been properly initialized
    and that the provided creature pointer is valid. The implementation relies on
    internal group state tracking which may be updated during group formation or member
    changes.
