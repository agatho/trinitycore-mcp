documentation:
  brief: Destroys the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the manager.
    This method is automatically invoked when an instance of QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation
    to prevent memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework's quest objective criteria
    system. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no explicit actions
    beyond standard object cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* mgr = new QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use mgr ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle management and
    should not be called directly unless explicitly deleting an object. The QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
    class likely manages criteria data related to quest objectives in World of Warcraft,
    such as tracking progress towards completing specific tasks or conditions within
    quests.
