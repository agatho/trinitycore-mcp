  brief: Teaches player custom spells that are not normally available through standard

    that require specific conditions or prerequisites to be unlocked. The method is
    commonly used in custom scripts or expansions where players need access to additional
    content beyond normal gameplay. This method does not return any value and is typically
    invoked as part of a larger player initialization or quest completion process.

    content being added.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to missing or incorrect spell learning,
    potentially affecting gameplay balance or quest completion. Care should be taken
    when using this method in custom scripts or expansions.
