  signature: void InstanceScript::ResetAreaTriggerDone(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the done status of an area trigger in the instance script.
  description: The ResetAreaTriggerDone method clears the completion flag for a specified
    area trigger within the instance. This allows the area trigger to be activated
    again, typically used when resetting a dungeon or raid encounter. The method operates
    on the unique identifier of the area trigger and ensures that any related quest
    objectives or encounter states are properly reset. This is commonly called during
    instance reset procedures or when players leave and re-enter an instance.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the area trigger to reset. This corresponds
      to the AreaTrigger ID used in the database and must match a valid area trigger
      defined in the instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a single area trigger
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    // Reset area\
      \ trigger with ID 12345 when player enters\n    ResetAreaTriggerDone(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset multiple area triggers during instance reset
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::Reset()\n{\n    // Reset all relevant area triggers\
      \ during instance reset\n    ResetAreaTriggerDone(1001);\n    ResetAreaTriggerDone(1002);\n\
      \    ResetAreaTriggerDone(1003);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other instance reset mechanisms.
    It's important to ensure that the area trigger ID passed matches a valid area
    trigger defined in the instance. The method does not directly affect quest states
    or NPC behavior, only the area trigger's completion status.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent area trigger ID may result in undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the ID corresponds to a legitimate area trigger within
    the instance before calling this method.
