documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes plot finalize game object information for garrisons.
  description: The LoadPlotFinalizeGOInfo method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all game object information related to plot finalization within garrison systems.
    This method likely retrieves data from database tables or configuration files
    that define how plot finalize objects (such as buildings or structures) should
    be handled in the garrison system. It prepares necessary data structures and ensures
    that all required game objects are properly registered for use during garrison
    operations, particularly those related to completing or finalizing plots within
    a player's garrison. The method is typically invoked during server startup or
    garrison initialization phases to ensure proper setup of garrison plot finalize
    mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'GarrisonMgr::instance()->LoadPlotFinalizeGOInfo();

      // Called during server startup to initialize garrison plot finalize objects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the garrison system initialization process
    and should be called before any garrison operations that might require plot finalization
    functionality. The method may involve database queries and data structure population
    that could impact startup time.
