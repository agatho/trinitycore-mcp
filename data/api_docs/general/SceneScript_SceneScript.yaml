  method: SceneScript
  signature: void SceneScript::SceneScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SceneScript instance with the specified name for managing in-game
    scene sequences.
  description: The SceneScript constructor initializes a new scene script instance
    with the provided name. This method sets up the internal state required to manage
    and execute scene sequences within the TrinityCore framework. Scene scripts are
    used to control cinematic events, quest sequences, and other scripted gameplay
    elements that involve multiple actors or environmental effects. The name parameter
    serves as a unique identifier for the scene script, allowing it to be referenced
    and managed by the game's scripting system. This constructor is typically called
    during server initialization or when dynamically creating new scene scripts at
    runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique name identifier
      for this scene script. This name must be unique within the scope of active scene
      scripts and is used to reference this specific script instance throughout the
      game's lifecycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SceneScript Initialization
    code: "class MyQuestScene : public SceneScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyQuestScene()\
      \ : SceneScript(\"MyQuestCinematic\")\n    {\n        // Scene script initialized\
      \ with name \"MyQuestCinematic\"\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: SceneScript with Dynamic Name Assignment
    code: "void InitializeCustomScene(const char* sceneName)\n{\n    SceneScript*\
      \ customScene = new SceneScript(sceneName);\n    // Use the scene script for\
      \ cinematic events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SceneScript constructor does not perform any validation on the input
    name parameter. It is recommended to use descriptive and unique names to avoid
    conflicts with other scene scripts in the system. The constructor should only
    be called during object construction, as modifying the name after initialization
    may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on already initialized SceneScript
    objects as it may cause memory leaks or corruption. Ensure that scene script names
    are unique and do not contain special characters that might interfere with internal
    string handling. Avoid calling this constructor from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
