  class: DB2Manager
  method: InsertNewHotfix
  signature: void DB2Manager::InsertNewHotfix(uint32 tableHash, uint32 recordId)
documentation:
  brief: Inserts a new hotfix record for the specified table hash and record ID into
    the database.
  description: The InsertNewHotfix method is used to register a new hotfix entry in
    the database for a specific table and record. This functionality is typically
    utilized within the TrinityCore framework to manage dynamic data modifications
    that can be applied without requiring a full server restart. The method takes
    a table hash, which identifies the DB2 table structure, and a record ID, which
    specifies the particular record within that table to be modified. Hotfixes are
    commonly used for patching game content, adjusting values, or applying temporary
    changes during development or live server maintenance. The operation is generally
    performed as part of the hotfix system's workflow where changes are queued and
    applied at appropriate times.
  parameters:
  - name: tableHash
    description: A unique hash value representing the DB2 table structure to which
      the hotfix applies. This hash is typically generated from the table name or
      structure definition.
  - name: recordId
    description: The identifier of the specific record within the DB2 table that will
      be modified by this hotfix. This corresponds to the primary key or unique identifier
      for the record in the database.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the hotfix management system and should be called
    when a new hotfix needs to be registered. It does not apply changes immediately
    but rather queues them for processing by the hotfix manager. The tableHash must
    correspond to an existing DB2 table in the database schema, otherwise the operation
    may fail silently or cause errors during hotfix application.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid tableHash or recordId values can lead
    to data inconsistency or runtime errors. Ensure that the provided parameters reference
    valid database structures and records before invoking this function. Improper
    usage may result in failed hotfix applications or corrupted data states.
