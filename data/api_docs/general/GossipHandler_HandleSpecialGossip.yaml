  class: GossipHandler

  signature: bool GossipHandler::HandleSpecialGossip(::Player * bot, const GossipMenuOption
    & option)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a special gossip option for a player character within the TrinityCore
    WoW emulation environment.
  description: The HandleSpecialGossip method is responsible for executing specific
    actions or behaviors when a player selects a special gossip menu option in the
    World of Warcraft emulation. This function typically handles unique interactions
    that are not part of standard quest or vendor gossip flows, such as special NPC
    dialogues, custom scripted events, or unique character interactions. The method
    takes a Player object and a GossipMenuOption structure to determine how to process
    the selected option. It returns true if the gossip interaction was successfully
    handled, false otherwise. This method is commonly used in AI scripts or custom
    modules where NPCs need to perform non-standard actions based on player choices.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who initiated
      the gossip interaction. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid player instance within the game world.
  - name: option
    description: Reference to a GossipMenuOption structure containing details about
      the selected gossip option, including its ID, text, and associated actions.
      The structure typically holds information such as the option's menu ID, display
      text, and any special flags or data needed for processing.
  returns: Returns true if the special gossip option was successfully processed and
    handled by the method; returns false if the option could not be processed or if
    an error occurred during handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleSpecialGossip
    code: "bool result = handler->HandleSpecialGossip(player, gossipOption);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Gossip was handled successfully\n    player->SendGossipMenu(12345,\
      \ player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to handle gossip\n\
      \    player->SendGossipMenu(0, player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main gossip handling flow
    of the TrinityCore server. Developers should ensure that any custom logic implemented
    in this function does not block the game thread for extended periods. The GossipMenuOption
    structure may contain additional metadata that can be used to determine specific
    behaviors, such as quest requirements or player state checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and that the GossipMenuOption
    contains valid data before calling this method. Improper handling of invalid pointers
    or malformed option data can lead to crashes or undefined behavior in the server.
