documentation:
  brief: Loads faction change title data from the database into memory for use in
    player faction switching mechanics.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeTitles method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with faction change title information retrieved from the database.
    This data is used to determine which titles players receive when they switch factions
    in World of Warcraft. The method typically executes during server startup or database
    reload operations. It reads title mappings from the appropriate database tables
    and stores them in memory for fast lookup during player faction change events.
    The loaded titles are associated with specific faction IDs and represent the rewards
    players receive upon completing faction changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadFactionChangeTitles();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reload operations. The loaded data is used by the faction change system to determine
    which titles should be granted to players when they switch factions. It's important
    that this method is called before any faction change operations occur to ensure
    proper title assignment.
