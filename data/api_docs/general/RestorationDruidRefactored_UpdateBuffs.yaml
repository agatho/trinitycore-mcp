documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff effects on the Restoration Druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buff effects to a Restoration Druid character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically iterates through the druid's active buffs, checks their
    duration and validity, and applies any necessary game mechanics such as stat modifications,
    healing bonuses, or spell enhancements. It ensures that the character's state
    remains consistent with their current buff stack and cooldowns. The method is
    commonly invoked during combat updates, tick intervals, or when new buffs are
    applied to maintain accurate gameplay behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void RestorationDruid::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // ... other combat\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... continue with combat updates ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Effect Application
    code: "void RestorationDruid::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n   \
      \ // Apply spell effects\n    if (spellInfo->Id == 774) // Rejuvenation\n  \
      \  {\n        // ... apply buff logic ...\n        UpdateBuffs(); // Ensure\
      \ buffs are refreshed after application\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during regular update cycles to maintain
    accurate buff states. It may internally handle debuff removal, stat recalculations,
    and aura updates. Performance-wise, this method should avoid heavy computations
    as it's likely called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate update contexts (e.g., during
    spell casting or movement) might cause inconsistent state updates or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that all buff-related logic is properly synchronized with the
    game's main update loop.
