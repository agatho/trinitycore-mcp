documentation:
  brief: Sets the artifact experience points for the item
  description: This method assigns a specified amount of artifact experience points
    to an item, which is used in World of Warcraft's artifact system. The method updates
    the internal artifact XP value stored within the item object, allowing players
    to progress through artifact power levels and unlock artifact abilities. This
    functionality is crucial for managing artifact progression and ensuring proper
    item behavior during artifact upgrades.

  - title: Basic Artifact XP Setting Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetArtifactXP(1000);

      // Sets artifact experience points to 1000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's artifact XP field, which is typically
    used in conjunction with other artifact-related methods such as GetArtifactXP
    or SetArtifactRarity. The method should be called during appropriate artifact
    progression events or when handling artifact items that require experience updates.
  warnings: Care must be taken when setting artifact XP values, as incorrect values
    can lead to improper artifact progression or display issues. Ensure the XP value
    is within valid ranges for the artifact system and consider potential game mechanics
    implications.
