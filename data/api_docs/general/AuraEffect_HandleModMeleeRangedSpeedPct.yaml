  method: HandleModMeleeRangedSpeedPct
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModMeleeRangedSpeedPct(const AuraApplication *
    aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies melee and ranged attack speed percentage for the affected unit.
  description: The HandleModMeleeRangedSpeedPct method is responsible for adjusting
    the melee and ranged attack speed of a unit affected by an aura. This method is
    typically invoked during aura application or removal to modify the unit's attack
    speed statistics. It adjusts both melee and ranged attack speeds simultaneously,
    which can be used for various game effects such as slowing or speeding up attacks.
    The modification is applied based on the aura's specified percentage value and
    is handled through the AuraApplication context.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter provides context for how the
      speed modification should be applied.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating whether the effect is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This value determines the direction of the speed
      adjustment.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). Controls the actual application logic for the speed modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Melee and Ranged Speed Reduction Aura
    code: "void ApplySpeedReductionAura(Unit* target, float percentage)\n{\n    AuraApplication*\
      \ auraApp = new AuraApplication(target, target, nullptr);\n    AuraEffect* effect\
      \ = new AuraEffect();\n    effect->HandleModMeleeRangedSpeedPct(auraApp, 0,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and directly
    affects combat performance. It modifies internal attack speed values that are
    used during combat calculations. The method should only be called from within
    the aura application framework.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method without proper AuraApplication context
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect attack speed modifications. Ensure
    that the aura application is properly initialized before calling this method.
