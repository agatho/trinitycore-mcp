  brief: Advances the startup spawn phase to the next stage in the initialization
    sequence
  description: The ForceNextPhase method is used to manually advance the startup spawn
    orchestrator to the next phase of the world object initialization process. This
    method bypasses normal phase progression and forces an immediate transition to
    the subsequent phase, which can be useful for debugging or when specific conditions
    need to be met before proceeding with spawns. The method operates within the context
    of TrinityCore's startup sequence where various game objects are initialized in
    a controlled order to ensure proper dependencies are satisfied. It is typically
    invoked during server startup or when reloading certain systems that require explicit
    phase control.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Forcing next spawn phase during server initialization
    code: "void MyCustomStartupHandler()\n{\n    StartupSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetStartupSpawnOrchestrator();\n    if (orchestrator)\n    {\n\
      \        orchestrator->ForceNextPhase();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal phase progression
    logic. It may cause issues if called at inappropriate times during the startup
    sequence, potentially leading to uninitialized dependencies or inconsistent object
    states. The method is primarily intended for internal use and debugging purposes.
  warnings: Calling ForceNextPhase outside of appropriate initialization contexts
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required systems are
    properly initialized before calling this method. Avoid using this in production
    code unless absolutely necessary as it may interfere with normal startup sequence
    flow.
