  class: AreaTrigger
  method: UpdatePolygonVertices
  signature: void AreaTrigger::UpdatePolygonVertices()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the polygon vertices of the area trigger based on its current shape
    and size parameters.
  description: The UpdatePolygonVertices method recalculates and updates the vertex
    positions that define the polygonal boundary of an AreaTrigger object. This method
    is typically invoked when the area trigger's dimensions, shape, or position have
    changed, ensuring that the underlying collision detection and event triggering
    logic operates correctly. It is essential for maintaining accurate spatial representation
    of area triggers such as those used in raid encounters, quest zones, or environmental
    effects. The method internally processes the current configuration of the area
    trigger to generate updated vertex data suitable for use in spatial queries and
    collision detection systems.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->UpdatePolygonVertices();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core when area trigger
    properties change, but may also be invoked manually during custom scripting or
    debugging. It performs calculations that depend on the current shape type (e.g.,
    circle, rectangle, polygon) and associated parameters.
  warnings: Invoking this method frequently without proper conditions can lead to
    performance degradation due to repeated vertex calculations. Ensure that updates
    are only performed when necessary.
