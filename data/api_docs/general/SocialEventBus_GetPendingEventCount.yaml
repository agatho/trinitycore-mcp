  class: SocialEventBus
  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 SocialEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending social events currently queued in the event
    bus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the total count of social
    events that are currently awaiting processing within the SocialEventBus. This
    count includes all events that have been submitted to the bus but have not yet
    been dispatched or handled. The method is typically used for monitoring and debugging
    purposes, allowing developers to track the workload of the social event system.
    It provides a snapshot of the current queue size at the time of the call, which
    can be useful for performance tuning and identifying potential bottlenecks in
    event handling. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to
    call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending social events in the
    queue. Returns zero if no events are currently pending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = sSocialEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"social\", \"There are {} pending social events.\"\
      , pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Event Queue Size
    code: "void MonitorSocialEventQueue()\n{\n    uint32 count = sSocialEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 100)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"social\", \"High social\
      \ event queue load detected: {} events pending.\", count);\n    }\n    else\
      \ if (count == 0)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"social\", \"Social event queue\
      \ is empty.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the internal event counter.
    The returned value represents a momentary snapshot and may change immediately
    after the call. For performance-critical applications, consider caching this value
    rather than calling it repeatedly in tight loops.
  warnings: The returned count only reflects events that are currently queued for
    processing and does not include events that may be actively being processed by
    other threads. This method should not be used as a synchronization mechanism;
    it is purely informational.
