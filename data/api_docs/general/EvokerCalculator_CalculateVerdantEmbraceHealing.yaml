  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateVerdantEmbraceHealing(int * caster, int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the healing amount for the Verdant Embrace ability based on caster
    and target stats.
  description: The CalculateVerdantEmbraceHealing method computes the healing value
    generated by the Evoker's Verdant Embrace spell. This ability typically heals
    the caster and nearby allies based on the caster's healing power and the target's
    health deficit. The calculation involves assessing the caster's stats, such as
    spell power or healing modifiers, and applying relevant multipliers or scaling
    factors. It is used within the combat system to determine how much life is restored
    during the execution of this ability. This method assumes valid input parameters
    representing the caster and target entities.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's stats or identifier.
      Expected to contain relevant healing modifiers or spell power values.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's stats or identifier.
      Used to determine health deficit or scaling factors for the healing calculation.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated healing amount. A
    positive integer indicates the total healing done; zero or negative values may
    indicate no healing or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int casterStats = 1000;

      int targetStats = 500;

      int healingDone = calculator.CalculateVerdantEmbraceHealing(&casterStats, &targetStats);

      // healingDone now holds the calculated healing value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "int* caster = new int(1200);\nint* target = new int(800);\nint result =\
      \ calculator.CalculateVerdantEmbraceHealing(caster, target);\nif (result > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Apply healing to target\n    target[0] += result;\n}\ndelete caster;\n\
      delete target;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal scaling factors and game balance constants
    specific to the Evoker class. Developers should ensure that the input values pointed
    to by caster and target are valid and represent appropriate stat representations
    for accurate healing calculations.
  warnings: Passing null pointers or invalid stat values can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect healing amounts. Always validate inputs before calling this method.
