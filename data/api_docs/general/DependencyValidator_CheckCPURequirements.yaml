  class: DependencyValidator
  method: CheckCPURequirements
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::CheckCPURequirements()
documentation:
  brief: Validates that the system's CPU meets the minimum requirements for running
    TrinityCore.
  description: The CheckCPURequirements method performs a runtime validation of the
    system's Central Processing Unit to ensure it meets the minimum specifications
    required by the TrinityCore server. This function typically checks for supported
    instruction sets, processor architecture compatibility, and minimum clock speeds.
    The method is part of the dependency validation suite that ensures the server
    environment is properly configured before initialization. It returns true if all
    CPU requirements are satisfied, or false if any requirement is not met. This check
    is crucial for preventing runtime errors due to unsupported hardware configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the system's CPU meets all minimum requirements, false
    otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the server may not function
    properly or may fail to start due to insufficient CPU capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "if (!DependencyValidator::CheckCPURequirements()) {\n    std::cerr << \"\
      CPU requirements not met. Server cannot start.\" << std::endl;\n    return false;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with server startup if CPU checks pass"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform hardware detection operations that could impact startup
    time on systems with slower CPU detection routines. The validation typically occurs
    during server boot sequence before any game logic is initialized.
  warnings: If this method returns false, the TrinityCore server will likely fail
    to start or exhibit unstable behavior. It's recommended to check system specifications
    against documented requirements before running the server.
