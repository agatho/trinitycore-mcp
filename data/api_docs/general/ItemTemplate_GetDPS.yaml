documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage per second (DPS) for an item based on its
    item level.
  description: The GetDPS method computes the estimated damage per second that an
    item will deal, taking into account the item's level and other relevant properties.
    This value is typically used in game calculations to determine weapon effectiveness,
    compare gear, or calculate combat performance. The method accepts a single parameter
    representing the item level, which influences how the DPS is calculated. It's
    important to note that this calculation may vary depending on the item type (e.g.,
    melee vs. ranged weapons) and other factors such as enchantments or bonuses applied
    to the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated damage per second for the item
    at the specified item level. Returns zero if the item cannot be evaluated or if
    invalid parameters are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float dps = itemTemplate->GetDPS(80);

      printf("DPS: %.2f\n", dps);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Calculation
    code: 'ItemTemplate* weapon = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_INV_SLOT_1));

      float weaponDPS = weapon->GetDPS(player->GetLevel());

      float totalDPS = weaponDPS + bonusDPS;

      // Use totalDPS in combat calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal item data and assumes valid item templates.
    The DPS calculation may be influenced by additional factors like enchantments,
    gem bonuses, or class-specific modifiers not directly handled within this function.
    Ensure that the item level passed is valid to avoid unexpected results.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized item templates;
    doing so may result in undefined behavior or incorrect DPS values. Also, be aware
    that the returned value represents an estimated DPS and may not reflect real-time
    changes during combat.
