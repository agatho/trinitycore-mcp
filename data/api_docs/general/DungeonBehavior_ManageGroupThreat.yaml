    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Manages threat distribution and group behavior during dungeon encounters.
  description: The ManageGroupThreat method handles the dynamic threat management
    within a dungeon group during encounter events. It ensures that threat is properly
    distributed among group members based on their engagement with the current encounter,
    maintaining proper combat balance and preventing individual players from accumulating
    excessive threat. This method integrates with the dungeon's encounter system to
    dynamically adjust group behavior and maintain optimal gameplay flow.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group currently
      engaged in the encounter. Must be a valid group pointer, typically obtained
      from the dungeon instance.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object describing the current encounter
      state and parameters. Contains information about active mobs, phase transitions,
      and threat-related encounter data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Management Call
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.ManageGroupThreat(group, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Threat Handling with Custom Logic
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::HandleEncounterUpdate(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    // Pre-processing\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_BOSS)\n\
      \    {\n        // Adjust threat distribution for boss encounters\n        dungeonBehavior.ManageGroupThreat(group,\
      \ encounter);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle regular mob encounters\n\
      \        dungeonBehavior.ManageGroupThreat(group, encounter);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during encounter state transitions and should
    be invoked after any significant change in group engagement with the encounter.
    The implementation may adjust player threat levels, modify aggro targets, and
    ensure balanced combat distribution across group members.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. The DungeonEncounter parameter must accurately reflect
    the current encounter state for proper threat management.
