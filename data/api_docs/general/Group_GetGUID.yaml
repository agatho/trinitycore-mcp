  method: GetGUID
  signature: int Group::GetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the group
  description: The GetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier assigned
    to this group instance. In TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, every group
    object is associated with a unique GUID that distinguishes it from all other groups
    in the game world. This identifier is used internally by the server for tracking
    group membership, managing group-related operations, and ensuring proper synchronization
    between clients and the server. The method is read-only and does not modify any
    internal state of the group object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique GUID identifier of this group
    instance. This GUID is guaranteed to be unique across all groups in the game world
    and can be used for direct lookup or comparison operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve group GUID
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int groupId = group->GetGUID();\n\
      \    // Use groupId for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID in group management operations
    code: "void HandleGroupCommand(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        int groupId = group->GetGUID();\n        //\
      \ Log or store the group ID for later reference\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %s is in group with GUID: %d\", player->GetName(), groupId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is assigned when the group is created and remains constant
    throughout the group's lifetime. This method is thread-safe as it only reads from
    immutable data members of the Group class.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns an integer type, which may not be sufficient
    for very large world instances. However, in standard TrinityCore configurations,
    this limitation does not typically occur.
