  class: TerrainInfo
  method: ExistVMap
  signature: bool TerrainInfo::ExistVMap(uint32 mapid, int32 gx, int32 gy)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a VMap (Virtual Map) exists for the specified map and grid
    coordinates.
  description: The ExistVMap method determines if a Virtual Map tile is available
    for the given map ID and grid coordinates. This functionality is essential for
    determining whether terrain data, including height maps and collision information,
    is loaded and accessible for navigation and gameplay mechanics. The method typically
    checks internal VMap caches or file systems to verify the presence of map data
    before allowing operations that depend on it. It's commonly used in pathfinding,
    line-of-sight calculations, and object placement logic within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: The unique identifier of the map (e.g., 0 for Eastern Kingdoms, 1
      for Kalimdor). Valid values are defined by the game's map database.
  - name: gx
    description: The grid X coordinate (typically ranging from 0 to 63 for standard
      maps). Represents the horizontal grid position within the map.
  - name: gy
    description: The grid Y coordinate (typically ranging from 0 to 63 for standard
      maps). Represents the vertical grid position within the map.
  returns: Returns true if a VMap tile exists for the specified map and grid coordinates,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the grid is outside
    valid map boundaries or that the VMap data has not been loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Check if VMap exists at specific grid coordinates
    code: "if (TerrainInfo::ExistVMap(0, 10, 15)) {\n    // Proceed with operations\
      \ requiring VMap data\n    printf(\"VMap exists at grid (10, 15)\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where VMap is not available\n    printf(\"No VMap data\
      \ for grid (10, 15)\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in pathfinding pre-check
    code: "bool CanNavigate(uint32 mapId, int32 xGrid, int32 yGrid) {\n    // Pre-check\
      \ if VMap exists before attempting navigation\n    if (!TerrainInfo::ExistVMap(mapId,\
      \ xGrid, yGrid)) {\n        return false; // Cannot navigate without VMap data\n\
      \    }\n    // Proceed with pathfinding logic\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive as it may trigger file I/O or cache
    lookups depending on how VMap data is managed. It's recommended to cache results
    when checking multiple grids in sequence. The method assumes valid map IDs and
    grid coordinates, though invalid inputs might result in undefined behavior or
    false negatives.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid map IDs or out-of-bounds grid coordinates
    may lead to incorrect results or internal errors. Always validate input parameters
    before calling this function. Be cautious when using it in high-frequency loops
    as repeated checks can impact performance.
