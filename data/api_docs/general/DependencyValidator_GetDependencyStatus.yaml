  class: DependencyValidator
  method: GetDependencyStatus
  signature: std::vector<DependencyInfo> DependencyValidator::GetDependencyStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current status of all registered dependencies within the system
  description: The GetDependencyStatus method returns a vector containing detailed
    information about the current state of all dependencies managed by the DependencyValidator.
    This includes whether each dependency is satisfied, missing, or in an error state.
    The returned DependencyInfo objects provide comprehensive details about each dependency's
    status, version, and any associated error messages. This method is typically used
    during system initialization or health checks to ensure all required components
    are properly loaded and functional before proceeding with operations that depend
    on them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<DependencyInfo> containing the status information for each
    registered dependency. Each DependencyInfo object includes details such as dependency
    name, version, status (satisfied, missing, error), and any relevant error messages
    or metadata.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check System Dependencies
    code: "DependencyValidator validator;\nstd::vector<DependencyInfo> dependencies\
      \ = validator.GetDependencyStatus();\nfor (const auto& dep : dependencies) {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Dependency: \" << dep.name << \" - Status: \" << dep.status\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a snapshot of current dependency states and does not
    actively check or update dependencies. The returned vector is a copy of the internal
    state, so modifications to the returned objects do not affect the actual dependency
    tracking. Consider caching results if this method is called frequently in performance-critical
    sections.
  warnings: The method may return an empty vector if no dependencies have been registered
    with the validator. Always verify that the returned vector contains expected entries
    before processing, especially in systems where dependency registration might be
    conditional or deferred.
