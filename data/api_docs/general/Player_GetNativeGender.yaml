documentation:
  brief: Returns the native gender of the player, which determines the character's
    biological sex in the game world.
  description: The GetNativeGender method retrieves the native gender of a Player
    object, which represents the character's biological sex as defined by the game
    mechanics. This value is typically used to determine the character's appearance
    and behavior in the game world, including voice, skin tone, and other visual characteristics.
    The method returns an integer representing the gender, where 0 indicates male,
    1 indicates female, and 2 indicates none (for neutral or other gender types).
    This information is crucial for determining how a player's character appears and
    behaves in various game contexts, such as NPC interactions, quest progression,
    and gender-specific dialogue.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the native gender of the player.
    The value can be 0 for male, 1 for female, or 2 for neutral/other gender types.
    This value corresponds to the game's gender enum values and is used internally
    by TrinityCore to determine character appearance and behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int gender = player->GetNativeGender();\nif (gender == 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is male\n}\nelse if (gender == 1)\n{\n    // Player is female\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Player is neutral or other gender\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other gender-related methods. The return value is consistent across all player
    instances and does not change during gameplay unless the character's gender is
    modified through game mechanics or events.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when determining character appearance,
    as incorrect handling can lead to visual inconsistencies in the game world. The
    returned value may not always reflect the actual gender of the character if the
    player has undergone gender changes through game events or quests.
