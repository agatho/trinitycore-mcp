  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: GetDispelAssignment
  signature: DispelAssignment DispelCoordinator::GetDispelAssignment() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current dispel assignment configuration from the DispelCoordinator.
  description: The GetDispelAssignment method returns the active dispel assignment
    object that defines how dispels are coordinated within the system. This typically
    includes information about which dispel types are allowed, priority levels, and
    any restrictions or conditions applied to dispel operations. The returned object
    represents the current state of dispel coordination settings and can be used by
    other systems to determine appropriate dispel behavior. This method is commonly
    used in spell handling and aura management systems where dispel mechanics need
    to be dynamically evaluated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DispelAssignment object containing the current dispel coordination configuration,
    including dispel types, priorities, and restrictions. Returns a valid DispelAssignment
    object with default values if no specific assignment has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DispelAssignment assignment = coordinator.GetDispelAssignment();\nif (assignment.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the dispel assignment\n    std::cout << \"Dispel type: \"\
      \ << assignment.GetType() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell System
    code: "void HandleDispelSpell(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    DispelAssignment\
      \ assignment = coordinator.GetDispelAssignment();\n    if (assignment.CanDispel(target->GetAuraType()))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with dispel logic\n        target->RemoveAura(assignment.GetDispelType());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. The returned
    DispelAssignment object should not be modified directly as changes may affect
    the global dispel coordination state. Consider caching the result if the assignment
    is accessed frequently within a single operation.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on the return value for critical gameplay decisions,
    as the assignment may change dynamically during runtime. Ensure proper validation
    of the returned object before using its contents to avoid unexpected behavior.
