documentation:
  brief: Updates the shock rotation logic for the shaman AI, managing the timing and
    execution of shock spells.
  description: The UpdateShockRotation method is responsible for controlling the casting
    behavior of shock spells within the ShamanAI class. This method evaluates the
    current state of the shaman's target, checks for valid spell conditions, and manages
    the rotation of shock abilities such as Lightning Bolt or Chain Lightning. It
    ensures that shocks are cast at optimal intervals based on combat mechanics and
    cooldowns. The method typically integrates with the AI's overall decision-making
    process to maintain effective spell usage during combat encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateShockRotation();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the shaman's spell cooldown tracking and
    target selection systems. It may be called periodically during the AI update cycle
    to maintain optimal spell rotation timing.
