documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the spell priority list for a Mage AI based on current combat state
    and available mana.
  description: The OptimizeSpellPriorities method dynamically adjusts the order of
    spells in a Mage's AI spell priority list to maximize damage output or survivability
    depending on the current combat situation. It evaluates factors such as available
    mana, target health, spell cooldowns, and encounter mechanics to determine the
    most effective sequence of spells to cast. This method is typically called during
    combat updates to ensure the Mage AI selects the optimal spell at any given moment.
    The optimization considers both immediate tactical needs (like applying debuffs
    or dealing burst damage) and long-term resource management (mana conservation).

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeSpellPriorities();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat updates to ensure optimal
    spell selection. It modifies internal spell priority data structures and does
    not return any value. The optimization process is based on heuristics that may
    vary depending on the specific Mage specialization (Arcane, Fire, Frost).
