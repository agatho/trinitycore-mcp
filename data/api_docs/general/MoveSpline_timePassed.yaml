  class: MoveSpline
  method: timePassed
  signature: int32 MoveSpline::timePassed() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elapsed time since the spline movement started.
  description: The timePassed method computes the amount of time that has elapsed
    since the MoveSpline object began its movement animation. This value is typically
    used to determine progress through a spline path, synchronize animations with
    movement, or calculate interpolation factors for smooth transitions. The returned
    value represents milliseconds and is derived from internal timing mechanisms within
    the spline system. This method is commonly utilized in movement-based game mechanics
    such as NPC pathfinding, player locomotion, or object animation systems where
    precise timing is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the number of milliseconds that have passed
    since the spline movement began. A negative value may indicate an uninitialized
    or invalid state, while zero typically means no time has elapsed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check movement progress
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = player->movespline;\nint32 elapsed = spline->timePassed();\n\
      if (elapsed > 1000) {\n    // More than 1 second has passed\n    // Continue\
      \ with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using timePassed for interpolation calculations
    code: 'MoveSpline* spline = unit->movespline;

      int32 elapsed = spline->timePassed();

      int32 totalDuration = spline->GetTotalTime();

      float progress = static_cast<float>(elapsed) / static_cast<float>(totalDuration);

      // Use ''progress'' for smooth interpolation between start and end positions'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal timing system of the MoveSpline class,
    which is typically synchronized with the game's frame rate. It should only be
    called after the spline has been initialized and started. The returned value may
    not be accurate if called before the first update cycle or in cases where the
    movement has been interrupted or reset.
  warnings: Do not assume that timePassed will always return increasing values; it
    can be reset or modified by external factors such as movement interruption or
    path changes. Also, calling this method on an uninitialized MoveSpline object
    may produce unpredictable results.
