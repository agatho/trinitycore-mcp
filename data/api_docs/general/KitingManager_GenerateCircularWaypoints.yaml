  class: KitingManager
  method: GenerateCircularWaypoints
  signature: int KitingManager::GenerateCircularWaypoints(Unit * target, float radius,
    uint32 points)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of circular waypoints around a target unit for kiting behavior.
  description: The GenerateCircularWaypoints method creates a series of evenly distributed
    waypoints in a circular pattern around a specified target unit. This functionality
    is typically used by AI-controlled creatures or players to perform kiting maneuvers,
    maintaining optimal distance from an enemy while moving in a circular path. The
    method calculates the positions based on the target's location, a given radius,
    and the number of desired waypoints. It returns the total count of generated waypoints,
    which can be used for subsequent pathfinding or movement logic.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object around which the circular waypoints will
      be generated. This represents the center point of the circle.
  - name: radius
    description: Floating-point value representing the radius of the circular path
      in yards. Determines how far from the target unit the waypoints are placed.
  - name: points
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer specifying the number of waypoints to generate
      along the circular path. Must be a positive value; typically between 4 and 36
      for practical kiting behavior.
  returns: An integer representing the total number of waypoints successfully generated.
    Returns 0 if the input parameters are invalid or insufficient memory is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Kiting AI
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint waypointCount = kitingManager->GenerateCircularWaypoints(target,\
      \ 10.0f, 8);\nif (waypointCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with path following logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Generated Waypoints for Movement
    code: "Unit* target = creature->GetVictim();\nuint32 numPoints = 12;\nfloat radius\
      \ = 15.0f;\nint count = kitingManager->GenerateCircularWaypoints(target, radius,\
      \ numPoints);\nif (count == static_cast<int>(numPoints)) {\n    // Pathfinding\
      \ logic using generated waypoints\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i)\
      \ {\n        Position waypoint = kitingManager->GetWaypoint(i);\n        creature->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(i,\
      \ waypoint);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible. The generated
    waypoints are stored internally within the KitingManager instance and can be retrieved
    using GetWaypoint() or similar accessors. Performance may degrade with very high
    point counts due to trigonometric calculations required for positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as it will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Also, avoid setting points
    to extremely large values (e.g., >100) which could lead to excessive memory usage
    or performance issues.
