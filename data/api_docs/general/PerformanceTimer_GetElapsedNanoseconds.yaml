  class: PerformanceTimer
  method: GetElapsedNanoseconds
  signature: uint64_t PerformanceTimer::GetElapsedNanoseconds() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elapsed time in nanoseconds since the performance
    timer was started.
  description: The GetElapsedNanoseconds method computes the total time that has passed
    since the PerformanceTimer instance was initialized or last reset. This method
    is commonly used for profiling, timing game events, or measuring performance metrics
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned value represents a high-resolution
    timestamp in nanoseconds, which can be used to calculate precise durations between
    operations. The timer must have been started previously via a corresponding Start()
    method call; otherwise, the result may be undefined or zero. This method is thread-safe
    and suitable for use in multi-threaded environments where accurate timing measurements
    are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the number of nanoseconds elapsed since the
    timer was started. If the timer has not been started, this may return zero or
    an undefined value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Usage
    code: 'PerformanceTimer timer;

      timer.Start();

      // ... some operations ...

      uint64_t elapsedNs = timer.GetElapsedNanoseconds();

      std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << elapsedNs << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Profiling Example
    code: "void SomeGameFunction() {\n    PerformanceTimer timer;\n    timer.Start();\n\
      \    // Simulate some work\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {\n      \
      \  // Do something\n    }\n    uint64_t nanoseconds = timer.GetElapsedNanoseconds();\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"performance\", \"Function took {} nanoseconds\", nanoseconds);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on high-resolution performance counters provided by the
    underlying operating system. It is recommended to use this for precise timing
    measurements rather than standard clock functions which may have lower resolution.
    The timer's accuracy depends on the platform and hardware capabilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceTimer has been properly started before calling
    GetElapsedNanoseconds, otherwise the result may not reflect actual elapsed time.
    Avoid using this method in performance-critical code paths without considering
    potential overhead from system calls.
