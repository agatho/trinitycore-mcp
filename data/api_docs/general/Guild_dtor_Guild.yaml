documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Guild object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Guild destructor is automatically invoked when a Guild object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup of all
    internal data structures, including member lists, guild permissions, and any dynamically
    allocated memory. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this destructor plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks when guilds are
    disbanded or removed from the game world. The destructor typically handles cleanup
    tasks such as removing references to players, clearing guild chat channels, and
    notifying the database layer to persist any final state changes before object
    destruction.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Guild object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    Guild* guild = new Guild();\n    // ... perform\
      \ operations with guild ...\n    delete guild; // Triggers ~Guild() destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated Guild destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    Guild guild;\n    // ... perform operations\
      \ with guild ...\n    // ~Guild() automatically called when guild goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to note that the Guild class likely maintains
    references to Player objects, so proper cleanup ensures no dangling pointers remain
    in the system. The destruction process may involve database operations to update
    guild status or member counts.
