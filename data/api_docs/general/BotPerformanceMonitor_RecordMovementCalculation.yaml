  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordMovementCalculation
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordMovementCalculation(uint32_t botGuid,
    uint64_t microseconds, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Records a movement calculation duration for a bot with associated context
    information.
  description: The RecordMovementCalculation method logs performance data for bot
    movement calculations by storing the time taken in microseconds along with contextual
    information. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI framework
    to monitor and analyze the efficiency of bot pathfinding and movement logic. The
    recorded data can be used for performance profiling, identifying bottlenecks,
    or optimizing bot behavior. The method accepts a bot's unique identifier, the
    duration of the calculation, and a descriptive context string that helps categorize
    or identify the specific type of movement operation being measured.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the movement
      calculation was performed. This value uniquely identifies the specific bot instance
      in the game world.
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time duration in microseconds that the movement calculation took
      to complete. This value represents the performance cost of the operation being
      measured.
  - name: context
    description: A descriptive string providing context about the movement calculation.
      This can be used to categorize or identify the type of movement operation, such
      as 'pathfinding', 'avoidance', or 'target_following'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance()->RecordMovementCalculation(12345, 4500,
      "pathfinding");
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Context
    code: 'std::string context = "avoidance" + std::to_string(botGuid % 10);

      BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance()->RecordMovementCalculation(botGuid, timeTaken,
      context);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a performance monitoring system that helps
    developers track how long various AI operations take. It's important to note that
    the microseconds parameter should represent actual measured execution time rather
    than estimated values. The implementation may use thread-safe data structures
    or logging mechanisms to ensure accurate recording across concurrent bot operations.
