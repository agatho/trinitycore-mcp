  class: IVMapManager
  method: setEnableLineOfSightCalc
  signature: void IVMapManager::setEnableLineOfSightCalc(bool pVal)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables line-of-sight calculation for the map manager.
  description: The setEnableLineOfSightCalc method controls whether the IVMapManager
    performs line-of-sight checks when determining visibility between points in the
    game world. This functionality is crucial for various game mechanics such as spell
    casting, NPC AI behavior, and player interaction with environment objects. When
    enabled, the system will evaluate whether a direct path exists between two points,
    taking into account obstacles like walls, terrain, and other solid objects. Disabling
    this feature can improve performance in scenarios where such calculations are
    not required, but may lead to unrealistic gameplay behaviors. The setting affects
    all subsequent operations involving visibility checks within the map manager's
    scope.
  parameters:
  - name: pVal
    description: Boolean value indicating whether line-of-sight calculation should
      be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Line-of-Sight Calculation
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = VMAP::VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      vmapManager->setEnableLineOfSightCalc(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Line-of-Sight Calculation for Performance
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = VMAP::VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      vmapManager->setEnableLineOfSightCalc(false); // Disable for performance optimization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This setting is typically used during server initialization or configuration
    changes. The change takes effect immediately for subsequent visibility checks,
    but may not affect already cached results. Performance impact is significant when
    enabled, as it requires additional computational resources to evaluate paths between
    points.
  warnings: Disabling line-of-sight calculations can cause spells and abilities to
    behave incorrectly if they rely on obstacle detection. This setting should be
    used carefully in production environments where realistic gameplay is required.
