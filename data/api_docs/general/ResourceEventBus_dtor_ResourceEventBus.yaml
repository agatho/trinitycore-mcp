documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ResourceEventBus instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The ~ResourceEventBus destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all memory and resources allocated by the ResourceEventBus object. This includes
    unregistering any event listeners, releasing references to subscribed callbacks,
    and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system. The destructor ensures
    that when a ResourceEventBus instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted,
    all associated event handling mechanisms are safely terminated without causing
    memory leaks or undefined behavior. This method should be called automatically
    by the C++ runtime when the object's lifetime ends, but may also be invoked manually
    if early cleanup is required.

  - title: Automatic destruction of ResourceEventBus
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    ResourceEventBus eventBus;\n    // Use eventBus...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when eventBus goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual destruction of ResourceEventBus
    code: 'ResourceEventBus* eventBus = new ResourceEventBus();

      // Use the eventBus...

      delete eventBus; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called automatically by the C++ runtime when
    an object goes out of scope. It's important to ensure that no other objects are
    still referencing this ResourceEventBus instance after destruction, as accessing
    destroyed objects leads to undefined behavior. The destructor should not throw
    exceptions to avoid potential issues during stack unwinding.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor on stack-allocated objects; let the
    compiler handle it automatically. Avoid calling delete on a pointer that has already
    been deleted or was never allocated with new. Manual destruction of ResourceEventBus
    instances should be done carefully to prevent resource leaks or access violations.
