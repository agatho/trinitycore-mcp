  class: Unit
  method: SetSilencedSchoolMask
  signature: void Unit::SetSilencedSchoolMask(int schoolMask)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the school mask that is silenced for the unit.
  description: This method sets the school mask that will be silenced for a unit,
    preventing any spell effects or actions from being applied to that specific school
    of magic. The method is typically used in conjunction with other silence-related
    functionality to control how spells affect a unit's behavior. This method does
    not directly apply silence to the unit but rather defines which school mask will
    be silenced. It is often used in scenarios where a unit needs to be prevented
    from casting or receiving certain types of spells, such as when applying a silence
    effect or during specific game mechanics like boss fights or special abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: schoolMask
    description: The school mask that will be silenced for the unit. This parameter
      defines which type of magic (or school) will be affected by the silence. Valid
      values include all possible school masks such as fire, frost, nature, shadow,
      holy, arcane, and physical.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      target->SetSilencedSchoolMask(SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      // Set silence for fire and frost school masks

      int mask = SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE | SCHOOL_MASK_FROST;

      target->SetSilencedSchoolMask(mask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other silence-related methods
    to control the behavior of units during combat or special events. It should be
    noted that this method does not directly apply silence but rather sets a mask
    that will be used by other functions to determine which school will be silenced.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may affect how spells
    are processed for the unit, especially in scenarios involving boss fights or special
    abilities where silence is applied. Improper usage can lead to unexpected behavior
    in combat.
