documentation:
  brief: Clears the cached market data within the EconomyManager.
  description: The ClearMarketCache method invalidates and removes all cached market-related
    data from the EconomyManager instance. This ensures that subsequent market queries
    will fetch fresh data from the database instead of using stale cached values.
    The method is typically invoked when market data needs to be refreshed or when
    cache consistency is required, such as after significant market modifications
    or during server maintenance periods. It does not affect active market transactions
    or ongoing auctions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyMgr;

      economyMgr->ClearMarketCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used judiciously as clearing the cache may impact performance
    if called frequently. It is recommended to only invoke this method when necessary,
    such as after major market updates or during server resets.
