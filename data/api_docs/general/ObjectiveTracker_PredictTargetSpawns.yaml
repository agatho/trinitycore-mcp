  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::PredictTargetSpawns(uint32 targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and updates spawn locations for tracked objectives based on target
    ID
  description: The PredictTargetSpawns method calculates and updates the expected
    spawn positions for objectives associated with a specific target ID. This functionality
    is typically used in quest tracking systems to anticipate where mobs or objects
    will appear next, allowing the objective tracker to maintain accurate visual indicators
    and progress updates. The method likely interacts with internal spawn point databases
    and timing mechanisms to determine future locations. It may be invoked automatically
    during quest updates or manually when target information changes.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier for the target whose spawns are to be predicted.
      This ID corresponds to a specific mob, object, or quest-related entity in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Predicting spawns for a quest target
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->PredictTargetSpawns(12345); // Predict spawns for target with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on the main thread and may trigger UI updates.
    It's designed to work in conjunction with other objective tracking methods and
    should be called after target data has been updated or validated.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the target ID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect spawn predictions. Ensure that the target ID
    corresponds to an actual tracked objective before invocation.
