  method: GetFaction
  signature: int Corpse::GetFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the faction ID associated with the corpse's owner.
  description: The GetFaction method retrieves the faction identifier that was assigned
    to the player at the time of their death, which determines the corpse's faction
    relationship in the game world. This value is used primarily for determining visibility
    and interaction behavior of the corpse by different players or factions. The returned
    faction ID corresponds to the player's original faction before death and does
    not change during the corpse's existence. This method is commonly used in corpse-related
    game mechanics such as loot distribution, corpse visibility checks, and faction-based
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the faction ID of the corpse's owner. This value
    corresponds to the faction template ID defined in the game's faction database
    and determines how other players or NPCs interact with the corpse based on their
    own faction relationships.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nint factionId = corpse->GetFaction();\n\
      if (factionId == FACTION_ALLIANCE)\n{\n    // Handle alliance corpse logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Corpse Visibility
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCorpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse\
      \ && corpse->GetFaction() == player->GetFaction())\n{\n    // Corpse is visible\
      \ to the player's faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The faction ID returned by this method is set when the corpse is created
    and remains constant throughout the corpse's lifetime. This value does not reflect
    any temporary faction changes or reputation modifications that might occur after
    death.
