  signature: void ChatHandler::SendGlobalGMSysMessage(const char * str)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a system message to all online Game Masters across the entire server.
  description: The SendGlobalGMSysMessage method broadcasts a specified system message
    to every currently logged-in Game Master character on the server. This functionality
    is typically used by administrative commands or scripts to communicate important
    information, alerts, or announcements directly to all GMs without requiring them
    to be in the same zone or instance. The message appears in the GM's chat window
    with a distinctive prefix indicating it's a global GM system message. This method
    does not require any specific parameters beyond the message string itself and
    operates synchronously across all connected sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: str
    description: A null-terminated character array containing the system message to
      be sent to all online Game Masters. The message should be properly formatted
      and localized for display.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SendGMAlert(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    handler->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"\
      Important maintenance scheduled in 30 minutes.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Variable Message
    code: "void BroadcastServerStatus(ChatHandler* handler, const char* status) {\n\
      \    std::string message = \"Server Status Update: \";\n    message += status;\n\
      \    handler->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(message.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method iterates through all active GM sessions and sends the message
    individually to each one. It's designed for urgent or administrative communications
    and should not be used excessively as it may impact server performance if called
    too frequently. The message is sent using the system channel, which is distinct
    from regular chat channels.
  warnings: Avoid sending large messages or spamming this function repeatedly as it
    could cause performance degradation. Ensure that the input string is properly
    null-terminated and does not contain malicious content that might be interpreted
    by clients.
