  class: GroupCoordination

  signature: void GroupCoordination::IssueCommand(uint32 memberGuid, CoordinationCommand
    command, const int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a coordination command to a group member with specified targets
  description: The IssueCommand method is used to dispatch a coordination command
    to a specific group member identified by their GUID. This method facilitates communication
    and control within group-based gameplay mechanics, such as managing loot distribution,
    movement coordination, or tactical actions during raids or dungeons. The command
    is sent to the designated member along with target information that may influence
    how the command is processed. This functionality is typically used in conjunction
    with group management systems to maintain synchronized gameplay experiences across
    multiple players.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member who will receive
      the coordination command. This must correspond to a valid player in the current
      group context.
  - name: command
    description: The CoordinationCommand enum value that specifies the type of action
      to be performed. Valid commands are defined within the CoordinationCommand enumeration
      and may include actions like loot rolling, movement orders, or tactical coordination.
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target(s) associated with
      the command. The interpretation of this value depends on the specific command
      being issued and may represent item IDs, player GUIDs, or other relevant identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IssueCommand
    code: "GroupCoordination* coordination = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination(player->GetGroupId());\n\
      if (coordination)\n{\n    CoordinationCommand cmd = COORDINATION_COMMAND_LOOT_ROLL;\n\
      \    int target = 12345; // Example item ID\n    coordination->IssueCommand(playerGuid,\
      \ cmd, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a movement coordination command
    code: "GroupCoordination* coordination = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination(group->GetId());\n\
      if (coordination)\n{\n    CoordinationCommand cmd = COORDINATION_COMMAND_MOVE_TO_POSITION;\n\
      \    int target = 0; // Position coordinates would be handled separately\n \
      \   coordination->IssueCommand(memberGuid, cmd, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group coordination system is properly initialized
    and that the specified member GUID exists within the current group context. The
    targets parameter should be interpreted according to the command type being issued.
    Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency
    gameplay events.
  warnings: Using invalid member GUIDs or incorrect command types may result in undefined
    behavior or failed command execution. Ensure that the target data is valid and
    appropriate for the specified command before calling this method.
