documentation:
  brief: Saves the item to the database with optional transaction handling
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the current item state to the database,
    ensuring that all item attributes and properties are properly stored. This method
    is typically called during item creation, modification, or when items are being
    saved in a transactional context. It handles the database operations required
    for item persistence, including saving item data such as stack count, enchantments,
    and durability. The method supports transactional operations through the optional
    trans parameter which allows for proper database transaction management.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Optional transaction identifier that specifies the database transaction
      context. If non-zero, the item will be saved within a transaction. If zero,
      the item is saved without transaction handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Saving Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SaveToDB(0);

      // Saves item without transaction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transaction-Based Item Saving
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SaveToDB(1);

      // Saves item within a transaction context'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles database connection and transaction management.
    It is important to note that this method should not be called during item creation
    or destruction processes, as it may cause conflicts with existing database operations.
    Performance considerations include the potential for blocking operations when
    saving large items.
  warnings: Calling SaveToDB on items that are already saved or have been deleted
    can lead to database errors or exceptions. The method should only be used when
    the item is in a valid state and not during critical game events like player logout
    or server shutdown.
