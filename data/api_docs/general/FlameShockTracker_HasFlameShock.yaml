documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Flame Shock effect.
  description: The HasFlameShock method determines whether a specific player currently
    has the Flame Shock spell applied to them. This method is typically used in combat
    logic to verify if a target is affected by the Flame Shock debuff, which is a
    key component of shaman spell rotation and damage application. The method performs
    a lookup within the internal tracking system to confirm the presence of the effect
    for the given player GUID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has an active Flame Shock effect;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (flameShockTracker.HasFlameShock(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is affected\
      \ by Flame Shock\n    DoAdditionalDamage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void ApplyFlameShock(Unit* target) {\n    if (!flameShockTracker.HasFlameShock(target->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n        // Apply new Flame Shock\n        target->AddAura(SPELL_FLAME_SHOCK,\
      \ caster);\n        flameShockTracker.AddFlameShock(target->GetGUID());\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FlameShockTracker maintains an internal data
    structure (likely a set or map) of active Flame Shock effects. It is optimized
    for fast lookup and should not be called excessively in performance-critical code
    paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid player
    unit; passing invalid or non-player GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results.
