documentation:
  brief: Reclaims unused memory from the combat AI integrator's internal data structures.
  description: The CompactMemory method is designed to optimize memory usage within
    the CombatAIIntegrator class by releasing memory that is no longer needed. This
    method is typically called during periodic cleanup operations or when the system
    detects that memory fragmentation has reached a certain threshold. It ensures
    that the AI integrator maintains efficient memory utilization without affecting
    active combat operations. The method does not require any parameters and performs
    its operation internally on the class's managed memory pools.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Compaction
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      // ... perform combat AI operations ...

      aiIntegrator.CompactMemory(); // Compact memory after heavy AI usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may involve internal memory
    reallocation and could potentially impact performance during high-frequency combat
    scenarios. It is recommended to call this method during idle periods or when the
    system detects sufficient memory pressure.
