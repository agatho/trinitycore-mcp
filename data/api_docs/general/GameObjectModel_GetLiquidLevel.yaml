  class: GameObjectModel
  method: GetLiquidLevel
  signature: bool GameObjectModel::GetLiquidLevel(const int & point, VMAP::LocationInfo
    & info, float & liqHeight) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the liquid level at a specified point within the game object's
    model.
  description: The GetLiquidLevel method determines the height of liquid (such as
    water or lava) at a given point within the GameObjectModel's boundaries. It uses
    the provided point coordinates to query the terrain's liquid data and returns
    whether a valid liquid height was found. This functionality is essential for determining
    if an object is submerged in liquid, calculating buoyancy effects, or handling
    interactions with liquid surfaces. The method requires a valid point coordinate
    and a LocationInfo structure to properly resolve the liquid level. It is typically
    used during collision detection or environmental interaction checks.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer reference representing the point identifier or index within
      the GameObjectModel's coordinate system. This value is used to locate a specific
      position for liquid level lookup.
  - name: info
    description: A reference to a VMAP::LocationInfo structure that provides contextual
      information about the location, including area data and terrain properties required
      for accurate liquid height determination.
  - name: liqHeight
    description: A reference to a float variable where the method will store the retrieved
      liquid height value if successful. This represents the Z-coordinate of the liquid
      surface at the specified point.
  returns: Returns true if a valid liquid level was found and successfully retrieved
    for the given point; otherwise, returns false if no liquid exists or an error
    occurred during lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObjectModel model;\nVMAP::LocationInfo info;\nfloat liquidHeight;\n\
      int point = 0;\nif (model.GetLiquidLevel(point, info, liquidHeight)) {\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Liquid height at point \" << point << \": \" << liquidHeight\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No liquid found at point \" <<\
      \ point << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Collision Check
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = GetGameObjectModel();\nVMAP::LocationInfo locationInfo;\n\
      float liquidLevel;\nint pointIndex = 5;\n\nif (model->GetLiquidLevel(pointIndex,\
      \ locationInfo, liquidLevel)) {\n    // Use liquid level for buoyancy or collision\
      \ logic\n    if (GetObjectHeight() < liquidLevel) {\n        SetSubmerged(true);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the VMAP system to access terrain and liquid data.
    Ensure that the GameObjectModel has been properly initialized with valid map data
    before calling this function. The point parameter should be within the bounds
    of the model's defined area for reliable results.
  warnings: Incorrect point indices or uninitialized LocationInfo structures can lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect liquid height values. Always validate input
    parameters before invoking this method.
