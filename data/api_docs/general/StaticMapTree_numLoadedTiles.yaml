  method: numLoadedTiles
  signature: uint32 StaticMapTree::numLoadedTiles() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of loaded map tiles in the static map tree.
  description: The numLoadedTiles method provides a count of all currently loaded
    map tiles within the StaticMapTree instance. This is useful for monitoring memory
    usage, debugging tile loading issues, or understanding the spatial coverage of
    loaded terrain data. The method does not perform any loading operations; it simply
    reports on tiles that are already resident in memory. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this relates to the static map tile system used for collision
    detection and navigation mesh data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total count of loaded map tiles. Returns
    zero if no tiles are currently loaded or if the tree is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Loaded Tiles
    code: "uint32 loadedCount = mapTree->numLoadedTiles();\nif (loadedCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Currently loaded %u map tiles\\n\", loadedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Tile Loading with Count Comparison
    code: 'uint32 initialCount = mapTree->numLoadedTiles();

      // ... perform some tile loading operations ...

      uint32 finalCount = mapTree->numLoadedTiles();

      printf("Tiles loaded: %u\n", finalCount - initialCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
    The returned count reflects only tiles that have been successfully loaded into
    memory, not those that are pending or scheduled for loading. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads existing data structures.
