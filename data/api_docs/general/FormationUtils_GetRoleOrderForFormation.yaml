  signature: int FormationUtils::GetRoleOrderForFormation(FormationType formation)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role order value associated with a specified formation type.
  description: The GetRoleOrderForFormation method retrieves an integer value representing
    the role order for a given formation type. This value is used internally by the
    game engine to determine how units should be positioned and ordered within a specific
    formation. The method takes a FormationType parameter which defines the type of
    formation being queried, and returns an integer that corresponds to the role order
    configuration for that formation. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper unit positioning and behavior in group-based gameplay mechanics such as
    player formations, NPC group behaviors, or tactical deployments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the role order associated with the
    specified formation type. The exact meaning of this value depends on the internal
    formation system implementation but typically corresponds to a priority or positioning
    index used for organizing units within a formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int roleOrder = FormationUtils::GetRoleOrderForFormation(FORMATION_TYPE_DEFAULT);

      // Returns the role order value for the default formation type'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger formation management system and may
    be used in conjunction with other FormationUtils methods to fully implement unit
    positioning logic. The actual mapping between formation types and role orders
    should be determined by internal game configuration data.
