documentation:
  brief: Moves a ChatHandler object, transferring its resources to another instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on a ChatHandler object,
    transferring all internal resources and state from the source object to the target
    object. This operation is typically used when moving ChatHandler instances between
    variables or containers, allowing for efficient resource management by avoiding
    unnecessary copying. The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, suitable for immediate destruction or assignment. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft server implementation, this method supports efficient handling
    of command handler objects within the game's chat system and scripting interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the ChatHandler object after the move assignment has been
    completed, enabling chained operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'ChatHandler handler1;

      ChatHandler handler2 = std::move(handler1); // Uses operator=

      // handler1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container
    code: 'std::vector<ChatHandler> handlers;

      ChatHandler newHandler;

      handlers.push_back(std::move(newHandler)); // Move-assigns to vector

      // newHandler is left in valid state for destruction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which is crucial for performance optimization
    when dealing with objects that manage significant resources. The moved-from ChatHandler
    object should not be used after the operation except for destruction or reassignment.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Using it for any operations other than destruction or assignment may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper handling of the moved-from object to avoid
    potential issues.
