  method: SearchSpellFocus
  signature: GameObject * Spell::SearchSpellFocus()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GameObject associated with spell focus for the current spell.
  description: The SearchSpellFocus method retrieves the GameObject that serves as
    the spell focus for the current spell being cast. This method is typically used
    in the context of spell mechanics where a spell requires a specific GameObject
    to be present in order to execute properly. The returned GameObject represents
    the focus object that the spell uses for its execution, which could be a game
    object like a portal, an aura source, or other special object required by the
    spell. This method is particularly important for spells that require specific
    spell focus objects to function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject that serves as the spell focus for
    the current spell. If no spell focus is found or the spell does not require one,
    this method may return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* focus = spell->SearchSpellFocus();\nif (focus != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the focus object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine if a spell can proceed based on the presence of required spell focus
    objects. It should be used carefully as it may return nullptr if no focus object
    exists for the current spell.
  warnings: This method should not be used in contexts where the spell focus object
    is expected to be present, as it may lead to runtime errors if the returned GameObject
    is null and not properly handled.
