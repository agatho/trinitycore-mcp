  class: Player
  method: SetNumRespecs
  signature: void Player::SetNumRespecs(uint8 numRespecs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of respecs available for the player.
  description: This method configures the player's respec count, which determines
    how many times a player can reset their talent tree. The respec count is typically
    used in conjunction with the SetRespecTime method to manage player talent reset
    mechanics. This method directly affects the player's ability to reconfigure their
    talents and is essential for implementing game balance mechanics related to talent
    resets.
  parameters:
  - name: numRespecs
    description: The number of respecs to set for the player, typically ranging from
      0-5. Values outside this range may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Respec Count
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetNumRespecs(3);

      // Sets the player''s respec count to 3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly impacts player talent
    reset mechanics. The value is typically set based on game rules or player level,
    and may require synchronization with other methods like SetRespecTime for complete
    reset functionality.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect talent reset behavior.
    Ensure that the respec count aligns with game balance requirements and player
    level restrictions.
