documentation:
  brief: Executes the holy words ability for a Holy Priest, applying effects to group
    members
  description: The HandleHolyWords method implements the core logic for the Holy Priest's
    holy words ability. This method processes the specified group of players and applies
    appropriate healing or protective effects based on the current game state and
    priest's resources. The method checks for valid group membership, ensures the
    priest has sufficient mana, and applies the necessary aura effects to all eligible
    targets within the group. It serves as the central handler for the holy words
    spell mechanics in the TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group members should receive
      the holy words effects. Valid values are typically group IDs from 0 to MAX_GROUP_SIZE,
      where -1 indicates the player's current group.
  returns: Returns true if the holy words ability was successfully executed and effects
    were applied to group members, false if execution failed due to insufficient resources,
    invalid group, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with current group
    code: "if (priest->HandleHolyWords(-1)) {\n    // Holy words successfully cast\
      \ on current group\n    sLog->outString(\"Holy Words cast successfully\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with specific group ID
    code: "const int groupId = 5;\nif (priest->HandleHolyWords(groupId)) {\n    //\
      \ Holy words cast on group with ID 5\n    sLog->outString(\"Holy Words cast\
      \ on group %d\", groupId);\n} else {\n    // Handle failed cast\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to cast Holy Words on group %d\", groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the priest has already validated that they are a Holy
    Priest and have the required spell learned. The method internally handles mana
    cost deduction, target validation, and effect application. Performance considerations
    include group size - larger groups may take longer to process. This method is
    thread-safe as long as proper locking mechanisms are in place for shared resources.
  warnings: This method does not validate if the priest has line of sight or other
    spell restrictions beyond mana availability. It's important to ensure that the
    calling code properly validates these conditions before invoking this method.
    The group parameter should be validated to prevent out-of-bounds access to group
    members.
