documentation:
  brief: Copies loot conditions from the template to a specific loot item.
  description: The CopyConditions method transfers condition data from a LootTemplate
    instance to a specified LootItem. This ensures that the loot item inherits the
    same conditional requirements as defined in the template, such as required quest
    completion, faction standings, or item requirements. The method is typically called
    during the loot distribution process to properly apply all conditions before determining
    whether a player can receive the loot. It operates on a per-item basis and does
    not modify the original template's condition data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying Conditions to a Loot Item
    code: 'LootTemplate* lootTemplate = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplate(12345);

      LootItem* lootItem = new LootItem();

      lootTemplate->CopyConditions(lootItem);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot system in TrinityCore and is usually
    invoked internally during loot generation. Developers should ensure that the LootItem
    pointer passed to this method is properly initialized before calling the function.
