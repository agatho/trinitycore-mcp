  brief: Appends player invite ban data to a channel notification packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with information about banned players in a channel. This method is typically
    used when sending channel-related notifications to clients, specifically to inform
    them about which players are banned from joining or participating in a particular
    channel. The method operates on the internal data structure of PlayerInviteBannedAppend
    and adds the relevant ban information to the provided notification packet. It
    does not require any parameters as it uses the object's internal state to determine
    what data to append.
  parameters: []
  returns: No return value
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel management
    code: 'PlayerInviteBannedAppend banList;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      banList.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore.
    It's typically called during channel operations when client synchronization is
    needed, such as when a player joins a channel or when channel data needs to be
    refreshed. The method assumes that the PlayerInviteBannedAppend object has been
    properly initialized with ban data before calling Append.
