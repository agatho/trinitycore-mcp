  brief: Moves a GossipMenu object to another, transferring ownership of its resources
  description: The move assignment operator for GossipMenu transfers all resources
    from the source GossipMenu object to the target object. This operation is typically
    used when you want to efficiently transfer the contents of one GossipMenu instance
    to another without performing expensive deep copies. After the move, the source
    object will be left in a valid but unspecified state. This method is part of the
    standard C++ move semantics and is particularly useful in scenarios involving
    temporary objects or when returning objects from functions. In the context of
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this operator ensures efficient
    handling of gossip menu data structures during NPC interaction logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target GossipMenu object after the move operation has
    completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'GossipMenu menu1;

      GossipMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1); // Uses move assignment

      // menu1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Return Context
    code: "GossipMenu createGossipMenu() {\n    GossipMenu menu;\n    // populate\
      \ menu...\n    return menu; // Move semantics automatically applied\n}\n\nGossipMenu\
      \ mainMenu = createGossipMenu(); // Move assignment used here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using std::move semantics and should
    only be used when you no longer need the source object. The moved-from object
    remains in a valid state but its contents are unspecified, so avoid accessing
    them after the move operation.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object or accessing the source
    object afterward results in undefined behavior. Always ensure that the source
    object is not used after a move assignment.
