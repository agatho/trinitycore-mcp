  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: LoadStrategies
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::LoadStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads AI strategies for bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The LoadStrategies method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all available AI strategies that bots can utilize in World of Warcraft through
    the TrinityCore emulator. This method typically reads configuration files or database
    entries to determine which strategies should be active for different types of
    bot behavior, such as combat, movement, or quest completion. It ensures that each
    bot character has access to appropriate decision-making logic based on their role
    and assigned class. The method performs necessary setup operations including strategy
    validation, loading required data structures, and preparing internal state for
    AI execution. This initialization step is crucial for proper bot functionality
    and must be called before any bot AI processing occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all strategies were successfully loaded and initialized;
    returns false if there was an error during the loading process, such as missing
    configuration files or invalid strategy definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nbool success = initializer.LoadStrategies();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // AI strategies loaded successfully\n    // Bot AI can\
      \ now be initialized\n} else {\n    // Handle loading failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load bot AI strategies\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    new bots are added to the game world. The implementation may involve reading from
    configuration files, database tables, or other persistent storage mechanisms.
    It's recommended to call this method before attempting to assign AI behaviors
    to any bot characters.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate strategy registrations. Ensure that the underlying AI
    system is properly shut down before reloading strategies if needed.
