  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the performance optimizer, cleaning up resources and stopping
    active operations.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all ongoing
    performance optimization activities within the PerformanceOptimizer class. It
    ensures that any active threads, timers, or monitoring processes are properly
    stopped and cleaned up. This method should be called before the application exits
    or when the performance optimizer needs to be disabled temporarily. The shutdown
    process typically involves signaling running tasks to terminate, releasing allocated
    memory, and ensuring no dangling references remain in the system.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer* optimizer = new PerformanceOptimizer();

      // ... perform some operations ...

      optimizer->Shutdown();

      delete optimizer;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system cleanup or when the server
    is shutting down. It's important to ensure that no other threads are actively
    using the PerformanceOptimizer instance before calling Shutdown, as this could
    lead to race conditions or undefined behavior.
