documentation:
  brief: Calculates the delay before a player can reclaim their corpse after death.
  description: This method determines the time delay (in seconds) before a player
    can reclaim their corpse following death. The calculation considers factors such
    as the player's level, the presence of a corpse, and whether the player is in
    a sanctuary zone. It returns the number of seconds to wait before the corpse can
    be reclaimed, with a default value of 30 seconds for low-level players and 15
    seconds for higher-level players. The method is used internally by the game engine
    to enforce corpse reclaim rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the delay in seconds before the player
    can reclaim their corpse. A value of 0 indicates immediate reclaim, while positive
    values indicate a waiting period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 delay = player->CalculateCorpseReclaimDelay();\nif (delay > 0)\n\
      \    printf(\"Corpse reclaim delay: %d seconds\\n\", delay);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the death process and affects the
    time a player must wait before their corpse can be reclaimed. The delay may vary
    based on game mechanics such as level, zone type, and player's current status.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by external code; it's intended
    for internal use only. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior or game
    rule violations.
