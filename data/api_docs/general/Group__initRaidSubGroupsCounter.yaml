  signature: void Group::_initRaidSubGroupsCounter()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the internal counter used for tracking raid sub-group assignments
    within the group.
  description: The _initRaidSubGroupsCounter method initializes an internal counter
    that is used to manage and track the assignment of players to sub-groups within
    a raid. This method is typically called during group initialization or when transitioning
    a party into a raid structure. It ensures that each member of the group is properly
    assigned to a unique sub-group index, which is essential for maintaining proper
    raid organization and functionality in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
    The counter is usually reset to zero before starting new assignments, ensuring
    a clean state for sub-group management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialization of Raid Sub-Group Counter
    code: "void ExampleClass::SetupRaid() {\n    Group* group = GetGroup();\n    if\
      \ (group) {\n        group->_initRaidSubGroupsCounter();\n        // Proceed\
      \ with raid setup logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal utility function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It's typically invoked automatically during group creation or
    when converting a party to a raid. The counter initialization ensures that sub-group
    indices start from zero and increment properly as members are assigned.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper group state management may
    lead to incorrect sub-group assignments or unexpected behavior in raid operations.
    This is an internal method and its direct usage should be avoided unless absolutely
    necessary for advanced group management logic.
