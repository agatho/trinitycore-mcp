  class: MonkAI
  method: ExecuteWindwalkerRotation
  signature: void MonkAI::ExecuteWindwalkerRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Windwalker monk rotation logic for the AI-controlled character.
  description: The ExecuteWindwalkerRotation method implements the core combat decision-making
    logic for a Windwalker monk AI. It evaluates the current combat state, target
    conditions, and available abilities to determine the optimal sequence of actions.
    This method typically manages the use of abilities such as Tiger Palm, Spinning
    Crane Kick, and other Windwalker-specific mechanics while maintaining proper resource
    management and cooldown tracking. The method is designed to be called during the
    AI's update cycle to ensure consistent and efficient combat performance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID or index for the
      current combat target. This parameter allows the AI to identify which entity
      it should prioritize in its rotation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteWindwalkerRotation
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        ExecuteWindwalkerRotation(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already selected a valid combat target
    and that all necessary combat state information is accessible. The implementation
    may rely on internal AI state tracking and should be called within the appropriate
    update loop context for optimal performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer may cause undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called outside of combat or when the AI is not properly
    initialized.
