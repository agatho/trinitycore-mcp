  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: ExecuteAsync
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::ExecuteAsync(int * stmt, int callback,
    uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a database statement asynchronously with a specified callback and
    timeout.
  description: The ExecuteAsync method initiates an asynchronous database operation
    using a prepared statement, allowing the calling thread to continue execution
    without blocking. It accepts a statement identifier, a callback function to be
    invoked upon completion, and a timeout value in milliseconds. This method is commonly
    used in player bot systems to perform non-blocking database operations such as
    saving character data or retrieving configuration settings. The asynchronous nature
    helps maintain game performance by preventing database queries from freezing the
    main game loop.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the prepared database statement
      to execute. This typically references a pre-compiled SQL statement stored in
      the database interface.
  - name: callback
    description: Integer identifier for the callback function that will be executed
      when the database operation completes. The callback is responsible for handling
      the result or any error conditions from the asynchronous operation.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Timeout value in milliseconds for the database operation. If the
      operation does not complete within this time, it may be cancelled or marked
      as failed depending on implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic asynchronous database execution
    code: 'int statementId = characterDB->PrepareStatement(SQL_INIT_PLAYER);

      int callbackId = 12345;

      playerbotDbInterface->ExecuteAsync(&statementId, callbackId, 5000);

      // Operation continues without blocking the main thread'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in asynchronous database operations within
    the player bot system. It's important to ensure that the statement and callback
    identifiers are valid and properly registered with the database interface before
    calling this method. The timeout value should be chosen carefully to balance responsiveness
    with potential long-running queries.
  warnings: Improper handling of the callback function may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory corruption. Ensure that all resources referenced by the statement are
    valid throughout the execution period. Using invalid statement or callback identifiers
    can cause crashes or unexpected behavior in the database interface.
