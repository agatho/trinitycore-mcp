documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for frost mage abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures the internal
    cooldown management system for a frost mage character. This method ensures that
    all frost-related spells and abilities have their cooldown timers properly initialized,
    allowing the spell system to accurately track when each ability can be cast again.
    It typically runs during the initialization phase of a frost mage's AI or when
    a new frost mage instance is created. The method prepares the cooldown framework
    without actually starting any cooldowns, ensuring that subsequent spell casting
    operations can correctly manage and enforce cooldown restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'FrostMageRefactored frostMage;

      frostMage.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldown system is now ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization of a FrostMageRefactored
    instance. It does not reset or clear existing cooldowns, but rather prepares the
    internal structures needed for cooldown tracking. The method assumes that the
    underlying spell system and ability data are already loaded and available.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks if not properly designed to be idempotent. Ensure that
    this method is only invoked once per frost mage instance during setup.
