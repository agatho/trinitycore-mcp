  class: Player
  method: SetWarModeDesired
  signature: void Player::SetWarModeDesired(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's war mode state to enabled or disabled.
  description: This method controls whether a player is in war mode, which affects
    their ability to engage in PvP combat and determines their visibility to other
    players. When enabled, the player enters war mode and can attack other players,
    while disabled removes them from war mode. The method does not immediately change
    the player's state but rather sets a desired state that will be applied at the
    appropriate time. This is typically used for setting war mode during player initialization
    or when changing states in response to game events.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether war mode should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetWarModeDesired(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting war mode based on game state
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (IsPvPActive())\n{\n    player->SetWarModeDesired(true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->SetWarModeDesired(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other war mode related
    methods and may be called during player initialization or when handling game events.
    The actual war mode state change occurs at a later time based on game mechanics,
    not immediately upon calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly set war mode state without
    considering the broader context of PvP gameplay. Setting war mode incorrectly
    may lead to unexpected behavior in player vs player combat or visibility.
