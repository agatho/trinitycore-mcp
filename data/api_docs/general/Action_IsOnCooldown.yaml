documentation:
  brief: Checks if the action is currently on cooldown
  description: The IsOnCooldown method determines whether a given action is currently
    in a cooldown state, meaning it cannot be executed again until the cooldown period
    has expired. This method is commonly used in AI scripts and player behavior logic
    to prevent actions from being performed too frequently. The check typically involves
    verifying the internal cooldown timer associated with the action against the current
    game time. This functionality is essential for implementing proper game balance
    and preventing spamming of abilities or items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action is currently on cooldown, false otherwise. A
    return value of true indicates that the action cannot be executed at this moment
    due to an active cooldown timer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown check in AI logic
    code: "if (action->IsOnCooldown())\n{\n    // Skip this action and try another\n\
      \    return false;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with the action\n    action->Execute();\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cooldown check to prevent spamming
    code: "if (!playerAction->IsOnCooldown())\n{\n    playerAction->CastSpell(target);\n\
      \    playerAction->StartCooldown(3000); // 3 second cooldown\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Action is on cooldown, do nothing or log message\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Action is still on cooldown\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal cooldown tracking system of the action.
    It's important to note that cooldowns are typically managed per-action instance
    and may be affected by various game mechanics such as haste, cooldown reduction
    effects, or item bonuses. The method does not modify any state - it only reads
    the current cooldown status.
  warnings: Be aware that checking cooldown status in tight loops without proper delay
    mechanisms can lead to performance issues. Also, some actions might have different
    cooldown behaviors based on game context (e.g., PvP vs PvE), so ensure your logic
    accounts for these variations if needed.
