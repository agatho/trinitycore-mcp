  class: InterruptManager
  method: GetInterruptCapabilityCount
  signature: uint32 InterruptManager::GetInterruptCapabilityCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of interrupt capabilities available within the
    InterruptManager instance.
  description: The GetInterruptCapabilityCount method returns the number of interrupt
    capabilities currently registered or managed by this InterruptManager instance.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, interrupt capabilities typically
    refer to abilities or spells that can interrupt ongoing actions, such as casting
    spells or melee attacks. This count is essential for determining how many interrupts
    are available for processing during combat scenarios or other gameplay events.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational, making
    it safe to call at any time during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of interrupt capabilities
    stored in this InterruptManager instance. This count includes all valid interrupt
    entries that have been added or initialized within the manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 interruptCount = interruptManager.GetInterruptCapabilityCount();\n\
      if (interruptCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interrupt handling logic\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Found %u interrupt capabilities.\", interruptCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the game
    engine where knowing the number of available interrupts helps optimize decision-making
    processes during combat. The count returned reflects only those interrupts that
    are currently valid and registered, not including any temporary or pending entries.
