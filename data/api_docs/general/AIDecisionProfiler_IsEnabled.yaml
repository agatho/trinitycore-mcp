  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool AIDecisionProfiler::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the AI decision profiler is currently enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the AI decision profiling functionality
    is active within the TrinityCore server. This profiling mechanism allows developers
    and administrators to monitor and analyze the decision-making processes of AI-controlled
    entities, such as NPCs or creatures. When enabled, the profiler collects data
    about AI decisions made during gameplay, which can be used for debugging, performance
    optimization, or balancing adjustments. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current state of the profiling system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI decision profiler is currently enabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (aiDecisionProfiler.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Profiling is active\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"AI Decision Profiler is enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Profiling Control
    code: "void ToggleAIDecisionProfiling() {\n    if (aiDecisionProfiler.IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        aiDecisionProfiler.Disable();\n        sLog->outString(\"AI Decision\
      \ Profiler disabled\");\n    } else {\n        aiDecisionProfiler.Enable();\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"AI Decision Profiler enabled\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Enable() and Disable()
    methods to control profiling during development or debugging sessions. The profiler
    state may be controlled via server configuration options or console commands.
