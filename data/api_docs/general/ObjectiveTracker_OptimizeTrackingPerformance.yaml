  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: OptimizeTrackingPerformance
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::OptimizeTrackingPerformance(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes objective tracking performance for the specified player bot by
    adjusting tracking behavior and reducing resource consumption.
  description: The OptimizeTrackingPerformance method is designed to enhance the efficiency
    of objective tracking within the TrinityCore framework, particularly for AI-controlled
    player bots. This method modifies internal tracking mechanisms to minimize CPU
    and memory usage while maintaining functional integrity of quest and objective
    tracking systems. It typically adjusts how frequently objectives are polled, reduces
    unnecessary updates, and streamlines data processing for bot players. The optimization
    is especially relevant in scenarios involving multiple bots or high-density gameplay
    where performance overhead needs to be minimized. This method should be called
    during initialization or when transitioning a player into bot mode to ensure optimal
    tracking behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose objective
      tracking performance will be optimized. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for optimizing a bot's tracking
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object

      ObjectiveTracker::OptimizeTrackingPerformance(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in bot initialization context
    code: "void InitializeBot(Player* bot)\n{\n    // Other bot setup code...\n  \
      \  ObjectiveTracker::OptimizeTrackingPerformance(bot);\n    // Continue with\
      \ bot initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal tracking flags or polling intervals
    for the specified bot. It may also adjust how frequently objective updates are
    sent to the client, potentially reducing network traffic. The optimization is
    specific to bot players and should not be applied to real player characters.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents a bot
    (not a real player) before calling this method. Applying it to a real player may
    cause unexpected behavior in objective tracking systems.
