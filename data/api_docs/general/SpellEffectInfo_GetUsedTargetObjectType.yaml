  signature: SpellTargetObjectTypes SpellEffectInfo::GetUsedTargetObjectType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target object type used by a spell effect.
  description: The GetUsedTargetObjectType method returns the SpellTargetObjectTypes
    enumeration value that indicates what type of target objects (such as units, game
    objects, or areas) are expected or utilized by this specific spell effect. This
    information is crucial for determining how the spell effect processes its targets
    during execution and helps in validating target selection logic within the TrinityCore
    spell system. The returned value typically corresponds to predefined target types
    like TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, or TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_AREA,
    which influence how the spell's effects are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellTargetObjectTypes enumeration value indicating the type of target
    objects used by this spell effect. Possible values include but are not limited
    to TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, and TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_AREA.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellEffectInfo const* effect = spellInfo->GetEffect(0);\nSpellTargetObjectTypes\
      \ targetType = effect->GetUsedTargetObjectType();\nif (targetType == TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT)\n\
      {\n    // Handle unit-targeted spell effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell effect handling system in TrinityCore
    and should be used primarily during spell processing or validation phases. It
    does not perform any runtime computations but rather returns a pre-defined constant
    value based on the spell effect definition.
