  method: FindEscapeRoutes
  signature: int KitingUtils::FindEscapeRoutes(const int & current, const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal escape route for a unit based on threat
    positioning.
  description: The FindEscapeRoutes method determines the best possible movement path
    for a unit to evade incoming threats. It evaluates the current position of the
    unit against the positions of surrounding hostile entities, calculating an escape
    vector that maximizes distance from all active threats. This utility is primarily
    used in AI behavior systems where units need to make tactical decisions about
    retreat or repositioning during combat. The method assumes that both the current
    position and threat positions are represented as integer coordinates within a
    grid-based system, with higher values indicating greater threat intensity or proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: current
    description: An integer representing the current position of the unit in the game
      world. This value typically corresponds to a grid coordinate or spatial index
      used for pathfinding calculations.
  - name: threats
    description: An integer representing the aggregated threat level or positioning
      data from hostile entities. This parameter may encode multiple threat sources
      through bit manipulation or represent a combined threat score based on proximity
      and danger level.
  returns: Returns an integer value that represents the calculated optimal escape
    route index or direction. A return value of -1 typically indicates no valid escape
    path could be determined, while positive values correspond to specific movement
    directions or indices in a predefined routing table.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Escape Route Calculation
    code: "int currentPos = 50;\nint threatLevel = 120;\nint escapeRoute = KitingUtils::FindEscapeRoutes(currentPos,\
      \ threatLevel);\nif (escapeRoute >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement along\
      \ the calculated route\n    printf(\"Escape route index: %d\\n\", escapeRoute);\n\
      } else {\n    // No valid escape path available\n    printf(\"No escape route\
      \ found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in real-time tactical decision-making systems
    and assumes that threat data is updated frequently. The implementation likely
    involves spatial calculations and may utilize lookup tables or precomputed movement
    costs for performance optimization. Developers should ensure that the input coordinates
    are within valid ranges to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters, so invalid coordinate values
    may lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, this function is intended for use
    in AI systems where threat data is continuously updated; using stale threat information
    can result in suboptimal escape routes.
