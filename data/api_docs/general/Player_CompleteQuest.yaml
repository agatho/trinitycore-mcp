documentation:
  brief: Completes a quest for the player, marking it as rewarded and removing it
    from the quest log.
  description: The CompleteQuest method is used to mark a specific quest as completed
    for the player. This method handles the removal of the quest from the player's
    quest log, updates the quest status, and triggers the necessary rewards such as
    experience points, gold, and quest items. It also ensures that the quest is properly
    marked as completed in the database, allowing the player to receive credit for
    completing the quest. The method does not require any parameters beyond the quest
    ID itself, making it straightforward to use.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that needs to be completed. This
      value must correspond to a valid quest in the database, otherwise the method
      will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      player->CompleteQuest(questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    such as Quest::GetQuestStatus or Quest::CompleteQuest. It should be called after
    verifying that the player has met all quest requirements, such as killing monsters
    or collecting items. The method does not directly handle reward distribution;
    instead, it relies on the core system to properly distribute rewards upon completion.
  warnings: This method will not work if the quest ID is invalid or if the player
    does not have the quest in their quest log. It also does not account for quest
    requirements such as item collection or mob killing, which must be handled before
    calling this method.
