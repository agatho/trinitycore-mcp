  class: ClearcastingTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void ClearcastingTracker::ActivateProc(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Activates the clearcasting proc effect with the specified number of stacks.
  description: The ActivateProc method is used to trigger the clearcasting buff state
    within the ClearcastingTracker class. This method typically sets or increases
    the stack count of the clearcasting effect, which allows certain spells to be
    cast without mana cost or cooldown. The method is commonly invoked when a player
    triggers a clearcasting proc through abilities like Improved Scorch or other similar
    effects in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. It modifies internal state
    variables to reflect the active proc and may update the aura duration or stack
    count accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to apply to the clearcasting proc effect. Valid
      values are typically positive integers representing the number of times the
      proc has occurred or should be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ClearcastingTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(1); // Activate one stack of clearcasting'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Stacks Activation
    code: 'ClearcastingTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(3); // Apply three stacks of clearcasting proc'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the aura system and spell casting mechanics.
    It may reset or extend existing clearcasting auras, depending on implementation
    details. The stacks parameter should be validated to prevent negative values or
    excessive stack counts that could cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper checks can lead to incorrect
    stacking behavior or invalid aura states. Ensure that the number of stacks passed
    is within acceptable bounds for the game mechanics being emulated.
