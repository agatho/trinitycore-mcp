  class: Trigger
  method: CheckConditions
  signature: bool Trigger::CheckConditions(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and determines if all conditions for a trigger are met within the
    AI context.
  description: The CheckConditions method assesses whether all predefined conditions
    associated with a Trigger object are satisfied in the given BotAI context. This
    method is typically used during AI decision-making processes to validate if a
    trigger should be activated or if certain actions should be taken. It evaluates
    various criteria such as player state, environment factors, and game events that
    may influence the trigger's activation. The method returns true if all conditions
    are met, otherwise false. This functionality is essential for implementing complex
    AI behaviors in TrinityCore's bot system where triggers control when specific
    actions or scripts are executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether all conditions for the trigger
    are satisfied. True indicates that all conditions are met and the trigger can
    proceed, while false means at least one condition failed and the trigger should
    not be activated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Condition Check
    code: "if (trigger.CheckConditions(ai)) {\n    // Execute trigger action\n   \
      \ ai->ExecuteTriggerAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior Based on Trigger
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (trigger.CheckConditions(this)) {\n  \
      \      // Perform specific bot behavior\n        DoCombatStrategy();\n    }\
      \ else {\n        // Default behavior\n        DoIdleBehavior();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be efficient
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. The conditions evaluation may involve checking
    player health, distance to targets, inventory status, or other game state variables.
    Since this is part of the BotAI system, ensure that the AI context passed is valid
    and properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not call CheckConditions without ensuring that the BotAI pointer is
    valid and properly initialized. Improper use may lead to segmentation faults or
    undefined behavior. Also, be aware that condition evaluation might involve complex
    logic that could impact performance if conditions are overly complicated or numerous.
