documentation:
  brief: Returns the name link of the player in the CLI context
  description: The GetNameLink method retrieves the name link associated with the
    current CLI handler instance, typically used to reference or identify a specific
    player within the game's command-line interface. This method is commonly employed
    in TrinityCore's administrative and debugging commands where player identification
    is required. The returned value represents a formatted string that can be used
    for linking or referencing players in various game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the identifier or index of the name link associated
    with the CLI handler instance. This typically corresponds to a player's GUID or
    internal reference number within the TrinityCore system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int nameLink = handler->GetNameLink();\nif (nameLink > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the name link\n    sLog->outString(\"Player name link: %d\", nameLink);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other CLI handler functions
    to manage player interactions and administrative commands. The return value should
    be validated before use as it may represent an invalid or non-existent player
    reference.
  warnings: The method may return zero or negative values when no valid player context
    exists, so proper error checking is recommended. Using this method outside of
    a valid CLI context may produce undefined behavior.
