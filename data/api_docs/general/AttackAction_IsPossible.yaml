documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an attack action is possible for the bot AI
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if a bot AI can execute an attack action
    based on current game state and conditions. It checks various factors such as
    target validity, weapon availability, line of sight, and combat readiness. This
    method serves as a pre-condition check before attempting to initiate an attack,
    ensuring that the bot only attempts actions that are logically and mechanically
    feasible within the World of Warcraft environment. The result directly influences
    whether the AI proceeds with attack-related behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the attack action can be executed under current conditions,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the bot lacks
    a valid target, has no weapon equipped, or is otherwise unable to perform the
    attack action at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (attackAction.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    ai->Attack();\n} else {\n    ai->SetNextAction(Action::MoveToTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI decision cycles to ensure
    that attack actions are only attempted when conditions permit. It's designed to
    be lightweight and fast, as it may be invoked multiple times per game tick.
